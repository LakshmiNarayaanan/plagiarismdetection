The system applies alphabetical order only in page names, namely in the following features:
Special:Allpages
Categories
They are in Unicode order; the range 32-127 corresponds to ASCII. For more information on non-ASCII special characters, see Help:Special characters.
Thus, the following partial list shows the order:
!"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@

Note in particular that "Z" comes before "a", and "z" before "é". The blank space within a page name is treated as an underscore, and therefore comes after the capitals, and before the lower case letters. However, a "blank space" after the name comes before any character. Sometimes a special character looks like a regular letter, but has a special code anyway.
