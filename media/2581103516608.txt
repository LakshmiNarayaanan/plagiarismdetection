The Cloud computing is a latest
 
technology which provides various services through internet. The Cloud 
server allows user to store their data on a cloud without worrying about correctness & integrity of data. Cloud data 
storage has many advantages over local data storage. User can uploa
d their data on cloud and can access those data 

cloud data. But as data is stored at the remote place how users will get the confirmation about 
stored data. Hence Cloud 
data storage should have some mechanism which will specify storage correctness and integrity of data stored on a cloud. 
The major problem of cloud data storage is security. Many researchers have proposed their work or new algorithm
s to 
achieve security or to resolve this security problem. In this paper, we propose a secure cloud storage system supporting 
privacy
-
preserving public auditing. We further extend our result to enable the TPA to perform audits for multiple users 
simultaneo
usly and efficiently. Extensive security and performance analysis show the proposed schemes are provably 
secure and highly efficient.

Cloud Computing is using hard
ware and software as computing resources to provide service through 
internet. Cloud computing provides various service models as platform as a service (PaaS), software as a service 
(SaaS), Infrastructure as a service (Iaas), storage as a service (STaaS), s
ecurity as a service (SECaaS), Data as a 
service (DaaS) & many more. Out of this Paas, SaaS and IaaS are most popular. Cloud computing has four 
models as Public cloud: though which the service is available to all public use. Private cloud: Through which 
se
rvice is available to private enterprise or organization. Community Cloud: It allows us to share infrastructure 
among various organizations through which we can achieve security, compliance and jurisdiction. This can be 
managed internally or by a third
-
par
ty and hosted internally or externally. Hybrid cloud: it is a combination of 
public and private cloud. Cloud computing has many advantages as: we can easily upload and download the 
data stored in the cloud without worrying about security. We can access the
 
data from anywhere, any time on 
demand. Cost is low or pay per usage basis. Hardware and software resources are easily available without 
location independent. The major disadvantages of cloud computing is security.

Security Issues
 
 
The security is a ma
jor issue in cloud computing. It is a sub domain of computer security, network security 
or else data security. The cloud computing security refers to a broad set of policies, technology & controls 
deployed to protect data, application & the associated infr
astructure of cloud computing. Some security and 
privacy issues that need to be considered are as follows
 
 
1) Authentication:
 
Only authorized user can access data in the cloud.
 
 
2) Correctness of data:
 
This is the way through which user will get the confir
mation that the data stored in the 
cloud is secure.
 
 
3) Availability:
 
The cloud data should be easily available and accessible without any burden. The user should 
access the cloud data as if he is accessing local data.
 
 
4) No storage Overhead and easy main
tenance:
 

maintenance of the data on a cloud. 
 
 
5) No data Leakage:
 
The user data stored on a cloud can accessed by only authorize the user or owner. So all the 
contents are accessible by only autho
rize the user. 
 
 
6) No Data Loss:
 
Provider may hide data loss on a cloud for the user to maintain their reputation. In cloud 
computing, cloud data storage contains two entities as cloud user and cloud service provider cloud server.
 
 
 
Cloud user is a person
 
who stores large amount of data on cloud server which is managed by the cloud 
service provider. User can upload their data on cloud without worrying about storage and maintenance. A cloud 
service provider will provide services to cloud user. The major iss
ue in cloud data storage is to obtain 
correctness and integrity of data stored on the cloud. Cloud Service Provider (CSP) has to provide some form of 
mechanism through which user will get the confirmation that cloud data is secure or is stored as it is. No
 
data 
loss or modification is done.
 
 
The correctness of data can be violated due to a broad range of both internal and external threats and CSP may 
hide data loss or damage from users to maintain a reputation. Major security issues associated with cloud us
er 
and CSP are as follows:
 
 
1) Cloud Service Provider (CSP):
 
Organization or enterprises provide various services to cloud users. 

data and appli
cation are secured on a cloud. CSP may not leak the information or else cannot modify or access 

 
 
2) Cloud Server (CS):
 
The cloud server where data being stored and accessed by cloud data 
owner or users. 
Data should not be accessed by unauthorized users, no data modification or no loss of data.
 
 
3) Cloud User:
 
Attackers can access basic information like username and password [9]. Key management is 
major issue in encryption techniques. Data 
dynamic issues need to be considered by CSP. Cloud Computing 
Threads [9] are as follows:

To achi
eve security, we can handover our data to a third outsource party who will specify the correctness 
and integrity of the cloud data. Hence, new concept arrives as Third party auditor (TPA) who will audit the user 


worry about the correctness and integrity of the data. In this technique, TPA will audit the cloud data to check 
the integrity or correctness in two ways as:
 
 
1) Download all files and dat
a from the cloud for auditing. This may include I/O and network transmission cost.
 
2) Apply auditing process only for accessing the data but again in this case, data loss or data damage cannot be 
defined for unaccessed data. Public audit ability allows use
r to check integrity of outsource data under different

system & security models. We cannot achieve privacy as TPA can see the actual content stored on a cloud 
during the auditing phase. TPA itself may leak the information stored in the cloud which violate 
data security. 
To avoid this, Encryption technique is used where data is encrypted before storing it on the cloud.

RELATED
 
WORK
 
A.
 
MAC Based Solution
 
 
 
It is used to authenticate the data. In this, user
 
upload data blocks and MAC to CS provide its secret ke
y SK
 
to TPA. The TPA will randomly retrieve data blocks & Mac
 
uses secret key to check correctness of stored data 
on the
 
cloud. Problems with this system are listed below as:
 

 
It introduces additional online burden to users due to limited use (i.e. Bounded 
usage) and stateful 
verification.
 

 
Communication & computation complexity.
 

 
TPA requires knowledge of data blocks for verification.
 

 
Limitation on data files to be audited as secret keys are fixed.
 

 
After usages of all possible secret keys, the user has to dow
nload all the data to recomputed MAC & 
republish it on CS.
 

 
TPA should maintain & update states for TPA which is very difficult.
 

 
It supports only for static data not for dynamic data.
 
B.
 
HLA Based Solution
 
 
 
It supports efficient public auditing without retrie
ving data block. It is aggregated and required constant 
bandwidth. It is possible to compute an aggregate HLA which authenticates a linear combination of the 
individual data blocks.
 
 

 
Privacy Preserving Public Auditing Proposed by Cong Wang 
 
 
 
Public auditi
ng allows TPA along with user to check the
 
integrity of the outsourced data stored on a cloud 
& Privacy
 
Preserving allows TPA to do auditing without requesting for
 
local copy of the data. Through this 
scheme [1], TPA can
 
audit the data and cloud data priva
cy is maintained. It contains
 
4 algorithms as
 
 
1) 
Keygen:
 
It is a key generation algorithm used by the user to setup the scheme.
 
2) 
Singen
: 
It is used by the user to generate verification metadata which may include digital signature.
 
3) 
GenProof
: 
It is use
d by CS to generate a proof of data storage correctness.
 
4) 
Verifyproof
: 
Used by TPA to audit the proofs It is divided into two parts as setup phase and audit phase.
 
 
1) 
Setup P
hase: 
Public and secret parameters are initialized by using keygen and data fil
es f are 
pre
-
processes
 
by using singen to generate verification metadata at CS & delete its local copy. In 
pre
-
processing
 
user can alter 
data files F.
 
2) 
Audit
 
Phase: 
TPA issues an audit message to CS. The CS will derive a response message by executing 
Gen
proof. TPA verifies the response using F and its verification metadata. TPA is stateless i.e. no need to 
maintain or update the state information of audit phase. Public key based homomorphic linear authentication 
with random masking technique is used to ac
hieve privacy preserving public auditing. TPA checks the integrity 
of the outsourced data stored on a cloud without accessing actual contents. Existing research work of proof of 

ider data privacy problem. PDP 
scheme first proposed by Ateniese et al. used to detect large amount corruption in outsourced data. It uses RSA 
based Homomorphic authentication for auditing the cloud data and randomly sampling a few blocks of files. A 
Secon
d technique proposed by Juels as Proofs of retrievability (PoR) allows user to retrieve files without any 


owledge privacy, researcher [3] proposed Aggregatable Signature Based 
Broadcast (ASBB). It provides completeness, privacy and soundness. It uses 3 algorithms as Keygen, Gentag 
and Audit.

Using Virtual Machine
 
 
 
Abhishek Mohta proposed Virtual machines wh
ich uses RSA algorithm, for client data/file encryption and 
decryptions [5]. It also uses SHA 512 algorithm which makes message digest and check the data integrity. The 
Digital signature is used as an identity measure for client or data owner. It solves th
e problem of integrity, 
unauthorized access, privacy and consistency.

EXISTING
 
SYSTEM
 
 
The cloud data storage service contains 3 different entities as cloud user, Third party auditor & cloud server / 
cloud service provider. Cloud user is a person who stor
es large amount of data or files on a cloud server. Cloud 
server is a place where we are storing cloud data and that data will be managed by the cloud service provider. 
Third party auditors will do the auditing on users request for storage correctness and 
integrity of data. The 
proposed system specifies that user can access the data on a cloud as if the local one without worrying about the 
integrity of the data.
 
 
Fig.1 The Architecture of cloud data storage service.
 
 
Hence, TPA is used to check the integri
ty of data. It supports privacy preserving public auditing. It checks the 
integrity of the data, storage correctness. It also supports data dynamics & batch auditing. The major benefits of 
storing data on a cloud is the relief of burden for storage managem
ent, universal data access with location 
independent & avoidance of capital expenditure on hardware, software & personal maintenance. In cloud, data 
is stored in a centralized form and managing this data and providing security is a difficult task. TPA can 
read the 
contents of data owner hence can modify. The reliability is increased as data is handled by TPA but data 
integrity is not achieved. It uses encryption technique to encrypt the contents of the file. TPA checks the 
integrity of the data stored on a 


uses public key based homomorphic linear authentication (HLA) [1], [
2] which allows TPA to perform auditing 
without requesting for user data. It reduces communication & computation overhead. In this, HLA with random 
masking protocol is used which does not allow TPA to learn data content.

C. Batch Auditing
 
 
It also supports batch auditing through which efficiency is i
mproved. It allows TPA to perform multiple 
auditing task simultaneously and it reduces communication and computation cost. Through this scheme, we can 
identify invalid response. It uses bilinear signature (BLS proposed by Boneh, Lynn and Shacham) to achiev
e 
batch auditing. System performance will be faster.
 
 
D. Data Dynamics
 
 
It also supports data dynamics where user can frequently update the data stored on a cloud. It supports block 
level operation of insertion, deletion and modification. Author of [6] pro
posed scheme which support 
simultaneous public audability and data dynamics. It uses Merkle Hash Tree (MHT) which works only on 
encrypted data. It [11] uses MHT for block tag authentication.

Preserving Public Aud

I will utilize the Homomorphic Random Authenticator (HRA) by using ElGamal Public Key Encryption 
Algorithm and random masking to guarantee that the, TPA would not learn any knowledge about the dat
a 
content stored on the cloud server during the efficient auditing process, which not only eliminates the burden of 

outsourced data leakage. Cons
idering TPA may concurrently handle multiple audit sessions from different users 
for their outsourced data files, they further extend our privacy
-
preserving public auditing protocol into a 
multiuser setting, where the TPA can perform multiple auditing task
s in a batch manner for better efficiency. 
Extensive analysis shows that their schemes are provably secure and highly efficient. With random masking, the 
TPA no longer has all the necessary information to build up a correct group of linear equations and th
erefore 

 

 
The Third
-
Party Auditor:
 
 
TPA check the integrity of outsourced data and be worry free. TPA to perform audits for multiple users 
simultaneously and efficiently. TPA audit the outsourced data when needed. The T
PA, who has expertise and 
capabilities that users do not, can periodically check the integrity of all the data stored in the cloud on behalf of 
the users, which provides a much more easier and affordable way for the users to ensure their storage 
correctnes
s in the cloud. Moreover, in addition to help users to evaluate the risk of their subscribed cloud data 
services, the audit result from TPA would also be beneficial for the cloud service providers to improve their 
cloud
-
based service platform.
 
 

 
The ElGamal
 
Public Key Encryption Algorithm:
 
 
The security of ElGamal is based on the discrete logarithm problem. To encrypt and respectively 
decrypt a message, a discrete power is executed. This operation is e_cient to compute. An attacker that seeks to 
decrypt an i
ntercepted message may try to recover the private key. To this end a logarithm needs to be computed. 
No actual method exists for this, given certain requirements on the initial group are met. Under these 
circumstances, the encryption is secure. Today the E
lGamal algorithm is used in many cryptographic products. 
The open
-
source software GnuPG uses ElGamal as standard for signatures. On behalf of this software and its 
problems with ElGamal [10] discovered in late 2003 we will show the importance of correct im
plementation of 
cryptographic algorithms.
 
 
Thus ElGamal simplified the Difie
-
Hellman key exchange algorithm by introducing a random 
exponent k. This exponent is an replacement for the private exponent of the receiving entity. Due to this 
simplification the
 
algorithm can be used to encrypt in one direction, without the necessity of the second party to 
take actively part. The key advance here is that the algorithm can be used for encryption of electronic messages, 
which are transmitted by the means of public 
store
-
and
-
forward services.
 
 
The ElGamal Algorithm provides an alternative to the RSA for public key encryption.
 
1) Security of the RSA depends on the (presumed) difficulty of factoring large integers.
 
2) Security of the ElGamal algorithm depends on the (p
resumed) difficulty of computing discrete logs in a 
large prime modulus. 
 
 
ElGamal has the disadvantage that the ciphertext is twice as long as the plaintext.
 
It has the advantage the same plaintext gives a different ciphertext (with near certainty) each t
ime it is 
encrypted.
