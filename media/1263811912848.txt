  5.8.1 Introduction 
Bluetooth wireless technology is a 
short-range radio technology, which is developed for 
Personal Area Network (PAN). Bluetooth is
 a standard developed by a group of electronics manufacturers that 
allows any sort of electronic
 equipment -- from computers 
and cell phones to keyboards and headphones -- to make its own connections, without 
wires, cables or any direct action from a user. It is an ad hoc type network operable over a 

small area such as a room. Bluetooth wire
less technology makes it po
ssible to transmit 
signals over short distances between telephones, computers and other devices and thereby 
simplify communication and sync
hronization between devices. It is a global standard that: 
  Eeliminates wires and cables between 
both stationary and mobile devices 
 Facilitates both data and voice communication 
 Offers the possibility of ad hoc networks and delivers the ultimate 
synchronicity between all your personal devices  Bluetooth is a dynamic standard where de
vices can automatically find each other, 
establish connections, and discover what they can do for each other on an ad hoc basis. 
Bluetooth is intended to be a standard that works at two levels:  
  It provides agreement at the physical le
vel -- Bluetooth is a radio-frequency standard.   It also provides agreement at the next 
level up, where products have to agree on when bits are sent, how many will be sent
 at a time and how the parties in a 
conversation can be sure that the message
 received is the same as the message 
sent.  It is conceived initially by Ericsson, before being adopted by a myriad of other 
companies, Bluetooth is a standard for a 
small, cheap radio chip to be plugged into computers, printers, mobile phones, etc. A Bluetooth chip is designed to replace cables by taking the information normally carried by 
the cable, and transmitting it at a special 
frequency to a receiver Bluetooth chip, whic
h will then give the information received to 
the computer, phone whatever. 
  Version 2 CSE IIT, Kharagpur  5.8.2  Topology 
There are two types of topology for Bluetooth Œ Piconet, Scatternet. The Piconet  is a small ad hoc network of devices (normally 
8 stations) as shown in Fig. 5.8.1. It has the following features:  o One is called Master and the others are called 
Slaves
 o All slave stations synchronizes their clocks with the master 
o Possible communication - One-to-one or one-to-many
 o There may be one station in 
parked state o Each piconet has a unique hopping pattern/ID  o Each master 
can connect to 7 simultaneous or 200+ inactive (parked) slaves per piconet                             Figure 5.8.1 Piconet topology of Bluetooth   By making one slave as master of another Pi
conet, Scatternet is formed by combining 
several Piconets as shown in Fig. 5.8.2. Key 
features of the scatternet topology are mentioned below: 

 Ł A Scatternet is the 
linking of multiple 
co-located piconets through the sharing of common mast
er or slave devices. 
Ł A device can be both a master and a slave. Ł Radios are symmetric 
(same radio can be master or slave). 
Ł High capacity system, each piconet has maxi
mum capacity (720 Kbps)

The Bluetooth architecture, showing all the major layers in the Bluetooth system, are depicted in the Fig. 5.8.3. The layers below can be considered to be 
different hurdles in an obstacle course. This is because all the la
yers function one after the other. One layer comes into play only after the data ha
s been through the previous layer.     Application Framework and Support Link Manager and L2CAP Radio & Baseband Audio L2CAP Other

tion of the Bluetooth Link Controller (LC), which carries out the baseband protocols and other low-level link 
Version 2 CSE IIT, Kharagpur  routines. It specifies Piconet/Channel de
finition, ﬁLow-levelﬂ packet definition, 
Channel sharing   LMP: The Link Manager Protocol (LMP) is used by the Link Managers (on either side) for link set-up and control.   HCI: The Host Controller Interface 
(HCI) provides a command interface to the 
Baseband Link Controller and Link Manager, and access to hardware status and 
control registers. 
  L2CAP: Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol 
(L2CAP) supports higher level protocol multiplexing, packet segmentation and reassembly, and the 

conveying of quality of service information. 
 RFCOMM: The RFCOMM protocol provides emulation of serial ports over the L2CAP protocol. The protocol is based on the ETSI standard TS 07.10. 
 SDP: The Service Discovery Protocol (SDP) 
provides a means for applications to 
discover, which services are provided by or available through a Bluetooth device. It also allows applications to determin
e the characteristics of those available services. Now we shall be study each layer in detail (i
n next few sections) so that we come to 
know the function of each layer. 
 5.8.4 Bluetooth Layers 
5.8.4.1 Layer 1: Radio Layer This is the lowest layer in the Bluetooth pr
otocol stack. Bluetooth uses a technique called 
frequency hopping, as explained in the context of wireless LANs, in establishing radio 
links with other Bluetooth devices. Suppose we have a data packet then the whole packet is never transmitted at the same frequency. It
 is always split into different parts and 
transmitted at different frequencies. This
 is the frequency hopping technique (already discussed previously in Wireless LAN lesson). 
This partly gives the necessary protection to the transmitted data and avoids tampering. 
Standard hop values are 79 hops, which are 
spaced at an interval of 1 MHz. In some
 countries like France, due to government 
regulations 23 hops are used.   Transmitter characteristics: Each device is classified into 3 power classes, Power Class 
1, 2 & 3.   Power Class 1
: is designed for long range (~100m) devices, with a max output 
power of 20 dBm, 
 Power Class 2
: for ordinary range devices (~10m) devices, with a max output 
power of 4 dBm, 
Version 2 CSE IIT, Kharagpur   Power Class 3
: for short range devices (~10cm) devices, with a max output 
power of 0 dBm. 
 The Bluetooth radio interface is based on a nom
inal antenna power of 0dBm. Each device 
can optionally vary its transmitted power. 
Equipment with power control capability 
optimizes the output power in a link with 
LMP commands (see Link Manager Protocol). 
It is done by measuring RSSI 
and reporting it back, if the power is required to be 
increased or decreased. 
 
 
Modulation Characteristics: 
The Bluetooth radio module uses GFSK (Gaussian 
Frequency Shift Keying) where a binary one is represented by a positive frequency 

deviation and a binary zero by a negative frequency deviation. BT is set to 0.5 and the modulation index must be between 0.28 and 0.35. 
 Radio Frequency Tolerance: The transmitted initial center frequency accuracy must be 
±75 kHz from Fc. The initial frequency accu
racy is defined as being the frequency accuracy before any information is transmitted. Note that the frequency drift requirement 
is not included in the ±75 kHz. 

 
Receiver Characteristics: The receiver must have a sensitivity level for which the bit 
error rate (BER) 0.1% is met. For Bluetooth 
this means an actual sensitivity level of 
70dBm or better. 
5.8.4.2 Layer 2: Baseband Layer The baseband is the digital engine of a Bluetooth system. It is responsible for 
constructing and decoding packets, encoding and managing error correction, encrypting 
and decrypting for secure communications, 
calculating radio transmission frequency patterns, maintaining synchroni
zation, controlling the radio, and all of the other low level details necessary to realize Bluetooth communications.  Bluetooth operates in the 
2.4 GHz ISM band
. In the US and Europe, a band of 83.5 MHz width is available; in this band, 
79 RF channels spaced 1 MHz apart are 

defined. In France, a smaller band is availabl
e; in this band, 23 RF channels spaced 1 MHz part are defined. The channel is represented by a 
pseudo-random hopping sequence hopping through the 79 or 23 RF channels. Two or more Bluetooth devices using the same 
channel form a piconet. The hopping sequence is unique for the piconet and is determined by the Bluetooth device address (B
D_ADDR) of the master; the phase in the 
hopping sequence is determined by the Bluetooth clock of the master. The channel is 

divided into time slots where each slot corr
esponds to an RF hop frequency. Consecutive 
hops correspond to different RF hop frequencies. Figure 5.8.4 shows the communication 
between the master and a slave. In this case, the master uses  even numbered slots and the 
slave communicates in the odd numbered slots  in a half-duplex mode. 
Version 2 CSE IIT, Kharagpur   Figure 5.8.4 Master-slave communication     Figure 5.8.5 Master and multi-slave communication 
The data exchange takes place with every clock tick. Th
e clock synchronization is with respect to that of the master. Transm
ission takes place by way of TIME DIVISION 
DUPLEXING (TDD). The channel is divided into
 time slots, each 625 µs in length. The 
time slots are numbered according to the Blue
tooth clock of the piconet master. A TDD 
scheme is used where master and slave altern
atively transmit. The master shall start its 
transmission in even-numbered time slots onl
y, and the slave shall start its transmission 
in odd-numbered time slots only. 
The packet start shall be aligned with the slot start. Version 2 CSE IIT, Kharagpur  Always remember that the 'slave has to adjust 
itself to the whims of its master'. If a slave 
is to establish a connection with the master, then the sl
ave has to synchronize its own clock according to that of the master. In th
e multiple-slave scenario, the slave uses even 
numbered slots, but only one slave communicat
es in the next odd-numbered slot if the packet in the previous slot was addressed to it. This is shown in Fig. 5.8.5. The Baseband handles three types of links:    SCO (Synchronous Connection-Oriented): The SCO link is a symmetric point-
to-point link between a master and a si
ngle slave in the piconet. The master 

maintains the SCO link by using reserved slots at regular intervals (circuit 
switched type). The SCO link mainly carri
es voice information. The master can 
support up to three simultaneous SCO links 
while slaves can support two or three SCO links. SCO packets are never retran
smitted. SCO packets are used for 64 
kB/s speech transmission. 
 Polling-based (TDD) packet transmissions
: In this link type
 one slot is of 0.625msec (max 1600 slots/sec) and mast
er/slave slots (even-/odd-numbered 
slots)  ACL (Asynchronous Connection-Less) link
: The ACL link is a point-to-multipoint link between the master and all 
the slaves participating on the piconet. In the slots not reserved for the SCO li
nks, the master can establish an ACL link 
on a per-slot basis to any slave, including the slave already engaged in an SCO link (packet switched type). Only a single ACL link can exist. For most ACL packets, packet retransmission is applied. 
 Device Addressing: Four possible types of addresses can be assigned to bluetooth units.   BD_ADDR: Bluetooth Device Address : 
Each Bluetooth transceiver is allocated a unique 48-bit device address. It is divided into a 24-bit LAP field, a 16-bit NAP field and a 8-bit UAP field.  AM_ADDR: Active Member Address: It is a 3-bit number. 
It is only valid as long as the slave is active on the channel. It is also sometimes called the MAC 
address of a Bluetooth unit.  PM_ADDR: Parked Member Address: 
It is a 8-bit member (master-local) 
address that separates the parked slaves. The PM_ADDR is only valid as long as the slave is parked.  AR_ADDR: Access Request Address : 
This is used by the parked slave to 
determine the slave-to master
 half slot in the access window it is allowed to send access request messages in. It is only valid as long as the slave is parked and is 

not necessarily unique. 
5.8.4.3 Layer 3: Link Manager Protocol The Link Manager is responsible for mana
ging the physical details for Bluetooth connections. It is responsible for creating the links, monitoring their health, and Version 2 CSE IIT, Kharagpur  terminating them gracefully upon command or failure. The link manager is implemented 
in a mix of hardware and software. 

 
The Link Manager carries out link setup, authentication, link configuration and other protocols. It discovers other remote LM™s
 and communicates with them via the Link 
Manager Protocol (LMP). To perform its serv
ice provider role, the LM uses the services of the underlying Link Controller (LC). 

 
The Link Manager Protocol essentially consists of a number of PDU (protocol Data 
Units), which are sent from one device to 
another, determined by the AM_ADDR in 
the packet header. 

 5.8.4.4 Layer 4: Host Controller Interface This is the layer of the stack that contains 
the firmware i.e. the software that actually 
controls all the activities happening in the Baseband and Radio layers. It provides a common interface between the Bluetooth host 
and a Bluetooth module. It manages the 
hardware links with the scatternets. It also 
contains the drivers for the hardware devices 
used in the connection. Basically the 
BIOS is loaded in the HCI Layer. 
5.8.4.5 Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol The Logical Link Control and Adaptation Layer Protocol (L2CAP) is layered over the Baseband Protocol and resides in the data link layer.  The L2CAP is the big picture brains of a Bluetooth system. It manages the high level 
aspects of each connection (who is connected to who, whether to use encryption or not, 
what level of performance is required, etc.). 
In addition it is res
ponsible for converting 
the format of data as necessary between the 
APIs and the lower leve
l Bluetooth protocols. The L2CAP is implemented in software and can execute either on the host system 

processor or on a local processor in the Bluetooth system. L2CAP provides connection oriented and connectionless data services to upper layer protocols with protocol multiplexing capability, segmentation and rea
ssembly operation, and group abstractions. 
L2CAP permits higher-level protocols and applications to transmit and receive L2CAP 
data packets up to 64 kilobytes in length. Two link types are supported for the Baseband layer: Synchronous Connection-Oriented (SCO) links and Asynchronous Connection-Less (ACL) links. SCO links support real-
time voice traffic using reserved bandwidth. AC
L links support best effort traffic. The 
L2CAP Specification is defined for only AC
L links and no support for SCO links is 
planned.  5.8.4.6  Layer 6: Radio Frequency Communication (RFCOMM) This is the most important layer in the Bluetooth architecture. RFCOMM takes care of 

the communication channel between two devices
 or between a master and a slave. It 
connects the serial ports of all the devices according to the requirement. 
Version 2 CSE IIT, Kharagpur  RFCOMM basically has to accommodate two kinds of devices:  1. Communication end-points such as computers or printers. 
2. Devices that are a part of communication channel such as Modems. 
 RFCOMM protocol is not aware of the distinction between 
these two kinds of devices. Hence to prevent any loss of data, it passes on all the information to both the devices. The 

devices in turn distinguish between the data and filter it out. 
 5.8.4.7  Layer 7: Service Discovery Protocol The service discovery protocol (SDP) provi
des a means for applications to discover 
which services are available and to determ
ine the characteristics of those available 
services. 
 
A specific Service Discovery protocol is needed
 in the Bluetooth environment, as the set 
of services that are available changes dynami
cally based on the RF proximity of devices 
in motion, qualitatively different from servic
e discovery in traditional network-based environments. The service discovery protocol
 defined in the Bluetooth specification is intended to address the unique characteristics of the Bluetooth environment. 
 
Bluetooth is basically a universal protocol. Manufacturers may embed Bluetooth ports in 
their devices. SDP is very important when 
devices from different companies and from 
different parts of the world are brought together. The devices try to recognize each other 

through SDP. 
 
 5.6.4.8 Telephony Control Protocol Spec (TCS) Basic function of this layer is call control (setup & release) and group management for 
gateway serving multiple devices. 

 
 5.6.4.9 Application Program Interface (API) libraries 
These are software modules which connect the 
host application program to the Bluetooth 
communications system. As such they re
side and execute on the same processing 
resource as the host system application.
