  Lesson 1   Network Topology Version 2 CSE IIT, Kharagpur Specific Instructional Objectives  At the end of this lesson, the students will be able to: 
 Specify what is meant by network topology 
 Classify different Network topologies  Categorize various Network topologies  
 Explain the characteristics of the following topologies: o Mesh o Bus o Star o Ring o Tree o Unconstrained  5.1.1 Introduction
 Topology refers to the way in which the ne
twork of computers is connected. Each topology is suited to specific tasks and has its own advantages and disadvantages. The 
choice of topology is dependent upon type and number of eq
uipment being used, planned 
applications and rate of data transfer required, response time, and  cost. Topology can 
also be defined as the geometrically interc
onnection pattern by which the stations (nodes/computers) are connected using suitabl
e transmission media (which can be point-
to-point and broadcast). Various commonly used topologies are discussed in the 
following sections. 
 5.1.2 Mesh Topology 
In this topology each node or station is connect
ed to every other station as shown in Fig. 
5.1.1. The key characteristics of this topology are as follows:  
 
Key Characteristics: 
o Fully connected o Robust Œ Highly reliable o Not flexible 
o Poor expandability  
  Figure 5.1.1 Mesh Topology  
Two nodes are connected by dedicated point-point links between them. So the total number of links to conn
ect n nodes = n(n-1)/2; which is proportional to n2 . Media used 
for the connection (links) can be twisted pair, co-axial cable or optical fiber. With this 
topology there is no need to provide any additional information, that is from where the 
packet is coming, along with the packet because two nodes have a point-point dedicated 
Version 2 CSE IIT, Kharagpur link between them. And each node knows which 
link is connected to which node on the 
other end.   
Mesh Topology is not flexible and has a 
poor expandability as to add a new node n links have to be laid because that new node has to be connected to each of the existing 

nodes via dedicated link as shown in Fig. 
5.1.2. For the same reason the cost of 

cabling will be very high for a larger area. 
And due to these reasons this topology is 
rarely used in practice.

In Bus Topology, all stations attach through appropriate hardware in
terfacing known as a tap, directly to a linear transmission medium, or bus 
as shown in Fig. 5.1.3. Full-duplex 
operation between the station and the tap allows
 data to be transmitted onto the bus and 
received from the bus. A transmission from
 any station propagates the length of the medium in both directions and can be receive
d by all other stations. At each end of the 
bus there is a terminator, which absorbs any signal, preventing reflection of signal from the endpoints. If the terminator is not pres
ent, the endpoint acts like a mirror and reflects 
the signal back causing inte
rference and other problems.

 Figure 5.1.3 Bus Topology  
Key Characteristics of this topology are: o Flexible o Expandable o Moderate Reliability  
o Moderate performance 
A shared link is used between different stati
ons. Hence it is very cost effective. One 
can easily add any new node or delete any node without affecting other nodes; this makes this topology easily expandable. Because of th
e shared medium, it is necessary to provide 
Version 2 CSE IIT, Kharagpur some extra information about the desired de
stination, i.e. to ex
plicitly specify the 
destination in the packet, as compared to
 mesh topology. This is because the same 
medium is shared among many nodes. As 
each station has a unique address in the 
network, a station copies a packet only when the destination address of the packet 
matches with the self-address. This is how
 data communications 
take place among the 
stations on the bus.  As there are dedicated links in the mess topology, there is a possibility of 
transferring data in parallel. But in bus topology, only one station is allowed to send data at a time and all other stations listen to it, 
as it works in a broadcast mode. Hence, only 
one station can transfer the data at any given time. Suitable medium access control 
technique should be used so as to provide some way to decide ﬁwhoﬂ will go next to send 
data? Usually a distributed medium access cont
rol technique, as discussed in the next 
lesson, is used for this purpose. As the distance through which signal traverses increases, the attenuation 
increases. If the sender sends data (signal) with a small strength signal,
 the farthest station will not be able to receive the signal properl
y. While on the other hand if the transmitter 
sends the signal with a larger 
strength (more power) then the farthest station will get the 
signal properly but the station near to it ma
y face over-drive. Hence, delay and signal unbalancing will force a maximum length of shared medium, which can be used in bus 

topology. 
 5.1.4 STAR Topology 
In the star topology, each station is directly connected to a common central node as 
shown in Fig. 5.1.4. Typically, each station attaches to a central node, referred to as the star coupler, via two point-to-point links, one for transmission and one for reception.  

   
 
 
 
Key features: 
o High Speed o Very Flexible o High Reliability 
o High Maintainability 
Figure 5.1.4 Star Topology 
 
In general, there are two alternatives for the operation of the central node.  o One approach is for the central node to operate in a broadcast fashion. A 
transmission of a frame from one station to the node is retransmitted on all of the 
Version 2 CSE IIT, Kharagpur outgoing links. In this case, although the arrangement is physically a star, it is 
logically a bus; a transmission from any station is received by all other stations, 
and only one station at a time may successfu
lly transmit. In this case the central 
node acts as a repeater.  o Another approach is for the central node to act as a frame-switching device. An 
incoming frame is buffered in the node and then retransmitted on an outgoing link 

to the destination station. In this approach, the central node acts as a 
switch and 
performs the switching or routing f
unction. This mode of operation can be 
compared with the working of a telephone
 exchange, where the caller party is connected to a single called party and each pair of subscriber who needs to talk 

have a different connection.  Very High speeds of data transfer can be achieved by using star topology, particularly when the star coupler is used in the switch mode. This topology is the easiest to maintain, 
among the other topologies. As the number of 
links is proportional to n, this topology is very flexible and is the most preferred topology.   5.1.5 Ring topology 
In the ring topology, the network consists of a set of repeaters joined by point-to-point links in a closed loop as shown in Fig. 5.1.5. The repeater is a comparatively simple 
device, capable of receiving data on one link and transmitting them, bit by bit, on the 

other link as fast as they are received, with no buffering at the repeater. The links are 
unidirectional; that is data are transmitted in one
 direction only and all are oriented in the 
same way. Thus, data circulate around the 
ring in one direction (clockwise or 

counterclockwise).                               Figure 5.1.5 Ring Topology   Each station attaches to the network at 
a repeater and can tr
ansmit data onto the 
network through that repeater. 
As with the bus and tree, data are transmitted in frames. 
Version 2 CSE IIT, Kharagpur As a frame circulates past all the other st
ations, the destination station recognizes its 
address and copies the frame into a local 
buffer as it goes by. The frame continues to 
circulate until it returns to the source sta
tion, where it is removed. Because multiple 
stations share the ring, medium access control 
is needed to determine at what time each 
station may insert frames. 
How the source knows whether it has to transmit a new packet and whether the previous packet has been received properly by the destination or not. For this, the 
destination change a particular bit (bits) in 
the packet and when the receiver sees that packet with the changed bit, it comes to know
 that the receiver has received the packet. This topology is not very reliable, b
ecause when a link fails the entire ring 
connection is broken. But reliability can be improved by using wiring concentrator, which helps in bypassing a faulty node and somewhat is similar to star topology. 
 Repeater works in the following three modes:

: When the node is faulty then it 
can be bypassed using the repeater in bypass mode, i.e. the station doesn™t care about what data is transmitted 

through the network, as shown in Fig. 5.1.8. In this mode there is no delay 
introduced because of this repeater.

This topology can be considered as an extension to bus topology. It is commonly used in cascading equipments. For example, you have 
a repeater box with 8-port, as far as you have eight stations, this can be used in a normal fashion. But if you need to add more 
stations then you can connect two or more rep
eaters in a hierarchical format (tree format) 
and can add more stations. In the Fig. 5.1.9, R1 refers to repeater one and so on and each 

repeater is considered to have 8-ports.

  Figure 5.1.9 Tree Topology  This tree topology is very good in an organization as incremental expansion can 
be done in this way. Main features of this topology are scalability and flexibility. This is 

because, when the need arises for more sta
tions that can be accomplished easily without 

affecting the already established network. 
 5.1.7 Unconstrained Topology 
 All the topologies discussed so far are symmetric and constrained by well-defined 
interconnection pattern. However, sometimes no definite patte
rn is followed and nodes 
are interconnected in an arbitrary manner 
using point-to-point links as shown in Fig 5.1.10. Unconstrained topology allows a lot of configuration flexibility but suffers from the complex routing problem. Complex ro
uting involves unwanted overhead and delay.      R3R2 Version 2 CSE IIT, Kharagpur

 5.1.8 Combination of topology and transmission media Topology and transmission media are interrelate
d. For example, all the important criteria 
of a network such as reliability, expandability and performance depend on both the 
topology and the transmission media used in th
e network. As a consequence, these two 
aspects are interrelated. Let us have a look at the various transmission media, which are 
used for different topologies. 
  Twisted pair is suitable for use in star and ring topologies Œ Cat 3: voice grade UTP, data rate up to 10 Mbps Œ Cat 5: data grade UTP, data rate up to 100 Mbps  Coaxial cable is suitable for use in bus topology Œ Baseband coaxial cable supports data rates of 20 Mbps at distances up to 2 Km.
