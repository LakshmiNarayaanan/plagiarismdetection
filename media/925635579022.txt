Notre Dame Researchers Scoring a Win-Win with Novel Set of Concussion Diagnostic Tools
The potential impact on the health and well-being of individuals with brain injuries are numerous. These individuals might display a range of symptoms — such as headaches, depression, loss of memory and loss of brain function — that may persist for weeks or months. The effects of brain injuries are most devastating when they remain unrecognized for long periods of time.
Medical Imaging Technologies: Views to a Cure
Emerging imaging technologies are being used to improve the quality of images available for more accurate diagnoses and treatment, assess radiation dosing, and find causes and cures for a variety of diseases.
Network Biology: Computational Approaches for Understanding the Cell
The Complex Networks Lab develops novel computational methods for network analysis and uses them to study cellular functioning and molecular causes of disease from biological networks, in hope to suggest novel candidates for therapeutic intervention.
