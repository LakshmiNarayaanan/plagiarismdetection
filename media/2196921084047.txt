Mobile Systems
1/5/18
Mobile systems research focuses on the design and implementation
of next-generation systems for mobile devices. Research topics
include mobile data management, wireless networks, sensing systems,
static analysis and instrumentation for mobile apps, mobile image
and video analytics, and secure and low-power hardware for mobile
devices.
High Performance Computing and Computational Science
1/8/18
Focuses on efficient experimental and theoretical solutions to
problems on state-of-the-art computational systems consisting of
large numbers of computational elements, including clouds,
clusters, grids, networks-of-workstations, massively parallel
supercomputers, and GPU-based systems.  Efficient solutions
are developed to solve fundamental operations, as well as large
scientific problems that require expertise in computer science,
mathematics, and scientific or engineering disciplines.
Cyber-Physical Systems (Internet of Things)
1/5/18
Focuses on the interplay between multiple elements of cyber
technologies (such as sensing, computing, communications and
control), and physical systems or processes (including
infrastructures such as transportation and power) as well as human
factors.
Medical Applications and Bioinformatics
1/5/18
Focuses on developing highly efficient algorithms and techniques
for a wide range of problems (such as automatic analysis of
biomedical images, computer assisted diagnosis, treatment planning,
protein-protein interaction network analysis, protein structure
prediction, computational analysis and interpretation of Genomes,
evolutionary studies of Genomic ORFans, and spatial positioning
patterns of the cell nucleus) arising in smart hospital, smart
healthcare, precision medicine, genomics, proteomics, and
microarray analysis. Techniques used in this area are often from
algorithms, computational geometry, computer vision, machine
learning, data analytics, internet of things (IoT), and high
performance computing.
Distributed Systems and Networks
1/5/18
Research in networking and distributed systems focuses on
enabling communication of and orchestrating coordination of a large
number of computing nodes. It spans the areas of cloud computing,
big data computing, and wireless and mobile computing.
Computer Security and Information Assurance
1/5/18
Focuses on applied cryptography, authentication, threat
modeling, anomaly detection, wireless security, cloud security,
human-centered security, differential privacy and empirical cyber
security.
Hardware and Architecture
1/8/18
Hardware and software issues from the circuit to the system have
three main foci: Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) circuits and
systems, computer architecture, and computer security.
Programming Languages and Software Systems
1/5/18
Programmming Language research focuses on type systems, program
logics, language-based and differential privacy and security;
language, compiler, and run-time design for reliable systems;
static and dynamic analyses for real-time Android; run-time
visualization and verification; adaptive memory management;
language concepts for database programming; logic- and
constraint-based systems.
Data Mining and Data Science
1/5/18
Algorithms for data mining have a close relationship to methods
of pattern recognition and machine learning.
Theory and Algorithms
6/28/17
Complexity theory is a mathematical discipline that classifies
computational problems by relative difficulty and measures the
computational resources needed to solve them.
Computing Education
1/4/18
Focuses on expanding approaches to teaching computing at all
levels (K-12 and University) and the outreach to promote computing
majors and careers. Addressing retention, diversity, and
persistence in computing through educational approaches are
targeted. Overall, the objective is developing a skilled and
diverse workforce in computing for the future.
Databases and Information Retrieval
1/4/18
Focuses on developing fundamental techniques, prototype systems
and applications in databases and information retrieval.
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
1/5/18
Artificial Intelligence (AI) researchers now predict that
computers will be able to perform tasks that were once considered
the prerogative of human beings.  They include tasks such as
driving trucks,  translating languages, writing high school
essays, creating art, analyzing forensic evidence, and even work as
a surgeon.  Although some of these goals are predicted to
happen over several decades, AI is concerned with  principles
and algorithms that allow researchers to make such bold
predictions.  Current methods focus on variants of deep
learning-- such as convolutional nets, recurrent nets, autoencoders
and adversarial networks-- as well as on the methods of
probabilistic graphical models.
