Such noise is usually captured by intrusion detection systems. Therefore, malware-free intrusions which generate little noise if any at all, are especially attractive to APT actors because they covertly use normal applications making it hard for intrusion detection systems. In this paper, we consider malware-free intrusions by formulating representations of system security states using Boolean logic in the scenario of a backdoor attack utilizing system implementation of pre-authentication services. We further derive, from the generated attack scenarios, a Bayesian security assessment model based on the environmental parameters of the experimental test-bed based on the backdoor attack via RDP-based remote access. The malware-free intrusion based on RDP backdoor attack is successfully run on five different versions of operating systems.View4 ReadsExpand abstractNew kind of delegation-based anonymous authentication scheme for wireless roaming networksArticleMar 2018C.-L. JiangS.-L. WuK. GuIn order to reduce message ows of traditional anonymous authentication schemes, a new kind of delegationbased scheme is proposed for wireless roaming networks. By making use of a proxy signature, the new scheme requires only a user and a visited server to participate in the authentication process, without the real-time participation of user's home server. Therefore, the new scheme needs less message ows than traditional schemes. In an instantiation of the new scheme, elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) is used to keep efficiency, and the mobile station needs only 3.25 elliptic curve scalar multiplication (ECSM) operations, which are 5.5ECSM and 3Pairing less than the scheme based on group signature. The comparison shows that, though the unlinkability of our scheme is weaker, the computation load is much lower. So our scheme is efficient and practical.View4 ReadsExpand abstractDetection of impersonation attack in MANET using polynomial reduction algorithmArticleMar 2018P.R. KavithaR. MukeshSecure routing among multiple routers become a complex process in Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks (MANETs) due to the presence of adversary nodes. An adversary node which compromises the honest node as well as it will use all secrets of compromised node. By these capabilities, the attacker launches impersonation attacks against secure transmission. Strengthening the personal key and monitoring the behavior of each node is crucial avoid impersonation attack. This paper proposed the Enhancing Polynomial reduction algorithm for Secure routing against Impersonation in Clustered MANET to tackle above secure routing issues. To provide the personal key with less key storage overhead, the clusters network based on the exible weight clustering algorithm. To avert impersonation, the polynomial reduction algorithm which initially exploits the strong key authentication via two separate transactions which forward the set of primitive polynomial with key function and the same with anyone random number in a successive manner. Also, the polynomial reduction algorithm considers the acknowledgments with attached hop-counts from the intermediate routers to identify the impersonation when the attacker acts as an intermediate router resulting in high control overhead. Therefore, the proposed introduces the Energy Efficient Polynomial Reduction (EPR) algorithm that reduces the overhead by sending the consolidated acknowledgment for same cluster nodes.View1 ReadExpand abstractA secure and effcient mutual authentication and key agreement protocol with smart cards for wireless communicationsArticleMar 2018C. GuoC.-C. ChangS.-C. ChangMobile user authentication and key agreement for wireless networks is an important security priority. In recent years, several user authentication and key agreement protocols with smart cards for wireless communications have been proposed. In 2011, Xu et al. proposed an effcient mutual authentication and key agreement protocol with an anonymity property. Although the protocol of Xu et al. has many benefits, we find that it still suffers from several weaknesses which have been previously overlooked. In this paper, we propose a secure and effcient mutual authentication and key agreement protocol. Confidentiality of the session key and updating of the password effciently are presented as the main contributions of this paper. Finally, evaluations of our proposed protocol show that our protocol can withstand various known types of attacks, and also satisfies essential functionality requirements. Additionally, effciency analyses show that our protocol is simple and cost-effcient.View2 ReadsExpand abstractNew Generic Design to Expedite Asymmetric Cryptosystems Using Three-levels of ParallelismArticleMar 2018Ghada F. El-KabbanyPublic key cryptosystems depend on complex and time
consuming arithmetic operations. Public key cryptosys-
tems require modular operations over large numbers or
�nite �elds. Researchers are working on improving the
performance of asymmetric cryptosystems while main-
taining the security of the cryptographic algorithms. Par-
allel computing is the most promising solution to im-
prove the computing power and speed-up these arithmetic
operations. In this paper, we propose a generic model
to execute any encryption algorithm through a parallel-
pipelined design. The proposed design is twofold. First,
we make use of a number of processors to execute dif-
ferent encryption/decryption steps in parallel. Secondly,
complex arithmetic operations could be divided into small
simple arithmetic operations that are executed in paral-
lel. Simulation experiments show that parallel implemen-
tations of the aggregated signcryption protocol (as a case
study) outperforms the sequential performance. The av-
erage values of improvement ranges from 47.5% to 80.4%
for di�erent number of processors.View4 ReadsExpand abstractA secure group signature schemeArticleMar 2018C.-Y. TsaiP.-F. HoM.-S. HwangGroup signature scheme could be applied to the valid members to represent the group. The validity of the signature could be verified by the receiver. On the other hand, the member who signs the message could not be found. However, the group manager could reveal and identify the signer if it is necessary. Concerning with a high performance on security, a new group signature scheme based on a discrete logarithm problem to achieve the characteristics of group signatures is proposed. With this proposed scheme, the signature could be generated rapidly. Also, the verification procedure of the group signature could be spent in a short time. This group signature scheme can protect important messages. Compare with other schemes, the proposed scheme is more secure and efficient than others. The analysis of the security and the performance evaluation of the proposed scheme are provided. The proposed group signature scheme could be suitable for e-commerce applications.ViewExpand abstractGeneralize estimating the ϕ(n) of upper/lower bound to RSA public key cryptosystemArticleMar 2018J.

This paper analyses the power consumption of both security software and web server software and concludes that traditional architectures waste energy with repeated transitions up and down the TCP/IP stack. This contention is proved by comparing the energy usage of a traditional architecture and a new architecture whereby IDS functionality is moved into the web server and all operations share HTTP packets. Based on these findings we propose a novel alternative power effcient architecture for web servers that may also be usable in other network systems.View1 ReadExpand abstractHKDS: A hierarchical key distribution scheme for wireless ad hoc networkArticleMar 2018K. ChatterjeeL. PriyaWireless ad hoc networks are very popular in many areas such as border area protection, rescue operations etc. These networks suffer security problems due to their infrastructure less architecture. Attacks like passive eavesdropping, impersonation, replay etc. can be easily performed in such networks. Also the devices used in such networks are mostly resource constrained devices. Hence highly secured complex cryptographic algorithm cannot implement in such devices. This paper proposes a two level hierarchical key distribution scheme (HKDS) for wireless ad hoc networks. In the first level the secret key is distributed among the cluster heads using knapsack algorithm. In the second level, the secret shares generated by cluster head using Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) scheme is distributed among the nodes of the cluster. After that a mutual authentication scheme is introduced through which the node and the cluster head will mutually authenticate themselves and generate the secret session key for communication.View3 ReadsExpand abstractDefeating cyber attacks due to script injectionArticleMar 2018D. DasD.K. BhattacharyyaOffensive operations have been promoted by the aggressors using computer as a tool or target, resulting, a cyber attack in web-applications of an organization or the infrastructure of entire nation. Depending upon the attacker's target, one can classify some of the mostly occurred cyber attacks into five broad categories. It reports some of the common methods adopted in conducting these attacks and their defending techniques. This paper mainly address the possibility of cyber attacks due to the execution of malicious or unintended nature of scripts. It formulates a veridication method of web document and perform experiment in the client-side using its benign script structure. This method is capable of detecting any malicious script which inserts in the web-document during transportation from server to the client or due to the previously stored content in the client or server operation. Satisfactory results have been found with the own-generated and publicly available data-set.View1 ReadExpand abstractCryptanalysis of design and analysis of a provably secure multi-server authentication schemeArticleMar 2018N.B.M. MohanA. S. N. ChakravarthyC. RavindranathThe rapid growth of inter-networking and communication technologies resulted in an exponential hit rate on commercial service providing websites (servers) like Google, Amazon, Flipkart etc. from remote users connected via Internet. To handle the networking load, the organizations are moving from the traditional two tier client server architecture to multi-server architecture for efficient load balancing. The traditional two-party authentication protocol for remote user authentication are not sufficient to break the ever increasing attacks on open network i.e. Internet. Also, the existing two-party authentication protocols are meant for single server, adopting these protocols for multi-server environment results in the requirement of huge computation cost for separate registration of user at each server. So, researchers started proposing authentication schemes specific to multi-server environment. In 2014, Yeh et al. proposed an improved version over Pippal et al.'s scheme which eliminates all identified weaknesses like susceptible to user impersonation attack, server counterfeit attack, and the man-in-the-middle attack. In 2015, Mishra et al. demonstrated that Yeh et al. scheme is susceptible to off-line password guessing attack, insider attack and user impersonation attack and proposed an improved version. In this manuscript we do a thorough analysis on Mishra et al. scheme and determine that Mishra et al. scheme is liable to 'known session specidic temporary information' attack and based on that, the attacker can realize all key attacks. We also demonstrate that Mishra et al. scheme consists of major inconsistencies like 'inefficient login phase' which restrict the protocol to adopt to real time implementation.View12 ReadsExpand abstractRobust speech perception hashing authentication algorithm based on spectral subtraction and multi-feature tensorArticleMar 2018Y.-B. HuangZhang Qiu-yuW.-J. HuIn order to make the speech perception hashing authentication algorithm has strong robustness and discrimination to content preserving operations and speech communication under the common background noise, a new robust speech perceptual hashing authentication algorithm based on spectral subtraction and multi-feature tensor was proposed. The proposed algorithm uses spectral subtraction method to denoise the speech which processed by applying pre-processing. Then, the algorithm acquires each speech component wavelet packet decomposition, MFCC and LPCC feature of each speech component are extracted to constitute the speech feature tensor. The feature tensor is decomposed tensor decomposition to reduce the complexity. Finally, speech authentication is done by generating the hashing values which use mid-value. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can denoise the speech effectively, and have good robustness and discrimination to content preserving operations, as well as able to resist the attack of the background noise, which is commonly heard during the communication.View1 ReadExpand abstractDesign of an AES device as device under test in a DPA attackArticleMar 2018Septafiansyah Dwi PutraMa'muriSutikno Sarwono[...]A.S. AhmadThis paper presents a design for the implementation of the AES encryption algorithm in the hardware system.

The platform used in this device is FPGA-Cyclone IV EP4CE115F29C7. AESAVS is used to test the functionality of the device. This study proposes a design for an AES-128 encryption device synthesized in the Quartus IDE. It will feature support conducting side-channel attacks on real condition.View5 ReadsExpand abstractNew generic design to expedite asymmetric cryptosystems using three-levels of parallelismArticleMar 2018Mohamed RasslanGhada ElkabbanyHeba K.

DeshpandeR. IngleWith growing acceptance of cloud environment, demand for cloud services based applications is rapidly increasing. Cloud environment is inherently distributed and highly dynamic. Usually, many cloud services having similar functionalities but varying performances are offered. This makes diffcult for user to identify the appropriate cloud service. Consequently, trust assessment is becoming essential to locate and to continue using the suitable cloud service. Quality of Service (QoS) attributes are significant for trust assessment in cloud environment. These attributes are dynamically changing and are not considered by the traditional trust assessment approaches. Hence, these approaches are inadequate to withstand in cloud environment. This paper proposes an evidence based trust estimation model (EBTEM) for trust assessment of cloud services. EBTEM uses various attributes of cloud service as evidence factors. It performs adaptive trust computation, which is sensitive to changes in the service behavior. EBTEM also presents a method for dynamic trust prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other models in respect of accuracy and effciency.View6 ReadsExpand abstractA new remote authentication scheme for anonymous users using elliptic curves cryptosystemArticleMar 2018X. ZhangB. WangW. WangAlong with the large-scale proliferation of network and information technology, users can obtain the information resources conveniently via intelligent device. Authentication mechanism is a fundamental tool for ensuring secure communications and the validity of communicating party. In this paper, we propose a new authentication scheme for anonymous users using elliptic curves cryptosystem (ECC) which achieves mutual authentication and forward security. Specifically, we certify the validity of our proposal by employing BAN-logic, which is one of the important formal methods. Further, the performance comparison shows that our scheme is more suitable for application scenarios where efficiency and security concerned.View1 ReadExpand abstractSecure and effcient authentication protocol for power system computer networksArticleMar 2018C.

The numerical analysis and simulation results shows that APP is more effcient than TLS, a public-key based authentication protocol recommended by IEC61850.View6 ReadsExpand abstractA survey to design privacy preserving protocol using chaos cryptographyArticleMar 2018H. ZhuR. WangChaos theory has been widely studied and adapted in cryptography for achieving some security mechanisms, such as encryption/decryption, key agreement and hash function. The privacy of using chaos cryptography mostly relies on one of or the combination of three mechanisms: (1) Universal construction symmetric cryptography; (2) Effcient type multiplication in finite field; (3) Prudent operation XORed. This paper introduces four effcient generic methods based on three mechanisms for protecting privacy. Our four methods firstly achieve encrypted messages with mutual authentication in one-way ow. In addition, we discuss some methods about using more than two of the methods to form hybrid cases. Finally, implementation analysis, formal proof and effciency comparison are provided to show that these mechanisms are practical, secure, and privacy preserving.ViewExpand abstractTraffic characteristic map-based intrusion detection model for industrial internetArticleMar 2018R.-H. DongD.-F. WuZhang Qiu-yuT. ZhangAfter the Stuxnet security event in Iran, the security issues on industrial Internet are very serious. Besides, there are many aws existing in the modern traffic modelling approaches to the industrial field network. Aiming at these problems, the traffic characteristic map-based intrusion detection model for industrial Internet was proposed. Firstly, information entropy method was adopted to select vital traffic characteristics attributes set which is used to form traffic characteristic vectors. Secondly, multiple correlation analysis approach was applied to transform traffic characteristics vector into triangle area mapping matrix and traffic characteristic map can be established. Finally, using discrete cosine transform (DCT) and singular value decomposition (SVD) methods, perceptual hash digest database of normal and abnormal traffic characteristics maps was obtained. Thereafter, the corresponding intrusion detection rule set can be generated, which is essential for the modelling of network traffic periodic characteristics in industrial field network. In particular, the robustness and discrimination of the traffic characteristics map perceptual hash algorithm (TCM-PH) were proved. Experimental results show that the proposed approach has a good performance of intrusion detection in the industrial field network.View6 ReadsExpand abstractCertificate-based smooth projective hashing and its applicationsArticleMar 2018S. LiY. MuM. ZhangSmooth projective hashing was firstly introduced by Cramer and Shoup (EuroCrypt'02) as a tool to construct efficient chosen-ciphertext-secure public key encryption schemes. Since then, they have found many other applications, such as password-based authenticated key exchange, oblivious transfer, zero-knowledge arguments et al. Certificate-based encryption (CBE) not only eliminates third-party queries and heavy certificate management problem in traditional public-key encryption, but also solves key escrow problem for identity-based encryption. We introduce the new concept of certificate-based smooth projective hashing (CB-SPH). Under the security model for the leakage-resilient certificate-based encryption (LR-CBE), we show how to construct a general leakage-resilient certificate-based encryption scheme using the certificate-based smooth projective hashing. Based on these theoretical constructions, we present two concrete CB-SPH instantiations under the DBDH assumption and the DLWE assumption respectively. Based on these CB-SPH instantiations, we can construct leakage resilient CBE schemes.View2 ReadsExpand abstractA study of non-abelian public key cryptographyArticleMar 2018T.-C. LinNonabelian group-based public key cryptography is a relatively new and exciting research field. Rapidly increasing computing power and the futurity quantum computers [52] that have since led to, the security of public key cryptosystems in use today, will be questioned. Research in new cryptographic methods is also imperative. Research on nonabelian group-based cryptosystems will become one of contemporary research priorities. Many innovative ideas for them have been presented for the past two decades, and many corresponding problems remain to be resolved. The purpose of this paper, is to present a survey of the nonabelian group-based public key cryptosystems with the corresponding problems of security. We hope that readers can grasp the trend that is examined in this study.View6 ReadsExpand abstractA secure ECC-based mobile RFID mutual authentication protocol and its applicationArticleMar 2018S.-Y. ChiouW.-T. KoE.-H. LuMobile RFID applications combine RFID technologies and mobile device to create a new convenient application area. However, most of the applications suffer from the security issues due to insecure communication channels among tags, readers and servers. In 2012, Zhou et al. proposed an ECC-based mutual authentication protocol to promote mobile RFID applications security. However, we found their protocol faces to OTRUTS (one time reading and unlimited times service) problem, which means once a reader read the data of a certain tags from a server successfully, the reader can read it unlimited times without reading those tags again. Therefore, their protocol cannot securely support some mobile RFID applications such as the security patrolling application. In this paper, we propose a new secure ECC-based mobile RFID mutual authentication protocol for the safety of mobile RFID applications such as security patrolling.View8 ReadsExpand abstractAdaptively-Secure Authenticated Key Exchange Protocol in Standard ModelArticleJan 2018Mojahed Ismail MohamedXiaofen WangXiaosong ZhangDesign a Secure Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) protocol is a wide research area. Many works have been done in this field and remain few open problems. Design an AKE-secure without NAXOS approach is remaining as an open problem. NAXOS approach [18] is used to hide the ephemeral secret key from an adversary even if the adversary in somehow may obtain the ephemeral secret key. Using NAXOS approach will cause two main drawbacks, (1) leaking of the static secret key which will be used in computing the exponent of the ephemeral public key. (2) Maximize of using random oracle when applying to the exponent of the ephemeral public key and session key derivation. Another open problem is designing an AKE-secure in the standard model without relying on Pseudo-Random Function with Pairwise-Independent Random Sources. In this paper, we present a general construction for AKE-secure protocol from the projective hash family secures under hard subset membership problem in the standard model. We also give an instantiation of our protocol from DDH with a novel security proof from games sequences tool introduced by [24]. We show the effciency of our protocol compares to other similar AKE protocol.View14 ReadsExpand abstractIsogeny-based Quantum-resistant Undeniable Blind Signature SchemeArticleJan 2018M.S. SrinathVenkatachalam ChandrasekaranIn this paper, we propose an Undeniable Blind Signature scheme (UBSS) based on isogenies between supersingular elliptic curves. The proposed UBSS is an extension of the Jao-Soukharev undeniable signature scheme [16]. We formalize the notion of a UBSS by giving the formal definition. We then study its properties along with the pros and cons. Based on this, we provide a couple of its applications. We then state the isogeny problems in a more general form and discuss their computational hardnesses. Finally, we prove that the proposed scheme is secure in the presence of a quantum adversary under certain assumptions.View7 Reads3 CitationsExpand abstractA new approach to quantify network security by ranking of security metrics and considering their relationshipsArticleJan 2018M. BehiM. GhasemiGolHamed Vahdat NejadThere are several characteristics in computer networks, which play important roles in determining the level of network security. These characteristics known as security metrics can be applied for security quantification in computer networks. Most of the researches on this area has focused on defining the new security metrics to improve the quantification process. In this paper, we present a new approach to analyze and quantify the network security by ranking of security metrics with considering the relationships between them. Our ranking method reveals the importance of each security metric to quantify security in the network under surveillance. The proposed approach helps the network administrators to have a better insight on the level of network security.View7 ReadsExpand abstractNew protocol E-DNSSEC to enhance DNSSEC securityArticleJan 2018Kaouthar ChetiouiG. OrhanouSaid El HajjiThe Domain Name System (DNS) is an essential component of the internet infrastructure. Due to its importance, securing DNS becomes a necessity for current and future networks. DNSSEC, the extended version of DNS has been developed in order to provide security services. Un- fortunately, DNSSEC doesn't order query privacy; we can see all queries sent to resolver in clear. In this paper, we evaluate the security of DNS and DNSSEC protocols, and we would see clearly that DNSSEC is insufficient to secure DNS protocol; it doesn't ensure confidentiality to data transiting over the network. That's why, we propose a new method named 'E-DNSSEC' which aims to add, in addition to DNSSEC security features, queries confidentiality, by encrypting them between DNSSEC servers. After that, an implementation of E-DNSSEC protocol will be given. Finally, we conclude by an analysis to prove the positive impact of this method to enhance DNSSEC security.View1 Read1 CitationExpand abstractArray erasure codes with preset fault tolerance capabilityArticleJan 2018D. TangY.-Q. WangH.-P. YangThe array erasure code, an ideal method for fault tolerance in storage systems, however, is obstructed by its impossibility to set the fault tolerant ability according to dynamic application environment for practical purpose. In view of this, this paper presents a new class of array erasure codes, with the greatest contribution to the array codes which can be obtained according to the preset num- ber of fault tolerance and storage efficiency in dynamic structure, and fault tolerance capability can be presented is not limited in theory. In addition, the new array code has the advantages of simple structure, easy to realize, with no strong constraints to satisfy in structure. Only binary XOR operations are required for coding and decoding for a high operational efficiency, and fixed update penalty and repair cost which will not increase with the expansion of system size or increase of fault tolerance capability.View3 ReadsExpand abstractAn improved ownership transfer for RFID protocolArticleJan 2018R. XieB.-Y. JianD.-W. LiuThe ownership transfer problems occur during using the RFID tag. In view of the problems of the RFID tag own- ership transfer protocol, such as security defects and high computational cost, an improved lightweight RFID tag ownership transfer protocol is proposed in this paper. The improved protocol does not depend on the trusted third party, so that the improved protocol has a wider application space. Using the challenge-response mechanism, the new owner of the tag introduces the counter count and performs the corresponding operation according to the value of count to solve the desynchronization attack problems. The analysis results show that the improved protocol not only satisfies the security requirements of the tag transfer, but also overcomes the security defects of desynchronization attack. Compared with the existing RFID tag ownership transfer protocols, this improved protocol has larger promotion in the aspect of security and efficiency.View1 CitationExpand abstractDynamic Ant Colony System with Three Level Update Feature Selection for Intrusion DetectionArticleJan 2018H.M. RaisT. MehmoodThe current era is known as the age of digital information and general medium of access to this information is computer networks. The uses of network technology also make information insecure. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has been proven effective against such attacks. The anomaly-based detection method is good to detect new attacks. One of the foremost shortcomings in the anomalybased detection is the irrelevant and redundant features to the classification algorithm that results in low detection rate. Therefore, the primary objective of the feature selection process is to enhance the classification accuracy by removing redundant and irrelevant features. In this research a new feature selection algorithm called, Dynamic Ant Colony System with Three Level Update Feature Selection, has been proposed. The proposed method uses a different level of pheromones that help ants to find the robust features. The method also utilizes the information of each individual ant during feature selection process and incorporates the accuracy of the classification algorithms. Results showed that proposed feature selection algorithm outperformed compared to the previous feature selection algorithms.View4 ReadsExpand abstractAn effcient confidentiality preserving scheme using certificateless encryption with high trust levelArticleJan 2018R.

This encryption scheme achieves Girault's trust Level 3 as in traditional public key infrastructure based cryptography, and which is proved to be secure in the random oracle model under the hardness assumption of computational Diffe-Hellman problem. Compared with the related schemes, the performance analysis and simulation show that our scheme is more effcient than others.

ChengTrust is a useful model for the interactions of Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) in Vehicular Cyber-Physical System (VCPS). Given a dynamic nature in transportation, traditional static trust models cannot effectively create the trust relationship among moving vehicles, and cannot handle quickly and dynamically the frequent vehicular interactions in a network topology. A novel trust model of VANET in VCPS is proposed to theorize the trust relationship in the dynamic traffic environment and perform a verification through an improved trust chain and some trusted computing theories. This trust model developed can improve the vehicular interaction security and the driving safety and resist malicious attacks and deceptions. Another, the vehicular trustworthiness is evaluated for the trust model development. The simulation experimental results show that the proposed trust model has a better performance for transportation applications than traditional models.View2 ReadsExpand abstractCost analysis for classification-based autonomous response systemsArticleJan 2018Yudha PurwantoKuspriyantoTemmy HendrawanBudi RahardjoRecently, cost-based Autonomous Response System (ARS) proposals are based on intrusion detection analy- sis. However, the implementation of the analysis in multi- class classification-based ARS potentially leads to a wrong response action set decision. This is because the analysis may produces irrelevant response value, as it is not consid- ering the false possibility in a true positive condition. In this paper, we introduce ARS based on cost analysis from a multi-class classification output. The analysis is not only considering the possibility of a right response, but also the possibility of a wrong response from false classi- fication prediction. The response value and expected lost rate are introduced to quantitatively estimate the best response action set. Our simulation for Denial of Service (DoS) attack cases, confirmed the capability of response action set decision algorithm. Our proposed system pro- vides more accurate estimation of response value which leads to lower expected lost rate.View10 ReadsExpand abstractA secure and efficient image encryption algorithm based on DNA coding and spatiotemporal chaosArticleJan 2018X. LiC. ZhouN. XuIn this paper, an image encryption algorithm based on DNA random coding and random operation combined with chaotic map is proposed. In order to produce se- quences with more chaotic characteristics, a new spa- tiotemporal chaotic system is proposed by employing the Tent-Sine system (TSS) in the coupled map lattice (CML). SHA-256 hash of the plain image is used to gen- erate secret keys. The Lorenz Map, Logistic Map and TSS are applied to generate all parameters the proposed algorithm needs. In order to get the high randomness and overcome the limitations of DNA computing rules, encode the every rows of original image and key image with DNA rules respectively, which are randomly selected from eight encoding rules. Then, apply encoded original image to ex- ecute DNA operations with encoded key image row by row to obtain the transitional image and the one of the four DNA operations of every row is determined by logistic map; Finally, randomly decode the transitional image to gain the eventual encrypted image. experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm have ability to resist typical attacks.View5 ReadsExpand abstractNew intrusion detection system based on support vector domain description with information gain metricArticleJan 2018Mohamed El BoujnouniM. JedraWith the vulgarization of Internet, the easy access to its resources and the rapid growth in the number of com- puters and networks, the security of information systems has become a crucial topic of research and development especially in the field of intrusion detection. Techniques such as machine learning and data mining are widely used in anomaly-detection schemes to decide whether or not a malicious activity is taking place on a network. This paper presents a new intrusion detection system (IDS) based on information gain criterion to select relevant features from network traffic records and a new version of support vector domain description to classify the extracted features and to detect new intrusions.

QKD commences when sender transforms bits into qubits or quantum states by applying photon polarization and sends to the receiver. The qubits are altered when measured in incorrect polarization and cannot be reproduced according to quantum mechanics principles. BB84 protocol is the primary QKD protocol announced in 1984. This paper introduces a new regime of secure QKD using Hadamard quantum gate named as PVK16 QKD protocol. Applying quantum gate to QKD makes tangle to the eavesdroppers to measure the qubits. For a given length of key, it is shown that the error rate is negligible. Also, the authentication procedure using digital certificates prior to QKD is being performed which confers assurance that the communicating entities are legitimate users. It is used as a defensive mechanism on man in the middle attack.View1 ReadExpand abstractGeneralized PVO-K embedding technique for reversible data hidingArticleJan 2018J.-J. LiY.-H. WuC.-F. LeeC.-C. ChangRecently, several reversible information hiding methods based PVO (pixel value ordering) techniques have been proposed, in these methods, secret data always are embedded in pixels with largest or smallest value in the block. In order to make use of the block with multiple largest-valued (or smallest-valued) pixels, a PVO-K method was proposed, which treats K largest-valued (or smallest-valued) pixels as a unit to embed secret data, and all K pixels are modified together to embed one bit of information. In this paper, we propose a generalized PVO-K method (GePVO-K) that takes full advantage of these pixels with largest or smallest values by embedding K bits of secret data into the K pixels. As a result, the GePVO-K method has greater embedding capacity than the PVO-K method. The superiority of the GePVO-K scheme was verified by the experimental results.ViewExpand abstractAchieving collaborative cloud data storage by Key-Escrow-Free Multi-Authority CP-ABE scheme with Dual-RevocationArticleJan 2018N. VaanchigH. XiongW. ChenZ. QinNowadays, more and more users store their data in cloud storage servers for great convenience and real benefits offered by the service, so cloud data storage becomes one of the desirable services provided by cloud service providers. Multi-Authority Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (MA-CP-ABE) is an emerging cryptographic solution to data access control for large-scale collaborative cloud storage service, which allows any data owner to outsource the data to cloud data storage in order to enable users from collaborating domains or organizations to access the outsourced data. However, the existing MA-CPABE schemes cannot be directly applied to collaborative cloud storage services as data access control due to the key escrow problem and the absence of dual revocation mechanism (user revocation and attribute revocation). By addressing these issues, this paper presents a Key-Escrow- Free Multi-Authority Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption Scheme with Dual-Revocation by introducing "the essential attribute" and making use of a certificate authority apart from attribute authorities. Compared with the existing MA-CP-ABE schemes, the proposed scheme is the most suitable one to enable data access control for collaborative cloud storage systems. Furthermore, the security and performance analysis indicates that our scheme is more secure and reasonably efficient to be applied to practical scenarios as collaborative cloud storage systems.View8 ReadsExpand abstractMutual information-based intrusion detection model for industrial InternetArticleJan 2018R.-H. DongD.-F. WuZhang Qiu-yuH.-X. DuanHigh dimension, redundancy attributes and high computing cost issues usually exist in the industrial Internet intrusion detection field. For solving these problems, the mutual information-based intrusion detection model for industrial Internet was proposed. Firstly, by using features selection method based on mutual information, the attributes set was reduced and traffic characteristics vector was established. Secondly, the normal and abnormal traffic characteristics maps were obtained via the traffic characteristics map technology based on multi correlation analysis. Finally, with the using of discrete cosine transform and nonnegative matrix factorization, we can produce normal and abnormal hash digest, which were used to produce intrusion detection rules. To verify the effectiveness of this model, we adopt NSL-KDD data as the experimental data. The experimental results show that, by using the features selection approach based on mutual information, the proposed model has good classification accuracy and gets good detection performance.View2 ReadsExpand abstractA survey of reversible data hiding for VQ-compressed imagesArticleJan 2018Y.-L.

StyuginSystems that have a complex technical implementation usually contain many vulnerabilities which cannot be found at the development stage. Security of complex sys- tems can be improved by protecting them from external research. When the operating algorithm of a system re- mains concealed then it will be more difficult to compromise the system. The present paper reviews a method of modeling information systems, which allows formalizing the amount of information obtained by a researcher. Two methods of establishing systems protected from research are presented. One method is related to complicating the algorithms and the other one is related to their multiplication. Implementation in encryption systems proves fulfillment of cipher security conditions with their modification. Experimental study of the obtained encryptor demonstrated its effectiveness in protecting from many existing types of attacks aimed at block cipher algorithms.ViewExpand abstractTurbo unequal error protection codes with multiple protection levelsArticleJan 2017Q. MaoC.-C. ChangMost existing Turbo unequal error protection (UEP) codes provide two error protection levels at the cost of extending the block size of the codeword or increasing the computational complexity. This paper proposes two novel Turbo UEP coding schemes, which provide multiple error protection levels for information bits, according to their different sensitivities to the channel noise. By permuting the information bits and designing the puncturing scheme, multiple error protection levels can be achieved using one encoder without increasing the computational complexity. In addition, the coding rate of the proposed Turbo UEP schemes can be chosen from 1/3 to 1/2. Experimental results show that the information bits with a high protection level resist noise more effectively than those with a low protection level. The proposed UEP schemes provide better capability of error protection for the entire information, compared with the Turbo equal error protection (EEP) schemes and the existing Turbo UEP schemes.View2 Reads1 CitationExpand abstractAttack intention recognition: A reviewArticleJan 2017Abdulghani Ali AhmedNoorul Ahlami Kamarul ZamanSensitive information faces critical risks when it is transmitted through computer networks. Existing protection systems are still limited in their capacities to ensure network information has sufficient confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The rapid development in network technologies has only helped increase network attacks and hide their malicious intent. This paper analyzes attack types and classifies them according to their intent. A causal network approach is used to recognize attackers' plans and predict their intentions. Attack intention is the ultimate attack goal which the attacker attempts to achieve by executing various methods or techniques, and recognizing it will help security administrators select an appropriate protection system.View11 Reads4 CitationsExpand abstractAn investigation on biometric internet securityArticleJan 2017Omprakash KaiwartyaMukesh PrasadS.

ModiM. PrajapatiA. Sharma[...]Devesh JinwalaAttribute Based Encryption is a technique that associates user's attributes with keys. Data is encrypted using a specific policy and only those keys whose attributes satisfy that policy are allowed to decrypt it. In this paper, we propose a secure communication model based on Cipher-text Policy Attribute Based Encryption (CP-ABE). This model allows Role Based Access Control for documents without the use of a secure server to enforce the access policies. We propose a scalable implementation for key revocation and user attribute updation with improved flexibility. Our method uses a key revoke-list and key-version to achieve this. We show the implementation using the CP-ABE toolkit, an open source library that implements the CP-ABE scheme. We also show how confidentiality, integrity and source authentication is achieved in our model.View9 ReadsExpand abstractAccess control based resource allocation in cloud computing environmentArticleJan 2017J. WangJ. LiuH. ZhangIn this paper, we propose a new dynamic resource allocation scheme - Access Control-based Resource Allocation (ACRA) for cloud users in order to address some deficiencies of the current resources allocation mechanisms in some free cloud computing environment. The proposed scheme comprehensively analyses behavior characteristics of cloud users and evaluates user behavior trust using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP), and then dynamically adjusts the resources permission of cloud users according to their behavior trust values, thus effectively controlling user resource utilization. Experimental results show that the ACRA scheme can provide basis for allocating resources dynamically and reasonably to cloud users with different behaviors and improve resource utilization in cloud computing systems.View6 ReadsExpand abstractTurbo unequal error protection codes with multiple protection levelsArticleJan 2017Q.
