Preface
“Why are so few students interested in science?”
This commonly posed question reflects a con-
tinuing worry among educators and cultural
pundits. Here is a slight paraphrase:
“Why do so few youngsters want to become
biologists, when so many are interested in cryp-
tozoology?”
The purpose of my paraphrase is to suggest
that such matters as Loch Ness monsters — or
unidentified flying objects (UFOs) or psychic
phenomena — offer a way of getting students in-
terested in science. These topics are mysteries,
and human beings are naturally curious about
mysteries. In trying to get to the bottom of
them, we find ourselves learning about science
along the way. Moreover, we learn about it in a
way that shows science not to be a boring, cut-
and-dried subject as it is sometimes portrayed in
popular culture.
One doesn’t need to be a formal student, of
course. I was already a teacher when I became
curious about whether Loch Ness monsters
could be real, and my curiosity led me to learn
about — among other things — biology and geol-
ogy and the history, philosophy, and sociology
of science. The latter interests eventually led to
fruitful changes of career and intellectual activ-
ity, for which I have long been grateful. So one
value of cryptozoology lies in its ability to stim-
ulate curiosity and the good things that tend to
follow on that.
Cryptozoology also has value for science it-
self. Though most cryptozoological claims may
never be validated, the few that are vindicated
are likely to be of exceptional interest, as is the
case with the now accepted Giant squid (Archi-
teuthis) that was long regarded as a purely myth-
ical creature (the Kraken) or the almost cer-
tainly existing GIGANTIC OCTOPUS for which
we have only historical evidence and a few bits
of preserved tissue.
Further, cryptozoological investigations
sometimes have beneficial side effects. At Loch
Ness, it was side-scan sonar looking for NESSIES
that discovered (in 1976) a World War II-era
Wellington bomber worth recovering for preser-
vation in a museum. Earlier sonar quests for
NESSIES had, in 1960, revealed previously un-
suspected shoals of Arctic char ( Salvelinus alpi-
nus) in Loch Ness. The realization, spurred by
NESSIE hunting, that very little was known
about the ecology of Loch Ness has led to a va-
riety of useful discoveries and continuing re-
search there.
Scientists can benefit, like everyone else,
from needing to rethink long accepted facts.
When there are persistent reports that people
have seen creatures supposedly extinct, ignored
issues must be faced, whether those creatures are
Pumas ( Puma concolor ) that may be roaming the
eastern United States or the plesiosaur-like
Freshwater Monsters reported from many
lakes besides Loch Ness:
• How sure can we really be that no pumas
are alive east of the Mississippi? Can a lack of
captured or killed specimens be decisive, even as
very few people have gone looking?
• If we can still, in 1976, discover something
such as a Megamouth shark (Megachasma pela-
gios ), is it inconceivable that there are real Sea
MONSTERS, some of which became landlocked
in lakes such as Loch Ness and Loch Morar,
whose depths reach below 700 feet?
And so on. It cannot be a bad thing, every
now and again, to reassess long held conclu-
sions. Never did I teach freshman chemistry
classes without gaining better clarity or a new
insight, through needing to find answers to the
naive questions posed by neophyte students.
Furthermore, cryptozoology is useful to so-
cial science as well as to natural science. The au-
thority that science wields in contemporary so-
XXI
ciety has made it an object of study by histori-
ans, philosophers, political scientists, and sociol-
ogists. For nigh on a century, philosophy of sci-
ence has grappled with the “demarcation” issue:
How do we distinguish real science from pseu-
doscience?. In seeking to answer that question
through examining specific claims that have
been sometimes pronounced pseudoscientific,
one inevitably learns more precisely what real
science actually is. To paraphrase Rudyard
Kipling, “What should they know of science,
who only science know?” Wondering why sci-
ence has ignored NESSIES led me, when I was al-
ready a practicing professional chemist, to better
insight into what science actually is and does.
Cryptozoology affords practice in the most
difficult sort of thinking. In established disci-
plines, peer review and accepted approaches and
paradigms assist in solving puzzles and prob-
lems. By contrast, seeking to solve mysteries
outside the mainstream disciplines means trying
to think critically with the minimum of formu-
laic guidelines, for the eventual solution may be
unlike anything previously encountered. (In the
realm of detective mysteries, an analogy may be
G. K. Chesterton’s Father Brown, who could
find perfectly rational explanations for events
that seem at first to be utterly inexplicable.)
Cryptozoology, then, is valuable on a num-
ber of counts, and many besides myself will re-
joice that this encyclopedia has become avail-
able. Available at last, I might add, for it would
have been very useful to me over the last couple
of decades. Of course, the field has seen several
compendiums, even the recent Cryptozoology A
to Z by Loren Coleman and Jerome Clark,
which gives useful summaries about the most
common topics. Mysterious Creatures , however,
is without precedent in being comprehensive
and a genuinely scholarly reference work.
Everyone interested in cryptozoology — and
many others as well — will want to have this
readily at hand. Nowhere else can one look up
a cryptid (a merely claimed or mythical or sup-
posedly extinct creature) and find reliable in-
formation about the etymology of the name
and variant names, physical description, behav-
ior, tracks, habitat, distribution, significant
sightings, and, far from least, sources and pos-
sible explanations.
Over the years, I have appreciated the several
bibliographies about unorthodox subjects that
George Eberhart has prepared. This encyclope-
dia is an even more valuable contribution.
Henry H. Bauer is emeritus professor of chem-
istry and science studies at the Virginia Poly-
technic Institute and State University, Blacks-
burg. He is the author of The Enigma of Loch
Ness: Making Sense of a Mystery (Chicago: Uni-
versity of Illinois, 1986) and edits the Journal of
Scientific Exploration, for which he wrote “The
Case for the Loch Ness ‘Monster’: The Scientific
Evidence” in the summer 2002 issue.

Howto Use This Book
My first brush with cryptozoology was in 1 960
when I read On the Track of Unknown Animals
by Belgian zoologist Bernard Heuvelmans. It
was a life-changing experience. Heuvelmans’s
masterful scientific, historical, and literary
sleuthing in quest of elusive fauna was both ex-
citing and scholarly: he seemed a combination
of Sherlock Holmes and The Lost World's Pro-
fessor Challenger. His volume prodded my ten-
year-old brain to take a keen interest in not only
science and history but also different languages
and cultures, the evaluation of evidence, and the
rich discoveries that await the fearless explorer
of large library collections. In that sense, I have
been writing this book ever since, and I hope
that, in turn, it may stimulate others to seek out
new species or identify the animals that are lurk-
ing just behind the myths.
What Constitutes a Cryptid?
Cryptids are the alleged animals that a crypto-
zoologist studies. Obviously, someone — either
an ethnic group familiar with a specific habitat,
a traveler to a remote region, or a surprised
homeowner who sees an ALIEN Big Cat or
SKUNK Ape in the backyard — first has to allege
that such animals exist. (Words set in SMALL
CAPITALS refer to entries in the text.) The exam-
ination and evaluation of ethnographic, testi-
monial, and physical evidence to determine the
identity of a cryptid is what cryptozoology is all
about.
Some would say that only those animals
with a reasonable chance of one day becoming
recognized as new species should be included
in this volume and that bizarre, red-eyed ENTI-
TIES such as MOTHMAN or mythical creatures
such as Dragons and Unicorns are beyond
its scope. This is a practical approach for the
zoologist whose aim is to add to knowledge of
the world’s biodiversity, and it is one of cryp-
tozoology’s primary goals as well. However, I
have taken a broader view in this encyclopedia,
for it can be equally important to show how
known animals can pose as cryptids or how
people’s belief systems and expectations can
color their observations of the natural world.
Do Golden eagles ( Aquila chrysaetos , ) occasion-
ally get reported as Big BIRDS or THUNDER-
BIRDS? Are witnesses of Hairy BIPEDS or EAST-
ERN PUMAS in certain parts of Maryland
influenced by the tales of GOATMAN and SNAL-
LYGASTER in those areas?
Solving historical puzzles also seems relevant
to cryptozoology. Just what animals were re-
sponsible for medieval BASILISK lore? Could the
Columbian mammoth ( Mammuthus columbi)
or the Giant short-faced bear ( Arctodus simus t )
have survived somewhat later in time than is
currently supposed and thus be responsible for
Native American legends of the STIFF-LEGGED
Bear?
Most of the mystery animals in this book fall
into one of the following ten categories:
1. Distribution anomalies , or well-known
animals found in locales where they have not
previously been found or are thought extinct,
such as the EASTERN PUMA.
2. Undescribed, unusual, or outsize varia-
tions of known species, such as the Blue
Tiger, Horned Hare, or Giant Ana-
conda.
3. Survivals of recently extinct species, such
as the Ivory-Billed Woodpecker in the
southern United States, thought extinct since
the 1960s.
4. Survivals of species known only from the
fossil record into modern times, such as the
Roa-Roa of New Zealand, which might be a
surviving moa.
5. Survivals of species known only from the
xxiii
fossil record into historical times but found to
have existed later than currently thought,
such as the MUSKOX OF NOYON Uul.
6. Animals not known from the fossil record
but related to known species, such as the AN-
DAMAN Wood Owl or Beebe’s Manta.
7. Animals not known from the fossil record
or bearing a clear relationship to known species ,
such as BlGFOOT and some Sea MONSTERS.
8. Mythical animals with a zoological basis,
such as the GOLDEN Ram.
9. Seemingly paranormal or supernatural en-
tities with some animal-like characteristics ,
such as Black Dogs or Cannibal Giants.
10. Known hoaxes or probable misidentifica-
tions that sometimes crop up in the literature,
such as the COLEMAN Frog and BOTHRODON
PR1DII.
What Do Cryptozoologists Do?
Ultimately, the job of the cryptozoologist is to
strip away the myth, the misidentification, and
the mystery from reports of animals undescribed
by science. When confronted with a new sight-
ing, the investigator’s first task is to see what
local fauna might account for it. The accuracy
and validity of eyewitness testimony must be as-
certained. (For more on this, see Jack Rabbit’s
“Native and Western Eyewitness Testimony in
Cryptozoology,” on pp. xxxv— xliii.) Then, the
potential for a hoax must be evaluated. If a co-
herent body of evidence accumulates to indicate
that a real animal not native to the area is in-
volved, the next step is to determine whether
any living animals fitting the description were
introduced or have lived there all along unno-
ticed by compilers of field guides. Failing that,
an examination of relevant animals in the fossil
record is warranted, with an emphasis on groups
that are known in the region.
Even if nothing in the fossil record matches,
a case could be made for an evolved version of a
known fossil. What plesiosaurs looked like 65
million years ago can only serve as a basic guide
to what they might have evolved into had they
survived the cometary impact at the end of the
Cretaceous period. Our own physical character-
istics have changed greatly even in the past 10
million years. In any event, the fossil record is
incomplete and in most cases can tell us little
about what the outward appearance of an ex-
tinct animal might have been. This leaves much
room for speculation.
Cryptozoologists are sometimes accused of
never wanting to solve a mystery, perhaps be-
cause of the glamour and romance of the un-
known. However, mystery mongering is much
more frequently found in treatments by the
media. Most of us would rather have one less
Yeti or Mokele-Mbembe to worry about,
whether it winds up in a museum or in a long
list of animals that never were.
Mysteries are both a bother and a challenge
to cryptozoologists. They are a bother because
we wonder what some journalist or observer
“got wrong” about an animal that really exists;
after all, we can tolerate only so many “head like
a goat, body like a lion” stories. And mysteries
are a challenge because we feel compelled to use
deductive reasoning and a vast amount of spe-
cialized and interdisciplinary knowledge to find
out what animal — known, unknown, or sup-
posedly extinct — could be the stimulus for a
sighting. The triumph of a solution outweighs
the uncertainty of an incomplete puzzle.
Fieldwork is a crucial though often thankless
part of that solution. Cryptid hunting is expen-
sive, often dangerous, always time-consuming,
usually frustrating, and potentially hazardous to
one’s scientific credibility. But if it weren’t for
the dragon-hunting exploits of W. Douglas
Burden in the 1920s, the Komodo dragon
( Varanus komodoensis) might still be a rumor.
Investigators such as Loren Coleman and Roy
Mackal have taken much criticism along the
way, but they are the ones who are searching for
the hairs and tracks, asking the right questions,
making the plaster casts, and waiting for just the
right Kodak moment when a cryptid’s head and
neck rise above the water. We who write refer-
ence books salute them!
How Is This Book Organized?
The first part of this book contains descriptions
of 1,085 unknown animals, arranged alphabeti-
cally in a field-guide format. Each of these falls
into one of forty major cryptid categories
(shown in capitals), most of them based on ex-
isting classes and orders of known animals. Each
major category offers a brief description of the
animal group associated with it, as well as a list
of the cryptids included. The major categories

A few mystery animals of uncertain taxon-
omy are included in more than one category,
such as the Nandi Bear, a cryptid with varying
characteristics that turns up under BEARS, HYE-
NAS, and Primates.
Most of the entries are structured in a similar
fashion, with a brief identification of the cryptid
followed by information arranged under as
many as twelve of the following sections:
Etymology. The derivation or meaning of the
cryptid’s name. In a few cases, the date of the
name’s first appearance is provided, as well as in-
formation on the person who coined the term. If
the cryptid’s name is not an English word, the
language is given. The language family is shown
in parentheses for non-Western languages — for
example, Lingala (Bantu), “water monster.” Cur-
rent names for ethnic groups, their languages, and
language families were identified or verified in
Ethnologue: Languages of the World, at
http://www.ethnologue.com, or Andrew Dalby’s
Dictionary of Languages (1998). Numerous phrase
books and dictionaries were also consulted.
Scientific name. In some cases, a cryptid has
been assigned a Latin or Greek scientific name
by a researcher who has investigated it, such as
Nessiteras rhomb opteryx for NESSIE, given by
Peter Scott and Robert Rines in 1975. When a
cryptid is welcomed into the ranks of known an-
imals, such a name could become the genus and
species designation used for the formal scientific
description, unless an existing genus is more ap-
propriate. The binomial method of naming liv-
ing creatures was proposed in the eighteenth
century by Carl von Linne. The first name is
generic, as in Homo; the second is specific, as in
sapiens. Animals with the same generic name are
said to belong to the same genus, while the spe-
cific name identifies the species.
Variant names. Other names by which a
cryptid is known are found in this section.
These may include alternate spellings and geo-
graphic variants. Other languages, language
families (following the slash mark), and mean-
ings (in quotation marks) are given in parenthe-
ses — for example, Meshe-adam (Azerbaijani/
Turkic, “forest man”).
Physical description. This section provides a
summary of the appearance of the cryptid. In-
formation is listed in the following order: gen-
eral appearance, length, height, diameter,
weight, color or coat, head, face, eyes, ears, nos-
trils, cheeks, mouth and teeth, chin, neck and
shoulders, chest and torso, arms, hands, wings,
back, legs, feet, and tail. Since the description is
often derived from multiple sources (sighting re-
ports and other testimony), there is a possibility
that some erroneous data are included.
HOWTO USE THIS BOOK xxv
Behavior. A summary of the habits and inter-
actions of the cryptid is offered in this section. In-
formation is listed in the following order: period
of activity (such as nocturnal or diurnal), pre-
ferred area of operations (such as aquatic or arbo-
real), stance and locomotion (such as bipedal
movement or vertical undulations), vocalizations,
sensory capabilities, odor, food, sleep and nesting
habits, reproductive strategies, social interactions,
interspecies interactions, human interactions,
and technology. Uncertain or doubtful behaviors
are often introduced by the phrase is said to.
Tracks. Dimensions and characteristics of
footprints or other impressions left by a cryptid
on the ground or in snow are described in this
section.
Habitat. Here, details are provided about the
specific environment in which a cryptid lives,
whether in the sea (abyssal, coastal, etc.) or on
land (forests, desert, scrubland, etc.).
Distribution. This section describes the geo-
graphic range where sightings of the cryptid are
said to occur. Specific landscape features (such
as mountains and lakes) are provided when
known; otherwise, country names and their sub-
divisions (such as states, provinces, and depart-
ments) are given. Place-names are those in use as
of 2001; all previous political designations (for
instance, Rhodesia, Yakutia, or Jaffa) have been
updated to their modern equivalents (Zim-
babwe, Sakha Republic, or Yafo). The Mi-
crosoft Encarta Atlas 2000 was used to verify
present status in most cases; current political di-
visions were identified in Gwillim Law’s Admin-
istrative Subdivisions of Countries (1999).
Significant sightings. Capsule summaries of
either important or typical observations of a
cryptid are arranged in chronological order in
this section. The examples are by no means
comprehensive. Most of these observations are
anecdotal in nature, although in some instances,
the “sighting” involves an artifact, petroglyph,
or sonar contact. The observed characteristics of
the animal are not repeated, unless they are
atypical or more detailed than those given in the
preceding physical description section. All older
place-names have been modernized.
Present status. This section contains notes
on whether a cryptid is likely to be extinct, as
well as other comments and data that do not fit
elsewhere.
Possible explanations. This section lists more
or less reasonable hypotheses as to what the
cryptid might be, either as a misidentification of
a known species, as an unknown species, or as a
survival of an extinct species. An explanation’s
position in the list does not reflect the likeli-
hood of its validity. Sometimes, there is more
than one probable hypothesis for sightings of a
given cryptid. In most cases, I have avoided
making personal judgments, preferring instead
to wait until a definitive answer has emerged;
however, I have pointed out the ways in which
certain arguments are weak. Both common and
scientific names are given for known animals.
The lack of this section for a given cryptid may
mean either that there is too little information
for anyone to make an informed guess or that a
discussion of the possibilities is found elsewhere;
for example, CHEMISIT explanations are found
under Nandi Bear, and Ksy-Gyik candidates
are discussed generally under WlLDMEN.
Sources. This section offers a selected list of
references for further consultation, with an em-
phasis on firsthand, scientific sources, as well as
the most informative books and journal articles.
The sources are arranged by the date of original
appearance, which puts ancient and medieval
sources at the beginning of the list despite later
imprint dates.
A geologic timescale appears on p. xlv to aid
in visualizing the periods of the earth’s history
and the development of life.
The second part of this book, “Animals Dis-
covered since 1900” (pp. 623-654), is an anno-
tated list of 431 species or other taxonomic
groups described or rediscovered since the turn
of the twentieth century, arranged by type of
animal. One of the criticisms leveled at crypto-
zoology is that large, noticeable animals are not
likely to have remained unknown to science for
centuries. However, the wide variety of organ-
isms that have turned up only in recent years —
which were previously unnoticed by scientists —
is extraordinary when viewed en masse. Among
those animals are forty-seven new primates,
twenty-nine new hoofed mammals, and fifteen
new cetaceans.
The third part, “Lake and River Monsters”
(pp. 655-690), is a list of 884 bodies of water
worldwide said to contain FRESHWATER MON-
STERS or other large aquatic animals. Some are
xxvi HOWTO USE THIS BOOK
named and appear in the A-Z part of the book
(such as NESSIE or Champ), while others are un-
named, vaguely defined, semimythical, or little
more than rumor. Brief descriptions are given
when known. To my knowledge, this is the most
comprehensive and accurate list compiled to date.
What Further Resources Are Available?
Several sources keep cryptozoologists up-to-date
on sightings, discoveries, and theories. The
monthly British periodical Fortean Times (dis-
tributed in the United States by Eastern News
Distributors, 2020 Superior St., Sandusky, OH
44870) regularly contains news and features on
cryptids. Its Web site (http://www.fo rteantimes.
com) offers breaking news on mystery animals.
The approximately annual Anomalist (P.O.
Box 12434, San Antonio, TX 78212) often fea-
tures cryptozoological topics. It also has a
newsline (http://www.anomalist.com) .
Several relevant discussion groups are avail-
able on the Yahoo! Groups site (http: //groups.
yahoo.com), both public ones and those for
members only. The members-only cryptozool-
ogy group (cz) is one of the best. There are also
several BlGFOOT and NESSIE groups.
The monthly Fate magazine (P.O. Box 460,
Lakeville, MN 55044) has been publishing
cryptozoological news and articles since 1948,
though its focus is primarily on psychic phe-
nomena. Some features are available on line
(http://www.fatemag.com) .
The Centre for Fortean Zoology in England
publishes the quarterly Animals and Men (15
Holne Court, Exeter, U.K. EX4 2NA) and a
yearbook with longer features. Back volumes are
available (http : / / www. eclipse. co . uk/ cfz /) .
The Eastern Puma Research Network (P.O.
Box 3562, Baltimore, MD 21214) has a quar-
terly newsletter that provides information on
sightings and statistics.
The British Columbia Scientific Cryptozool-
ogy Club (Suite 2305, 8805 Hudson St., Van-
couver, BC, Canada V6P 4M9) has a quarterly
newsletter and an on-line site (http://www.
ultranet.ca/bcscc/) .
Mark A. Hall’s Wonders (407 Racine Dr.,
Box E, Wilmington, NC 28403) is published
four times a year. Back issues are available, and
their contents are listed on his Web site (http://
home, att.net/ ^mark.hall. wonders/).
The Web site of the Institut Virtuel de Cryp-
tozoologie in France (http: //www. cryptozoo.

Unfortunately, some excellent journals are
no longer published, and back issues are diffi-
cult to find. The International Society of
Cryptozoology is gone, along with its ISC
Newsletter and refereed journal Cryptozoology.
Pursuit , INFO Journal, Exotic Zoology, and
Cryptozoology Review have ceased publication
as well, and the future of Strange Magazine is
uncertain. It is almost always a good idea to
obtain whatever is currently available before it
becomes unfindable.
The same can be said of many cryptozoology
books, especially those that are self-published or
put out by small or alternative presses. Acade-
mic and public libraries do not collect this ma-
terial. Once it’s out of print, you are out of luck,
unless you are willing to put up with inflated
prices on eBay. One excellent mail-order source
for current and out-of-print books and journals
is Arcturus Books (1443 S.E. Port St. Lucie
Blvd., Port St. Lucie, FL 34952). Though pri-
marily devoted to UFO books, its catalog regu-
larly contains crypto titles.
Many people have been fooled into thinking
that everything is available on the Web and
HOWTO USE THIS BOOK xxvii
that it is a vast, free library accessible at the
click of a search engine. This just isn’t true,
even if you add in the resources on what has
been called the Invisible Web, which contains
data that are not directly findable by search en-
gines. The Web is the biggest encyclopedia in
the world, and it is constantly updated, but
there are huge gaps in its coverage that make it
only a supplement to printed books and jour-
nals and not a replacement.
If I had relied exclusively on the Internet in
preparing this book, it would have been only
about 1 5 percent of its current length and prob-
ably would have included much misinforma-
tion. And if I had relied solely on print re-
sources, it would have been only 85 percent as
long, would have taken four years to complete
instead of two, and would not have been as up-
to-date at the point of publication.
When setting out to research a cryptozoolog-
ical topic, begin by examining the sources given
for cryptids in this book. Focus on specific ani-
mals or topics. Figure out how much you want
to know about the subject, and narrow or widen
your searches accordingly. Be forewarned that
one source may lead you to many others, some-
times only to answer new questions that have
been raised. Go where the information is,
whether it’s on the Web or in the library. The
answer you are looking for may be in a 1995
issue of Fortean Times , a 1903 issue of the
Chicago Tribune , a field guide to Indonesian
birds, a Tibetan-English dictionary, a 1966 arti-
cle in an Australian herpetological journal, or
the on-line FishBase resource.
Always evaluate and question the informa-
tion you find. Double-check specific facts, if
possible. When you find a new source of infor-
mation, ask these questions:
• Is the source scholarly, popular, govern-
mental, or commercial?
• What are the author’s credentials?
• When was the information originally
published?
• In what country did it originate?
• What is the reputation of the publisher,
distributor, or Web site?
• Does the source show any specific biases?
• Does it offer a bibliography or adequate
documentation for the information it
provides?
• Are there a large number of misspelled
words and names? Authors who are sloppy
about spelling are often sloppy with facts.
• For what audience is the material in-
tended?
• Is it suitable for your level of understand-
ing of the subject?
• Does it have the features you need: illus-
trations, graphs, charts, tables, definitions,
maps?
• Is it current?
• Are various points of view represented?
• Are the conclusions justified by the facts
presented?
When you run across a new account of a
cryptid sighting, ask the six journalistic ques-
tions:
• Who reported the sighting? Are they
trained observers or knowledgeable about
the local fauna?
• What actually was seen? Are there enough
details for you to be certain that it could
not have been a known animal?
• Where was the sighting reported? Can you
find the location on a map?
• When did it occur? Is the information
specific (for example, citing day and time)
or vague (making reference, perhaps, to an
event several summers ago)?
• How did the event unfold? Are the behav-
iors of the observers and the cryptid ac-
counted for and credible?
• Why did the sighting get reported? Did
the witness contact a newspaper, local au-
thorities, a scientific organization, or a
cryptozoologist?
Finally, determine whether the information
you have found is consistent with what you have
located in other sources. If it’s not, don’t auto-
matically assume that the new material is wrong;
it may well be that the older sources were in error.

Introduction
If We Don’t Search, We Shall Never Discover
Passion and cryptozoology go hand in hand.
Enthusiasm and zeal fill my mind and body
when I think about getting into the field in pur-
suit of real, flesh-and-blood animals waiting to
be discovered.
Did excitement dwell within me, you might
wonder, when a game warden and I trekked for
hours in the mud on a hot midwestern after-
noon in 1963, looking for signs of a black pan-
ther? Was it fun during the nights of cold in
that tent in the Trinity-Shasta area of Califor-
nia, as I tracked an elusive BlGFOOT through
those forests in 1974? Was it enjoyable to expe-
rience the biting rain on myself and my lads,
Malcolm and Caleb, during the daylong soak-
ing we received in an open boat on Loch Ness
in 1999?
Needless to say, the answer for a cryptozool-
ogist is “Yes!” With a fervor that flourished in
another time, groups of women and men spend
their todays searching for cryptids that may to-
morrow be new species, pursuing creatures that
may not even exist, looking for animals that the
thinnest of evidence says are real, and listening
to rumors and tales of others just over the hori-
zon. The late Bernard Heuvelmans wrote in
1988: “Cryptozoological research should be ac-
tuated by two major forces: patience and pas-
sion.” While he may have never caught a single
cryptid in his life, he knew all too well about the
search.
Cryptozoologists are reliving a time two cen-
turies ago when all of zoology was in an age of
discovery. This field preserves the spirit of those
days. But by the beginning of the twentieth cen-
tury, zoology seemed to have slipped into a pe-
riod in which new species were fully revealed
only as a circumstance of taxonomy and cladis-
tic debates were far in the future. Animal dis-
coveries were incidental, certainly not the true
mission.
That would all change, first with a quiet tra-
dition of examining the curiosities of natural
history beginning at the end of the nineteenth
century, as seen in the writings of, for example,
Philip Henry Gosse and Francis T. Buckland.
With the advent in the twentieth century of a
modern generation of zoology authors, such as
Willy Ley and Henry Wendt, the time was ripe
for a renewed interest in fauna whispered about
but not acknowledged. It was then that two
gentlemen came along whom I knew personally
and who would inspire a fresh cohort of
searchers.
Ivan T. Sanderson, a Scottish zoologist living
in the United States, wrote an article for the
January 3, 1948, Saturday Evening Post titled
“There Could Be Dinosaurs.” In France, Bel-
gian zoologist Bernard Heuvelmans read this
essay on the possible survival of extinct animals
in Africa, and it changed his life forever. Sander-
son had trekked through tropical jungles (we
call them rain forests now) in South America,
Africa, and Asia. Heuvelmans had spent years
reviewing the scientific literature and gleaning
the zoological treasures hidden there. In the
1995 revision of his On the Track of Unknown
Animals (pp. XXIII-XXIV), Heuvelmans ex-
pressed the stirrings he found inside himself that
would call for a release in cryptozoology:
In the 1950s, I was an angry young
zoologist, indignant at the ostracism
imposed by official science — we would say
today the scientific Establishment — on
those animals known only through the
reports of isolated travelers, or through often
fantastic native legends, or from simple but
mysterious footprints, or the recital of
sometimes bloody depredations, or through
traditional images, or even a few ambiguous
photos.
XXXI
Instances of this sort were, in fact, quite
numerous. These were attested to by files,
often quite thick, which in general gathered
dust at the bottom of drawers or, at the
most, were considered as “amusing
curiosities.” It would have been much
better to term them “the secret archives of
zoology,” or even, since they were in some
way shameful in the eyes of correct
thinkers, “the Hades of zoological
literature.” It had in fact been decreed on
high and, moreover, in a totally arbitrary
fashion, that only those species for which
there existed a representative specimen,
duly registered in some institution, or at
the least an identifiable fragment of a
specimen, could be admitted into
zoological catalogues.
Lacking this, they were banned from the
Animal Kingdom, and zoologists were
morally constrained to speak of them only
with an exasperated shrug of the shoulder or
a mocking smile.
To propose devoting a profound study to
sea-serpents, the Abominable Snowman, the
Loch Ness monster, or to all such-like,
amounted to straightforward provocation.
Furthermore, no scientific publication
would have accepted it for printing unless,
of course, it ended with the conclusion that
the being in question was the result of
popular imagination, founded on some
misapprehension, or the product of a hoax.
As for myself, however, in spite of my status
as professional zoologist and my university
degrees, I dreamed of delivering all of those
condemned beasts from the ghetto in which
they had so unjustly been confined, and to
bring them to be received into the fold of
zoology.
Independently, these men — one of the field
and one of the library — would invent the same
word and go on to become the mutual godfa-
thers of cryptozoology, the study of unknown or
hidden animals. The new science would formal-
ize and rescue “romantic zoology” from the days
of discovery during the Victorian era, bringing it
into the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.
Heuvelmans’s books, On the Track of Unknown
Animals (1958) and In the Wake of the Sea Ser-
pents (1965), and Sanderson’s Abominable Snow-
men: Legend Come to Life (1961) became the
canvases on which many of us first saw the
beauty of the pursuit.
While I was growing up, I had a strange no-
tion that I wanted to become a naturalist, in the
oldest meaning of the word. Instead, I did one
better: I became a cryptozoologist.
Cryptozoologists All
There are many different kinds of cryptozoolo-
gists. Some do fieldwork, some do archival re-
search, and others are chroniclers. The field is
open to a wide variety of disciplines because the
essence of cryptozoology is multidisciplinary.
You can become a cryptozoologist in many
ways, but applying for the job through a newspa-
per advertisement is not likely to be one of them.
Nobody hires a cryptozoologist to investigate
whether a cryptid in a nearby lake is really there.
Instead, cryptozoologists tend to seek positions
that give them some freedom to pursue their re-
search, whether in university careers (Grover
Krantz, Roy Mackal, Jeff Meldrum, myself), in
wildlife management roles (Bruce S. Wright), in
government service (Mark A. Hall), or as editors
and writers (Ivan T. Sanderson, Bernard Heuvel-
mans, John Green). I teach at a university, con-
sult, research, and write. I believe my accountant
puts “professor/author” on my tax forms. Various
educational backgrounds (anthropology, linguis-
tics, zoology, biology, and especially other life sci-
ences) are helpful, and other talents and training
go into making one a cryptozoologist.
In 2002, while discussing a case of newly dis-
covered tracks in Pennsylvania, Mark A. Hall
and I were identified by the media as “cryptozo-
ologists” and “scientists.” It is usually someone
else who labels cryptozoologists as scientists, and
this incident led to an exchange between Hall
and myself on this matter. As Hall noted:
Science is done by people who are paid to
perform science and they are the scientists.
However, we are amateur scientists in the
old sense of the phrase. The sciences grew
out of people who were amateurs who
established something new. “Amateur” in
the modern sense is not so complimentary.
When looking backward, scientists can be
understanding about the value of amateurs
xxxii INTRODUCTION
in their fields, such as the expert in
rattlesnakes (now dead) who wrote what are
considered the best books on the subject.
Or E. A. Hooton who was a top name in
primates even though his degree was
something like English literature. . . . Our
culture is going to determine whether we
are scientists, not us. At present someone
sees us as scientists. It is not my inclination
to say that they are wrong.
The example of J. L. B. Smith is also worth
noting. Smith was a chemistry professor in
South Africa when, one could say, cryptozoology
discovered him in 1938 by mere chance when a
young museum curator asked him a question
about a peculiar fish, which turned out to be the
first living coelacanth discovered. Smith was an
amateur ichthyologist who became an amateur
cryptozoologist, and in 1952, he caught the sec-
ond coelacanth through cryptozoological meth-
ods — by talking to locals, looking for the animal
where they said it might be found, spreading the
word that he was interested, and applying all his
passion and patience to a fruitful end.
Cryptozoology entails a vast amount of im-
portant but tedious work, such as searching
through newspaper microfilm, library archives,
or researchers’ old files: not all of the work is
spent in hot pursuit of animals in the field.
There is also the labor of tracking down wit-
nesses and double-checking their credibility.
But the ultimate goal is thrilling. To be seriously
involved in chasing mystery animals and inves-
tigating extraordinary incidents that have hap-
pened to ordinary people is, indeed, exciting.
Modern cryptozoology is also international
in scope, thanks to Vietnamese, French, Rus-
sian, Spanish, and other non-English-speaking
researchers, and it is seen today as the study of
the evidence for hidden animals. This definition
emphasizes the forensics that have become so
important to cryptozoology — for example, cast-
ing footprints, gathering hair and fecal samples,
and collecting relevant cultural artifacts.
Can You Study to
Become a Cryptozoologist?
I am sorry to say that very few cryptozoology
classes are given. I taught a full-credit one in
1990 and since that time have used large doses
of cryptozoology in my 100-student university
course for juniors and seniors on documentary
film. Today, no formal cryptozoology degree
programs are available anywhere. So my advice
would be to pick whatever subject you are most
interested in (primates? felids? native tales? giant
squids? fossil humans?) and then match it up
with the field of study that is linked to that sub-
ject (anthropology, zoology, linguistics, marine
science, paleoanthropology). Pursue that sub-
ject, pick the college or university that is highly
regarded in the field, and you just might de-
velop a niche in cryptozoology. I studied an-
thropology and zoology, then moved on to a
more psychologically based graduate degree to
understand the human factor. I also took doc-
toral courses in anthropology.
Existing zoology and anthropology depart-
ments cover many subjects, and there is no reason
why cryptozoological topics cannot occasionally
be addressed in such venues. In addition, more
and more professors are opening their minds to
cryptozoology and hominology. Some young
people who grew up with SASQUATCH are, believe
it or not, becoming professors, and a few are in-
volved in cryptozoology. This is a good sign, and
it makes it easier to pass on environmental con-
cerns (habitat loss can thwart animal discoveries)
to a new generation of students.
Several departmental courses around the coun-
try have already included some cryptozoological
topics, and guest speakers have occasionally been
invited to lecture. Such choices at universities are
still rare, but cryptozoology in the twenty-first
century appears ready for a growth spurt.
With passion and patience, more animals
will be discovered and more cryptozoologists
will be born. You could be tomorrow’s Ruth
Harkness, the discoverer of the Giant panda
( Ailuropoda melanoleuca ), or Hans Schom-
burgk, the discoverer of the Pygmy hippopota-
mus ( Hexaprotodon liberiensis ) .

INTRODUCTION xxxiii
Native and Western Eyewitness
Testimony in Cryptozoology
On an Internet-based cryptozoology forum, this
question was recently posed: How should we
evaluate the validity of eyewitness accounts from
native peoples ? I shall attempt to answer that
question. The issue of native eyewitness testi-
mony is of considerable importance to crypto-
zoologists, as such accounts are a major compo-
nent of the body of evidence for many
purportedly undiscovered animal species. Na-
tive testimony typically receives either one of
two opposite and inappropriate treatments in
cryptozoological literature, depending on the
author’s agenda: wholesale dismissal or whole-
sale acceptance.
In this article, I’ll present examples that illus-
trate why neither wholesale dismissal nor whole-
sale acceptance of native testimony is reason-
able. Then I’ll discuss the factors that are known
to affect the validity of eyewitness testimony in
general (gleaned from the substantial body of
published research on the topic), with com-
ments on how those factors may bear on native
eyewitnesses. Finally, I’ll offer my own thoughts
on a few factors that may apply mainly or ex-
clusively to native eyewitnesses, born in cultures
and environments different from our own.
The Invalidity of Wholesale
Dismissal of Native Testimony
Historically, Westerners have viewed native
peoples as inferior — at best, like naive children;
at worst, like base animals. Regrettably, scien-
tists have often reinforced this popular miscon-
ception (Durant and Durant, 1968; Gould,
1981). Native “folk tales” were regarded as prat-
tle, without scientific significance of any sort —
as products of “the overheated imagination of
natives, which is sometimes influenced by alco-
hol or the love of rousing sensation” (Kitten-
berger, 1929). Consequently, the considerable
wisdom (including, but by no means limited to,
knowledge about local animals and plants) ac-
cumulated by various non-Western societies was
largely ignored.
In recent years, Western researchers have
come to realize the error of their earlier thinking
with regard to native peoples. Scientific studies
have shown certain outlandish-sounding claims
by native observers to be true, or at least to have
a basis in fact. Two interesting examples: the
Matses Indians’ tales of a frog that produces a
“magic potion” that can be used to enhance
hunting prowess; and the assertions by New
Guinean tribesmen that certain local birds are
poisonous.
The Matses (Panoan) Indians of Peru claim
that sapo, a sticky substance excreted from the
skin of the Giant monkey tree frog ( Phyllome -
dusa bicolor ), lends a hunter superhuman en-
durance and renders him invisible to game ani-
mals. Western biochemists have assayed the
frog’s skin secretions, and found that they con-
tain chemicals that suppress pain, thirst, and
hunger. A hunter under the influence of sapo
may be able to withstand physical hardships that
would otherwise distract him from his game-
tracking. Sapo also contains powerful emetics,
diuretics, and laxatives. Researchers speculate
that these agents flush the hunter’s body of
odorous compounds, thereby making him “in-
visible” (in an olfactory, not optical, manner) to
his quarry (Erspamer et ah, 1993).
The New Guineans’ claim that the Hooded
pitohui or “garbage bird” ( Pitohui dichrous) is
poisonous seemed highly unlikely when it was
first recorded in Birds of My Kalam Country , a
compilation of the New Guinea highlanders’
folklore (Majnep and Bulmer, 1977). Western
scientists had been acquainted with these com-
mon birds for over a century, and had not dis-
covered any evidence of chemical defense. Fur-
ther, of the approximately 9,000 known species
XXXV
Giant monkey tree frog fPhyllomedusa bicolorj. (Painting [acrylic on canvas] by Jack Rabbit, © 1999)
of birds, not one was known to produce a poi-
son or venom of any sort (Diamond, 1992).
However, in 1990, Western ornithologists inde-
pendently and accidentally discovered that han-
dling the live Hooded pitohui caused “numb-
ness, burning, and sneezing” (Dumbacher et ah,
1992). Subsequent analysis of pitohui tissues re-
vealed the presence of homobatrachotoxin, the
same poisonous compound secreted by a genus
of Poison-dart frogs ( Phyllobates ) from Central
and South America. In the concluding para-
graph of his pitohui commentary in Nature

few remaining Stone Age hunters?”
The Invalidity of Wholesale
Acceptance of Native Testimony
In the light of these findings and many others
like them, we can see that our previous arrogant
dismissal of native wisdom was unwarranted. In
our recent reassessment of indigenous cultures,
however, we now tend to go too far the other
way. A substantial body of recent popular liter-
ature portrays all natives as sages — infinitely
wise about their environments, infallible in mat-
ters regarding local flora and fauna. See for ex-
ample such magazines as Pangaia and Green
Egg , and Mario Morgan’s controversial novel
Mutant Message Down Under (Morgan, 1994).
This new attitude, while perhaps less offensive
than the old one, is equally absurd. The follow-
ing examples — the Apris of Somalia and the Bis-
cobra of India — illustrate that while natives may
exhibit considerable knowledge about the ani-
mals among which they live, that knowledge is
sometimes faulty.
Spawls (1979) tells us that the Somalis fear
the APRIS, a snake so venomous that its mere
touch causes death within seconds. Spawls him-
self has positively identified a specimen of the
snake — before an audience of terrified Somali
witnesses — as Gongylophis colubrinus , a nonven-
omous and inoffensive sand boa.
Minton and Minton (1969) report that na-
tives of northern India tell chilling stories of the
BlS-COBRA, whose name indicates it has the
killing power of 20 cobras. The culprit turns
out to be the harmless gecko Eublepharis hard-
xxxvi NATIVE AND WESTERN EYEWITNESS TESTIMONY IN CRYPTOZOOLOGY

wickii. In Pakistan, natives call the related
gecko Eublepharis macularius the Hun-khun,
and hold it to be “the deadliest creature . . .
more dangerous than the Cobra.” Similar su-
perstitions surround likewise innocuous geckos
in various regions all over the world, including
Egypt, Java, Mexico, and Argentina (Minton
and Minton, 1969; Goodman and Hobbs,
1994; personal observation).
Both errors in evaluation of native ac-
counts — wholesale dismissal and wholesale ac-
ceptance — stem from the same flaw in thinking:
the belief that native peoples are fundamentally
different from Westerners. Although they live in
different environments and have different be-
liefs, they are not beings wholly unlike us. Like
us, they have the capacity for wisdom and logic;
like us, they have the capacity for folly and su-
perstition. In spite of cultural differences, New
Yorkers and New Guineans share the same sen-
sory apparatus and the same sort of brain with
which to process sensory input. It follows, there-
fore, that all of us share the same limitations in
our ability to perceive, to interpret, and to recall
objects and events. In considering how to evalu-
ate native eyewitness accounts of cryptid ani-
mals, then, I propose that we should look at how
experts evaluate Western eyewitness testimony,
and note those factors in which a witness’s cul-
tural background may play a significant role.
Authors of cryptozoological literature often
adopt an indignant and contemptuous tone
when they discuss attempts to explain eyewit-
ness testimony in terms of ordinary phenomena.
In such an attempt, the cryptozoologists claim,
is the implicit assertion that the witnesses are
lying, or insane, or merely stupid. I hope that
after you’ve read through the following findings
on eyewitness reliability, you’ll realize that a wit-
ness can represent a falsehood as truth without
lying; that a witness can hallucinate without
being insane; and that a witness can misinterpret
what he has seen without being stupid. All hu-
mans — even the most honest, the most level-
headed, the keenest-eyed, the smartest — have
imperfect perception and imperfect memory. A
NATIVE AND WESTERN EYEWITNESS TESTIMONY IN CRYPTOZOOLOGY xxxvii
variety of factors bear upon our ability to per-
ceive an event correctly, and later to recall cor-
rectly what we have perceived.
Factors Affecting Reliability
of Eyewitness Testimony
Researchers into the validity of eyewitness testi-
mony identify the following factors as affecting
reliability:
Slippage of memory. Witnesses recall details
more accurately immediately after an event than
they do after a long period of time has elapsed
(Loftus, 1979). This phenomenon is called slip-
page of memory, and its effect is progressive. A
memory accurate an hour after an event will be
less accurate after a week, less accurate still after
a month, and even less accurate after a year.
Period of observation. Witnesses notice more
details and recall them more accurately with in-
creased observation time (Buckhout, 1974;
Williams et al., 1992). Also noteworthy when
considering period of observation is the fact that
witnesses almost always overestimate the dura-
tion of a recalled event (Loftus, 1979).
Observation conditions. Witnesses are able to
make more accurate observations at close range
than at long range, and in bright light than in
dim light (Buckhout, 1974). In cryptozoologi-
cal eyewitness accounts, obstructions (like fo-
liage) and weather conditions (like rain or fog)
may further impede accurate observation.
Fear and stress. Witnesses are less accurate in
recalling details of events during which they ex-
perienced fear or high stress (Buckhout, 1974;
Dent and Stephenson, 1979; Williams et al.,
1992). A witness who is confronted with a large,
unknown animal is more likely to be concerned
with escaping harm than with making accurate
observations of the animal’s anatomical fea-
tures — features critical for making a positive
identification later. Peter Byrne (1975), who
catalogs scores of SASQUATCH sightings in his
book The Search for Bigfoot, comments: “The
reaction of most people who encounter a Big-
foot seems fairly standard. The usual pattern is
one of shock, surprise, often followed by near-
panic and rapid flight.”
One can well imagine that a witness in a state
of “near panic” and in the act of “rapid flight”
might have difficulty recalling the finer details
of his BlGFOOT encounter.
Expectancy. Witnesses tend to see what they
expect to see (Buckhout, 1974; Williams et al.,
1992). I consider this factor to be hugely signif-
icant in evaluating native eyewitness accounts. If
the witness has been raised from infancy hearing
folk stories about a terrible beast that lurks in
the nearby forests, he’s apt to make minimal ob-
served data (a loud crash in the brush, a quick
blurry glimpse of something) fit his expectations.
This phenomenon occurs in Western cultures as
well — although probably with less frequency,
because belief in monsters is generally discour-
aged. Binns (1984) records the following eye-
witness account from Loch Ness: “I saw a heavy
wash or wake such as a motor-boat might pro-
duce, and I thought: ‘Now when I get round
that rocky promontory I’ll possibly see the
Monster.’ But when I rounded the bend I saw a
couple of swans. On the smooth water the
waves appeared all out of proportion to their
source.”
On any other lake, the witness would proba-
bly have immediately thought of a mundane ex-
planation for unusual surface turbulence; but
since the incident occurred on notorious Loch
Ness, he thought first of the elusive NESSIE.
Want or need on the part of the witness. Wit-
nesses tend to see what they want to see (Buck-
hout, 1974). This factor is perhaps more signif-
icant for enthusiastic cryptozoologists than for
natives. In an article for Fortean Times, self-
described “armchair cryptozoologist” Ronald
Rosenblatt (1996) describes his encounter with
the “nearly extinct” Rhinoceros iguana ( Cyclura
cornuta ) in the parking lot of the Miami
Seaquarium: “Although I am no expert, [the
lizard] looked to me like a giant iguanid. In fact,
it looked most like the now nearly extinct Rhi-
noceros Iguana.”
The photograph that accompanies the article
does indeed depict an adult Cyclura (probably
C. cornuta). However, C. cornuta is only “nearly
extinct” on its native Hispaniola. In the United
States, it is a popular cage pet, and escapees are
not uncommon in Miami. I myself have col-
lected two specimens during my two-year stay
in the area.
Rosenblatt continues: “When I looked into
the matter, I discovered that . . . while some
large lizards have turned up in southern Florida,
they have been monitor lizards, not iguanids like
xxxviii NATIVE AND WESTERN EYEWITNESS TESTIMONY IN CRYPTOZOOLOGY
the animal I saw. . . . This odd experience
changed my attitude toward people who report
strange animals. When one has had such an ex-
perience, it is no longer possible to accept the de-
rision of the skeptics at face value. What could
be more unlikely than seeing a giant lizard in the
middle of a huge city? It would be easy to doubt
the truth of my experience, yet I know it hap-
pened and the photographs back me up. I didn’t
imagine the lizard and I didn’t exaggerate its
size.
Rosenblatt did not exercise due diligence in
his research. The Audubon Society Field Guide to
North American Reptiles and Amphibians (Behler
and King, 1979) lists two large introduced
iguanids, the Common iguana ( Iguana iguana)
and the Spiny-tailed iguana ( Ctenosaura pecti-
nated), as occurring in Miami. Iguana iguana is so
abundant that city officials have posted a promi-
nent “Iguana Crossing” sign less than a kilome-
ter from the location of Rosenblatt’s sighting.
Seeing a giant lizard in Miami is like seeing
a stray cat in any other big metropolitan area.
Seeing a Cyclura cornuta in Miami is like see-
ing a stray purebred Siamese cat — unusual, to
be sure, but not newsworthy and certainly not
inexplicable.
Fabrication of memories. Witnesses some-
times remember events that, quite simply, never
happened (Buckhout, 1974; Dent and Stephen-
son, 1979; Williams et al., 1994). They aren’t
lying; they just remember incorrectly. This phe-
nomenon, called confabulation, is well known
and extensively verified experimentally.
Witnesses seem particularly prone to confab-
ulate their presence at “historically significant
events” (Buckhout, 1974). In Cryptozoology A to
Z (1999), Loren Coleman and Jerome Clark
record the following account of a huge, di-
nosaur-like MOKELE-MBEMBE’s attack on a small
West African village: “Pascal Moteka, who lived
near Lake Tele, said his people had once con-
structed a barrier of wooden spikes across a river
to keep the giant beasts from interfering with
their fishing. When Mokele-mbembe tried to
break through the barrier, the assembled vil-
lagers managed to kill it with spears. Celebrating
their triumph, the people butchered and cooked
the carcass, but everyone who ate the dinosaur
meat died shortly afterwards.”
Moteka does not claim to have witnessed the
incident, so this is not a confabulated tale.
However, the described event provides fertile
material for confabulation. The story is both
“historically significant” and highly improbable.
Upon hearing a witness claim his presence at
such an incident, the interviewer is faced with
two immediately intuitive possibilities: that the
witness is giving an accurate account of an ac-
tual event, or that the witness is lying. Findings
on fabricated memories, however, suggest a
third possibility: that the witness is telling the
truth — in all sincerity, and to the best of his rec-
ollection — about an event that never took place.
The details of the fabricated memory may be
pieced together from folk stories, from vivid
childhood dreams, from an actual but dimly re-
membered conflict between villagers and a
hippo or elephant, or even from information ac-
cidentally imparted by the interviewer himself.
Completion of fragmentary pictures. Witnesses,
over time, may “fill in the gaps” if their observa-
tion is incomplete (Buckhout, 1974). “I saw a
big black object, apparently moving, in the
water” can become “I saw a big black animal in
the water” in an observer’s memory after a while.
With the passage of time, the “black animal in
the water” may develop eyes, fins, and other fea-
tures and attributes that the witness didn’t claim
to see immediately following the event.
Conformity. Witnesses sometimes alter their
observations to fit those of other witnesses
(Buckhout, 1974; Luus and Wells, 1994). Wit-
nesses feel a greater degree of certainty about
their observations if they hear that other wit-
nesses have made similar, substantiating claims.
This factor is noteworthy because it undermines
the notion that an incident involving multiple
witnesses is necessarily more credible than an
event involving only one witness. If three wit-
nesses thought they saw BlGFOOT, and a fourth
is pretty sure that what he saw was just a bear,
the loner is likely to lose confidence in his per-
ception and to change it to agree with that of his
companions.
Avoidance of saying “I don ’t know. ” Witnesses
are reluctant to admit ignorance or inability to re-
call, and will sometimes invent details in order to
avoid saying “I don’t know” (Buckhout, 1974).
This factor is important to consider in devising a
proper interview of a witness. Reports in which
the witness is prompted with questions tend to be
NATIVE AND WESTERN EYEWITNESS TESTIMONY IN CRYPTOZOOLOGY xxxix
more detailed but less accurate, because much of
the detail is unconsciously invented.
Significance of the detail or event. Witnesses
usually remember “important” things and forget
“trivial” things (Buckhout, 1974; Williams et ah,
1992). If an armed robber orders a bank teller to
surrender the contents of the cash drawer, the
teller’s attention may be so fixed upon the gun
that he does not at the time notice, nor does he
later recall, the color of the bandit’s eyes. The de-
tail simply isn’t important to the witness in the
context of the event (although it may become
very important later, in identifying the criminal) .
Likewise, a witness confronted by a big, un-
known, possibly fierce animal is very likely to
overlook subtle field marks.
Age. Witnesses may be more or less reliable
depending on their age. For various physiologi-
cal and psychological reasons, the elderly and
children are generally less reliable than young
and middle-aged adults (Buckhout, 1974; Dent
and Stephenson, 1979).
The elderly are subject to various impair-
ments to sensory perception (cataracts, glau-
coma, hearing loss, etc.), to memory loss, and to
senile dementia, any of which can detract from
the accuracy of their observations and recollec-
tions (Dent and Stephenson, 1979).
Children are more vulnerable to suggestion
than are adults (Dent and Stephenson, 1979;
Williams et ah, 1992), and are more likely to fill
in missing details from imagination (Loftus,
1979). Additionally, children exhibit a near-
universal and possibly innate fear of the dark
and of “monsters” that might prowl in the dark
(Sagan, 1977). In Western cultures, this fear is
discouraged as shameful and irrational. In cul-
tures wherein children wandering unsupervised
at night might fall victim to predatory mam-
mals, venomous snakes, and other sorts of natu-
ral hazards, the “irrational” fear may be actively
encouraged, and reinforced by nightly repeti-
tions of scary folktales.
Sex. Witnesses may be more or less reliable
depending on their sex. Older studies show that
men are more reliable in all instances; more re-
cent studies show that women are more reliable
except when they are afraid or under stress
(Dent and Stephenson, 1979). Again, fear is an
important factor to consider in many cryptozo-
ological reports.
Physical condition. Witnesses may suffer from
physical ailments (near-sightedness, cataracts,
colorblindness, etc.) that affect their ability to
describe accurately what they have seen (Buck-
hout, 1974; Dent and Stephenson, 1979). Phys-
ical impairments are probably particularly im-
portant in native witnesses, many of whom may
have undiagnosed problems with their vision,
and few of whom have access to first-rate cor-
rective treatment.
Even witnesses who are free from permanent
disabilities are vulnerable to temporary physical
stresses that can affect their reliability. Long-
term lack of food or sleep, for example, can im-
pede a witness’s ability to interpret perceived
objects or events; in extreme instances, hunger
and exhaustion can cause hallucinations (Sagan,
1995).
Roy Mackal (1976) recounts a Nessie sight-
ing by H. L. Cockrell, who had spent three con-
secutive nights in a kayak trying to photograph
the monster: “Two unsuccessful night hunts led
to a third which was also unsuccessful until
dawn. At first light, a breeze had dropped and
the loch was very calm. Cockrell noticed some-
thing to his left about fifty yards away. The ob-
ject appeared to be swimming very steadily and
converging on him. . . . Cockrell said it looked
like a very large flat head that was wide and four
or five feet long. . . . He took two pictures, but
then a slight squall came up. After it was over,
he closed in on the object and found a four- foot
stick, one inch thick. ... I am quite content to
accept Cockrell’s assessment that he pho-
tographed a stick or small log and assume that a
combination of fatigue from three nights’ activ-
ity on Loch Ness and a tremendous psychologi-
cal bias of belief and expectation produced the
recorded experience.”
Training. Witnesses with training in fields
that require accurate observation often recall de-
scriptive details better than untrained witnesses;
witnesses with such training may also be less
prone to suggestion (Williams et ah, 1992). The
reported findings deal with policemen observing
humans and their activities. I submit that a sim-
ilar situation may exist with trained zoologists,
experienced hunters, or even avid birdwatchers,
observing animals and their activities. Natives
who rely on their local animals and plants for
sustenance obviously have more relevant train-
xl NATIVE AND WESTERN EYEWITNESS TESTIMONY IN CRYPTOZOOLOGY
ing than the average Western suburbanite, and
this factor must be considered in any evaluation
of native testimony.
Biased interviewing. Witnesses are extremely
subject to influence by interviewers (Buckhout,
1974; Dent and Stephenson, 1979; Williams et
al., 1992). Leading questions and presentation
of photographs for comparison (“Did it look
like this?”) can warp an observer’s recollection.
Witnesses are also sensitive to nonverbal cues
that indicate the interviewer’s satisfaction or dis-
satisfaction with certain answers, and the wit-
ness may unconsciously tailor his story in order
to appear competent and helpful to the ques-
tioner (Buckhout, 1974).
Factors Affecting Reliability
of Native Eyewitness Testimony
In addition to the aforementioned factors that
apply to analysis of any eyewitness testimony, I
suggest a few others that apply primarily to the
testimony of natives:
Language barrier. The description a native
gives is only as good as his command of English,
your command of his language, or your inter-
preter’s command of both languages. In any
translation, errors can occur.
Alternative taxonomies. Native peoples have
their own classification schemes for animals and
plants. Their methods of categorization are
sometimes very different from our own
(Durkheim and Mauss, 1963; Levi-Strauss,
1966). Ours is based on common descent —
which, until the very recent introduction of
DNA analysis, has been evaluated primarily by
physical similarity. Other cultures’ taxonomies
are based on the ways in which animals are used
(deer and alligators might be grouped together,
because they both furnish leather); on the time
of day when animals are active (bats and owls
might be grouped together, because they are
both active at night); or on where the animal
lives (parrots and monkeys might be grouped to-
gether, because they both dwell in trees). When
a native says, “The animal is in the family of the
crocodile and the monitor lizard,” he may not be
indicating the fact that the animal is large and
reptilian, but rather some native taxonomic sim-
ilarity — the fact that, like a crocodile or monitor
lizard, it lives near the water; or the fact that, like
a crocodile or monitor lizard, it is eaten by the
locals. Language barriers can amplify misunder-
standings of this sort.
Overconfidence on the part of the witness in his
own expertise. I’ve personally encountered this
problem in talking with hunters and outdoors-
men in the United States. I believe it may be
common to hunters and outdoorsmen in all cul-
tures — and, of course, it would be more preva-
lent in cultures wherein a greater proportion of
the population are outdoorsmen. Witnesses
with extensive experience in the woods convince
themselves that when they encounter an animal
they’ve not seen before, the animal must be
something extraordinary and alien — because,
after X number of years in the woods, surely the
witness knows every animal out there. In the
mind of the witness, unknown to him means
unknown period. This assumption is likely to be
false especially among native people for a num-
ber of reasons.
1 . In any region, there are bound to be
known animals so rare or secretive that even
an experienced hunter could go an entire
lifetime without seeing them once.
2. Native peoples usually have limited access
to electricity, flashlights, batteries, etc., and
their nighttime foraging activities are there-
fore restricted; many nocturnal animals
could escape notice for generations.
3. Native peoples frequently have no written
language, and have limited access to televi-
sion, books, the Internet, and other infor-
mation resources; so they have no way of
learning about wildlife except by direct ex-
perience or by word of mouth. While a na-
tive hunter may have fantastically thorough
knowledge of the wildlife within a few days’
walk from his village, he may at the same
time be largely ignorant of animals found
only 100 miles away. What happens when,
due to some unusual circumstance, a lone
specimen of some strange-looking animal
wanders from its accustomed range? Some-
one with access to the Discovery Channel
would say, “Oh. That’s a rhino. I’ve seen
those on TV. What’s it doing here?” A na-
tive hunter might well believe he’s seen a
monster, and might have great difficulty de-
scribing a creature so completely foreign to
his experience.
NATIVE AND WESTERN EYEWITNESS TESTIMONY IN CRYPTOZOOLOGY xli
Incomplete separation of science , history ,
In our society, science, history, religious
allegory, and fictional entertainment are fairly
distinct. Individuals who fail to recognize the
distinctions are in the minority, and are gener-
ally held in scorn. In native cultures, however,
the lines between these different sorts of infor-
mation are blurred — when, indeed, there are
lines at all (Levi- Strauss, 1978). Lack of a writ-
ten language almost assures distortion of infor-
mation as it gets passed orally from generation
to generation.
Skepticism is encouraged in Western scien-
tific tradition — even the most fundamental prin-
ciples of science are periodically questioned and
subjected to testing (Hawking, 1988). Skepti-
cism is discouraged in native societies, wherein
unquestioning acceptance of inherited tradition
and wisdom is a virtue (Levi- Strauss, 1978). Be-
lief in monsters, never actually seen but fre-
quently talked about, therefore seems likelier in
native cultures than in Western cultures — and,
as previously discussed, belief profoundly affects
eyewitnesses by creating expectancy.
Dijferent attitudes toward sense data. In West-
ern society, we are encouraged through formal
education to recognize the fallibility of our
senses. Observation is the beginning of the
process that leads to proof; observation alone
does not constitute proof. This mode of
thought, however, is unnatural, counterintu-
itive, and only recently developed. For peoples
who rely heavily on their keen eyesight or acute
hearing to secure food and to avoid dangers, see-
ing is believing Observation is proof (Levi-
Strauss, 1978).
The Bottom Line
In evaluating eyewitness testimony from any-
one, from any culture, always consider the limi-
tations of human perception and memory. Al-
ways consider how your questions may affect
the witness’s recollection. And always ask your-
self: Which is more likely — that the incident oc-
curred exactly as described? Or that the witness has
misinterpreted or misrepresented the data?
Let’s close with an illustrative anecdote. A
frightened neighbor once called upon me to res-
cue her from a cryptozoological menace in her
back yard. The creature, which she described as
a “furry lobster, about two feet long,” had been
on her patio when she first encountered it. In
their mutual fear, both furry lobster and neigh-
bor fled the scene. The furry lobster took shelter
under a shrub in the garden; my neighbor hur-
ried indoors, to telephone first the police (who
weren’t interested), and then me. I found the
mystery animal right away. It was a juvenile
Spiny-tailed iguana ( Ctenosaura sp.).
The spiny-tailed iguana is not native to
South Florida, but introduced specimens have
established breeding populations throughout
the region and the lizard is by no means un-
common here. I was not surprised to find the
animal — but I was surprised at the woeful inac-
curacy of my neighbor’s description. In no way
did this lizard resemble a lobster; in no way was
it furry; and its total length was about one foot,
half the size reported. What further distortions
might have been introduced if I’d heard the re-
port a year after the incident? If the report had
been imperfectly translated from another lan-
guage? If I’d shown the witness pictures of ani-
mals approximately matching the “furry lob-
ster” description? If I’d asked her to draw for me
what she’d seen? And how might my perception
of the report have been different if the event had
taken place not in suburban Miami, but in un-
charted Amazonia?
Sorry to disappoint anyone who’s been on
the trail of the Florida Furry Lobster. To the rest
of you, happy hunting.

GEOLOGIC TIMESCALE
This chart divides the last 545 million
years of earth history into named intervals
of geological time, many of which are
referred to in this book. The three major
eras (Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic)
are subdivided into the periods shown on
the left (Cambrian, Ordovician, and so
on), from the oldest at the top to the
present time at the bottom. Note that this
consists of only the last 12% of earth’s
4.6-billion-year history.
Time is given in millions of years ago
(my a), with the boundaries of each period
on the left and a graduated scale on the
right. There are three different scales: 50-
million-year markers for the Paleozoic
and Mesozoic, 10-million-year markers
for the Cenozoic, and .5 -million-year
markers for the Quaternary.
Notable milestones in the history of
life are listed on the right.

Defining the Field
The word cryptozoology (in French, “la crypto-
zoologie”) was coined by Bernard Heuvelmans
in the late 1950s. It comes from the Greek
kryptos (“hidden”) + zoon (“animal”) + logos
(“discourse”), which when combined yield “the
science of hidden animals.” More accurately,
cryptozoology is the study of the evidence for
animals that are undescribed by science. The
word first appeared in print in 1959 when
Chief Game Inspector of the French Overseas
Territories Lucien Blancou dedicated his book
Geographic cynegetique du monde to Heuvel-
mans: “Bernard Heuvelmans, maitre de la cryp-
tozoologie” (Bernard Heuvelmans, master of
cryptozoology). Heuvelmans has also credited
Ivan T. Sanderson with inventing the word in-
dependently when Sanderson was a student,
which would have been at Eton College in the
1920s.
The use of the word cryptid for unknown an-
imals was proposed by John E. Wall of Altona,
Manitoba, in a summer 1983 letter to ISC
Newsletter.
Dracontology , now in use for the study of
both Freshwater Monsters and Sea Mon-
sters, was coined by French Canadian Jacques
Boisvert in the early 1980s. It was accepted by
f Office de la Langue Franchise du Quebec (as
dracontologie) in 1984 and by the American Her-
itage Dictionary in 1985.
The term hominology was invented by Rus-
sian researcher Dmitri Bayanov in the early
1970s to describe the study of existing Ho-
MINIDS that do not belong to our own species,
Homo sapiens. In a letter to primatologist John
Napier in 1973, Bayanov said the term was in-
tended to “bridge the gap between zoology and
anthropology.”

MYSTERIOUS
CREATURES
VOLUME I : A-M
A
Abnauayu
Wildman of West Asia.
Etymology: Abkhaz (Northwest Caucasian),
“forest man” or “shy boy.”
Variant names: Bnahua (Abaza/Northwest
Caucasian), Ochokochi (Mingrelian/Caucasian) .
Physical description: Covered with reddish-
black hair. Dark skin. Thick head-hair that
hangs down the back like a mane. Low fore-
head. Eyes with a reddish tinge. Flat nose. High
cheekbones. Enormous teeth. Muscular arms
and legs. Females have large breasts and but-
tocks. Fingers long and thick. Splayed feet.
Behavior: Skilled runner and swimmer. No
speech but makes muttering noises. Sharp sense
of hearing. Food includes grapes, hominy, and
meat. Sleeps in a hole in the ground. Can ap-
parently breed successfully with humans.
Washes newborn infants in cold-water springs.
Uses improvised weapons of sticks and stones.
Habitually plays with stones, grinding and
smashing them.
Distribution: Caucasus Mountains, Abkhazia
Autonomous Republic, Georgia.
Significant sighting: A female Abnauayu, nick-
named “Zana,” was captured in the mid-nine-
teenth century, possibly in Ajaria, Georgia. The
nobleman Edgi Genaba took her to his farm
near Tkhina in Abkhazia, where she lived until
her death in the 1880s or 1890s. At first, she
was kept shackled in a strong enclosure; later, as
she became tame, Zana was let loose to wander
about. She was trained to do simple tasks such
as grinding grain and fetching firewood. Zana
was survived by two sons and two daughters fa-
thered by local human males; these offspring
grew up and became relatively normal citizens.
Two of Zana’s grandchildren were interviewed
by Boris Porshnev in 1964. (One of them, Sha-
likula, was said to have been able to pick up a
chair, along with a man sitting on it, with his
teeth.) Zana’s grave has not been found, but the
skeleton of her son Khwit has been exhumed;
the skull combines “modern and ancient fea-
tures,” according to a 1987 Russian study.
Grover Krantz had an opportunity to examine
Khwit’s skull, and he says it is a modern Homo
sapiens y though with slightly stronger jaws and
flaring cheekbones.
Possible explanations:
(1) Neanderthal ( Homo neanderthalensis)
sites are known at Sakhazia and Dzhruchula
in Georgia. The large teeth and low forehead
are characteristic of these West Asian and
European hominids.
(2) Zana’s ability to breed successfully with
modern humans is intriguing, to say the
least, and makes it more likely that she rep-
resents an anatomically modern human with
some archaic retentions, particularly with re-
gard to lifestyle and material culture.

Abominable Snowman
English name for the Yeti of Central Asia.
Etymology: Coined by Calcutta Statesman
columnist Henry Newman in 1921 as a transla-
tion of the Sherpa (Sino-Tibetan) METOH-
KANGMI, which a telegraphist miscoded as
“Metch kangmi.” Newman claimed it meant
“abominable snowman.” The phrase became a
popular term with journalists from the 1920s
through the 1960s. The name does not come
from the creature’s supposed horrible odor, as
some have alleged. The term also serves as a
generic name for unknown Asian hominids.
Variant names: ABSM, Snowman.
Physical description: See YETI.
Distribution: Himalaya Mountains of Nepal
and Tibet.

humaines dAfrique (Paris: Plon, 1980), p. 496.
ABSM
See Abominable Snowman.
Etymology: Ivan T. Sanderson’s initialism for
Abominable Snowman, which he used as a
generic name for any unknown PRIMATE or Ho-
MINID.
Source: Ivan T. Sanderson, Abominable
Snowmen: Legend Come to Life (Philadelphia:
Chilton, 1961).
Abyssal Rainbow Gar
One of Beebe’s Abyssal Fishes of the North
Atlantic Ocean.
Physical description: Length, 4 inches. Scarlet
head. Long beak. Blue body. Yellow tail.
Behavior: Abyssal. Swims with a stiff, upright
posture.
Distribution: North Atlantic Ocean.
Significant sighting: Observed only once at
2,500 feet by William Beebe in a bathysphere
off Bermuda in the early 1930s.
Source: William Beebe, Half Mile Down
(New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1934).
Acorn Worm (Giant)
Undiscovered marine INVERTEBRATE.
Physical description: Adult Acorn worms
(Class Enteropneusta) of the type Planctosphaera
pelagica have never been observed. The larvae
(tornariae) are larger than those of other hemi-
chordates, and if the size ratio is the same as in
other species, the adults could grow to 9 feet
long. The larvae are large, transparent spheres
with arborescently branched, ciliated feeding
bands and a U-shaped alimentary tract.
Habitat: Oceanic mud at depths of 250-
1,660 feet.
Distribution: Eastern North Atlantic and
North Pacific Oceans.
Possible explanation: The larvae may be the
abnormally enlarged tornariae of another family
of Acorn worms (Ptychoderidae) that fail to
metamorphose into adults.

Variant names: Adam-japayis, Adam-yapay-
isy, Adam-yavei, Japayi-kishi, Zhabayi-adam
(Kazakh/T urkic) .
Distribution: Eastern Pamir Mountains,

Etymology: Tamahaq (Berber) name.
Variant names: Kelb-el-khela (“bushdog,” in
Mauritania), Tarhsit (for the female).
Physical description: Like a wolf.
Distribution: Sahara Desert.
Possible explanation: An African wild dog (Ly-
caon pictus) outside its usual range. These dogs
stand up to 2 feet 7 inches at the shoulder and
are normally found in protected sub-Saharan sa-
vanna areas. Earlier in the twentieth century,
there may have been enough gazelles in sub-
desert areas for scattered packs to subsist.

giant beaver or crocodile.
Behavior: Causes flooding. Drags people into
the water.

AFANC 5
Afonya
Giant Hominid of Northern Europe.
Etymology: Six Russian teenagers gave a large,
hairy hominid this nickname, which is a
diminutive of the Russian name Afanasii; how-
ever, the term may be derived from the name of
a popular 1975 Russian film about a drunken
Soviet plumber.
Physical description: Height, 7-8 feet. Body-
hair mostly light gray with lighter and darker
patches. Dark skin. Round head. Wide fore-
head. Face wrinkled. Reddish eyes, set wide
apart. Arms hang to the knees. Light-colored
buttocks.
Behavior: Primarily nocturnal. Stooped-over
stance. Sometimes knuckle-walks. Runs very
quickly and smoothly. Climbs trees with some
agility. Call is a mooing sound. May live in cab-
ins when they are deserted. May steal dogs for
hunting or companionship. Throws rocks and
sticks as weapons.
Tracks: Length, 15 inches. Stride measures
over 4 feet.
Distribution: Kola Peninsula, European Russia.
Significant sightings: A group of teenagers on
a fishing expedition to Lake Lovozero in the
Murmansk Region of Russia were pestered in
their cabin and chased for several days in August
and September 1988 by an aggressive creature
they nicknamed “Afonya.” It was also seen by a
local game warden. Maya Bykova and a team of
researchers visited the area shortly afterward and
succeeded in catching a glimpse of Afonya.
They returned the following summer and un-
covered tracks, hair, feces, and additional testi-
mony. Bykova developed a specific call that
Afonya responded to and answered, and she was
able to entice it to the cabin where the teenagers
had stayed. Her assistant, Nikolai Damilin, used
a different call equally successfully. The team
carried out experiments using tape recordings of
animal sounds that included the calls of pri-
mates. One of the creatures went to the cabin in
response to the sounds and left footprints.
Strange whistling was recorded several times
and analyzed by Leonid Yershov.

Agatch-Kishi
Wildman of West Asia.
Etymology: Karachay-Balkar (Turkic), “wild
man.”
Distribution: Caucasus Mountains, Russia.
Source: Dmitri Bayanov, In the Footsteps of
the Russian Snowman (Moscow: Crypto-Logos,

Agogwe
Small Hominid of East Africa.
Etymology: Kuria or Chagga (Bantu) word.
Physical description: Height, about 4 feet.
Brown or russet-colored hair.
Behavior: Upright gait. Said to barter for
goods with local tribes.
Habitat: Dense forests.
Distribution: North-central Tanzania.
Significant sighting: William Hichens briefly
observed two hairy men in north-central Tanza-
nia in the 1920s. They walked upright across a
clearing in the forest.
Possible explanation: Surviving gracile aus-
tralopith, suggested by Bernard Heuvelmans.
( See Kakundakari for a more detailed explana-
tion.) The Laetoli fossil beds that contain per-
fectly preserved Australopithecus afarensis foot-
prints are in north-central Tanzania, as is
Olduvai Gorge where the robust fossil Paran-
thropus boisei was discovered by Louis Leakey in
1959. Since East Africa is the probable birth-
place of early hominid species, its traditions of
small hairy men are tantalizing.

by claws. Batlike wings. Wingspan, 11-12 feet.
Feet said to point backward.
Behavior: Nocturnal. Squats on the forest
floor with its wings pressed against its flanks.
Flies low over rivers in search of fishes. Call is
“AH-OOooool,” repeated three times. Said to
kill people with its claws.
Distribution: Mountains in the western part
of Java.
Significant sighting: Ernst Bartels was sleeping
near Cijengkol, Java, Indonesia, in 1927 when
he was awakened by the sound of flapping wings
and the call of an animal that sounded like “a-
hool.”
Possible explanation: An unknown large bat
with an enormous wingspan, possibly a micro-
bat, suggested by Karl Shuker.

Ahuitzotl
Legendary OTTER-like animal of Mexico.
Etymology: Nahuatl (Uto-Aztecan), “water
dog.”
Physical description: Looks like a small dog.
Smooth, black coat. Small, pointed ears. Paws
like a raccoon’s. A bony spur projects underneath
its tail. Tip of the tail looks like a human hand.
Behavior: Amphibious. Makes a sound like a
baby crying. Said to drag humans into the water
with its tail.
Habitat: Rivers or lakes.
Distribution: Mexico.
Present status: Known to the Aztecs but prob-
ably extinct now.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Coyote ( Canis latranf), suggested by
Ferdinand Anders. However, coyotes do not
like water.
(2) The Mexican hairy porcupine ( Coendu
mexicanus ), proposed by Eduard Seler,
though this is an arboreal animal, not an
aquatic one.
(3) The Marine otter ( Lontra felina ), al-
though it is only found on the Pacific coast
from Peru to Tierra del Fuego.
(4) The Sea otter ( Enhydra lutris ), but it
does not range farther south than California.
(5) The Neotropical otter ( Lontra
longicaudis) , which is found in rivers
throughout much of Mexico. Except for the
odd tail and aggressive manner, this would
be an excellent candidate. Andrew Gable
writes that the Aztecs knew this otter as the
Aitzcuintli; however, the Nahuatl name for
the Domestic dog ( Canis familiaris) was
Itzcuintli, so there may be differing interpre-
tations in Aztec texts.
(6) An unknown species of prehensile-tailed
otter, proposed by Andrew Gable.

Asian leopards and American jaguars.
Behavior: Attacks livestock.
Distribution: Most common in Great Britain
(see BRITISH Big Cat). Scattered reports occur
throughout Europe. Its existence in the British
Isles especially seems unlikely from an ecological
standpoint. A partial list of European places
where Alien big cats have been reported follows:
Czech Rep u blic — J inac o vice .
Denmark — Meldungen.
Finland — Imatra, Kekaleenmaki, Kristines-
tad, Ruokolahti, Vaasa.
France — Cezallier; Epinal, Vosges Depart-
ment; Esterel; Foret de Chize, near Niort; Noth,
Creuse Department; Pindray near Poitiers; Por-
nic, Brittany Region; Valescure.
Germany — Bruchmiihlbach-Miesau, Deggen-
dorf, Erding, Ernsdorf, Fiirth, Gelnhausen,
Hannover, Heubach, Kalbach, Lindenfels,
Odenwald, Rantrum, Saarland State, Schwal-
bach, Soest, Steinbach, Winterkasten.
Italy — Bari, Foggia.
Switzerland — Graubiinden.
Significant sightings: Some 289 sheep and 3
cows were killed from February to November
1977 around Epinal, Vosges Department,
France, by big cats or dogs with eyes like a lynx’s
and fur like a wolf s. In the summer of 1978, at
least two animals that had survived the winter
were seen by various witnesses, who described
them as large and black with short legs and big
paws. The animals disappeared from the region
in 1979.
In July 1982, Uwe Sander of Rantrum,
Schleswig-Holstein State, Germany, claimed to
have been attacked by a puma rumored to be at
large north of Hamburg. Hunters and police of-
ficers searched the area to no avail. Sander ob-
tained some hair from the animal, but analysis
showed it had come from a rabbit.
A lionlike cat the size of a calf terrorized the
area around Noth, Creuse Department, central
France, in November and December 1982,
killing cattle and sheep.
Black panthers were sighted in the Oden-
wald, Hesse State, Germany, in August 1989
and near Heubach, Hesse State, in October of
the same year. In the first two days of Novem-
ber, several people reported panther encounters
in Fiirth, Steinbach, Winterkasten, and Linden-
fels. However, few tracks were found, no do-
mestic animals were killed, and organized hunts
yielded nothing.
On June 22, 1992, forestry official Martti
Arvinen encountered a golden-brown lioness in
the wilderness near Ruokolahti, Finland. The
animal turned and ran. Numerous tracks were
found, as well as the half-eaten carcass of a
young moose (called an “elk” in Europe). So
many other sightings in Finland took place over
the next week that the newspapers nicknamed
the animal “Elli.”
Possible explanations:
(1) Leopards ( Panthera pardus) were com-
mon from Africa to Indonesia before their
ALIEN BIG CAT 9
range began to shrink around 1800. They
are still found in forested and rocky areas of
Africa and East Asia. Melanism (black col-
oration caused by a recessive gene) is most
common in India and Southeast Asia. Spots
are still present but rendered less visible by
the dark pigment. Males can measure 8 feet
in total length and weigh up to 200 pounds.
They are lone, nocturnal hunters, stalking
their prey and killing swiftly with a bite to
the throat.
(2) Lions ( Panthera led) lived in Southern
and Eastern Europe from 700,000 years ago
to around A.D. 100. Upper Paleolithic cave
art, particularly that in Grotte Chauvet in
France, features them in surprising detail,
down to the black dots at the base of the
whiskers. None are depicted as maned, lead-
ing some to speculate that European male
lions were maneless; however, cave artists
may have favored the dominant females of
the pride.
(3) The much smaller American Jaguar
C Panthera onca ), found from Mexico to Ar-
gentina, is also prone to melanism.
(4) The Puma ( Puma concolor ) is only found
in North and South America. Eradicated in
the eastern United States by the early twen-
tieth century, it is now making a comeback
(see Eastern Puma). It ranges from light to
dark brown in color and has no spots.
Melanism is virtually unknown. The average
length is 6-8 feet (including tail), and the
animal is about 3 feet high at the shoulder.
It is wary of humans and avoids contact. Its
normal prey is deer, but it also eats fishes,
rabbits, and game birds.
(5) The European wildcat (Felis silvestris sil-
vestris) has been making a comeback in cer-
tain areas, particularly Switzerland, Belgium,
the Czech Republic, Slovakia, France, and
Germany.
(6) The Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) was rein-
troduced in eastern Switzerland, Austria, and
Slovenia in the 1970s and has reoccupied
about two-thirds of the Swiss Alps. Like the
European wildcat, this smaller animal could
be mistaken for a big cat from a distance.
(7) The Gray wolf ( Canis lupus) is still found
in the wilder parts of Europe, but it is so
well known that misidentifications are un-
likely.
(8) Paranormal ENTITIES without a zoologi-
cal basis, perhaps having a psychic nature.

Alien Big Dog
The Dog equivalent of Europe’s ALIEN Big
Cat. Some livestock-ravaging cryptids have a
decidedly canid look, though in most respects
they behave similarly to the mystery cats.
Variant names: Beast OF GEVAUDAN, Girt
dog, Island monster (Isle of Wight), PHANTOM
WOLF, Vectis monster (Isle of Wight).
Physical description: Like a large dog but with
certain peculiar features. Dark color. Small ears.
Long snout. Short legs. Long tail.
Behavior: Kills livestock but often only drinks
the blood instead of eating the animal.
Tracks: Clawed.
Distribution: England; Ireland; Serbia; Rus-
sia.
Significant sightings: An unknown animal
killed as many as seven or eight sheep each night
by cutting their throats and drinking their blood
near Ennerdale Water, Cumbria, England, from
May to September 1810. Will Rotherby, who
was knocked down by the beast, described it as
10 ALIEN BIG DOG
lionlike, though most observers thought it a
dog. A dog was killed on September 12, after
which the killings stopped.
A mystery animal killed sheep, as many as
thirty in one night, from January to April 1874,
in County Cavan, Ireland, and later near Lim-
erick. Throats were cut and blood sucked, but
the sheep were not eaten.
From July to December 1893, a dog-sized an-
imal with a long snout and a long tail attacked
women and children near Trosna, Orel Region,
Russia. At least one child and two women were
said to have been killed. Repeated attempts by
hunters to shoot or capture the animal failed,
though it apparently ate some poisoned sheep
set as bait and disappeared beyond the Vytebet’
River. In fact, more than one beast may have
been involved, possibly a big cat and a smaller
dog.
In November 1905, a mystery animal killed
sheep in the area around Great Badminton,
South Gloucestershire, England, leaving the
flesh almost untouched, but the blood had been
lapped up.
A lion-headed, maned, hairless mystery ani-
mal on the Isle of Wight, England, was killed in
1940; it turned out to be a fox in an advanced
state of mange.
A dog the size of a small pony was seen on
Dartmoor, Devon, England, by policeman John
Duckworth in 1969 and 1972.
In the mid-1990s, a pair of unusual animals
was killed near Slatina, 9 miles southeast of
Cacak in Serbia. Slightly bigger than pit bulls,
they had short legs, long snouts, and no tails.
They had been killing chickens and livestock
and drinking their blood. A similar animal was
killed near Mala Kopasnica, about 100 miles to
the southeast.
Near Gornja Gorevnica, Serbia, in November
2000, many sheep were found killed by an ani-
mal that made a tiny incision in their necks and
drank their blood. More than 150 hunters went
to Jelica Mountain to hunt for the beast, but they
found nothing. Some thought that North At-
lantic Treaty Organization (NATO) forces had
introduced predators to destroy Serbian livestock.
In the summer of 2001, a mystery animal
killed as many as ten sheep a night in the region
around Novi Knezevac, Serbia. Sheep weighing
as much as 200 pounds were found slaughtered,
and the guard dogs remained silent.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Gray wolf ( Canis lupus) has been ex-
tinct in England since i486, in Scotland
since 1743, and in Ireland since about 1770.
Russia has always been a stronghold for wolf
populations, which have actually increased
since World War II. Attacks on people by
wolves are extremely rare, except for the oc-
casional rabid specimen. In the twentieth
century, the only evidence for such attacks
involved some unconfirmed reports from
Italy that wolves had attacked and killed un-
accompanied young children. In the absence
of natural wild prey, wolves will go after
livestock, especially in the winter. Sheep,
carrion, and domestic dogs were found to be
their most frequent prey, according to one
study in Spain.
(2) A feral Domestic dog ( Canis familiaris ),
especially a hound or other large breed or
crossbreed.
(3) Wolf x dog hybrids occur more fre-
quently as wolf populations become more
isolated. Hybrids have been reported
throughout Southern Europe.
(4) Arctic foxes ( Alopex lagopus) turned up in
Yorkshire, England, in 1983 and North
Wales in 1990.
(5) A few Coyote cubs ( Canis latrans) are
said to have been introduced around 1881
in Epping Forest, Essex, England.
(6) A giant variety of Pine marten ( Martes
martes ), suggested by Andrew Gable.

Almas
WlLDMAN of Central Asia.
Etymology: Mongolian (Altaic), “wild man,”
though possibly derived from ala (“to kill”) +
mal (“animals”). The word is found in many
southern Mongolian place-names.
Variant names: Albast, Albasty, Alboost, Al-
mast (Kazakh/Turkic), Habisun mortu (“edge-
wise going”), KHUN Goruessu, Niihni almas
(“burrow” almas), Zagin almas (“saxaul” almas),
Zagitmegen (“old woman of the saxaul thickets”).
Physical description: Adult height, 5 feet— 6
feet 6 inches. Covered with 6-inch-long, curly,
reddish-brown hair except for hands and face.
Dark skin. Prominent browridges. Small, flat
nose. Pronounced cheekbones. Jutting jaw. No
chin. Short neck. Females have pendulous
breasts. Long arms. Long fingers. Short thumb.
Fingernails and toenails present. Bare, callused
knees. Short legs. Broad feet. Big toe shorter
than others but massive and projecting inward.
Behavior: Walks with knees bent and legs
spread apart (at least in snow). Females throw
breasts over their shoulders when running. Said
to be able to outrun camels. No known lan-
guage but can produce some bloodcurdling
shrieks. Eats grass, wild plants, and perhaps
small mammals. Lives in caves. Possibly engages
in primitive barter with humans (will leave skins
at prearranged places and pick up items left by
the nomads) and may interbreed with them (a
lama at the Lamaiin Gegeenii Hiiryee
Monastery in Mongolia was said to be a half-
breed Almas). Said to occasionally suckle
human infants. Can use only simple tools. Ap-
parently has no knowledge of fire.
The Almas, wildman of Central Asia. (Richard
Svensson/Fortean Picture Library)
Tracks: Rarely seen but slightly longer than a
human’s and much wider. No arch present.
Distribution: Altai Mountains, Mongolia;
Gobi Desert of Mongolia and Nei Mongol Au-
tonomous Region, China; Tian Shan Moun-
tains of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region,
China; Qilian Shan Mountains of Gansu and
Qinghai Provinces, China; Sayanskiy Range,
Tuva Republic, Siberian Russia.
Significant sightings: Bavarian soldier Jo-
hannes Schiltberger was captured by Turks at
the Battle of Nikopol, Bulgaria, in 1396; after
the Turks lost to Timur at the Battle of Ankara
in 1402, Schiltberger became a slave to various
Mongol warlords, migrating all the way from
Armenia to Mongolia itself and finally returning
to Europe in 1427. While in the Tian Shan
Mountains in the retinue of the Mongol prince
Egidi, he became the first Westerner to see an
Almas, two of which had been caught in the
mountains. They were covered with hair except
on their hands and faces.
Sometime in the late nineteenth century, a
caravan was resting in the southern part of the
Mongolian province of Ovorhangay on the way
12 ALMAS
to Hohhot, Nei Mongol Autonomous Region,
China, when one of the men in the party went
to collect the camels that had been set loose to
graze. When he did not return, the others went
off into the saxaul thickets to look for him. At
the entrance to a cave, they found evidence of a
struggle and figured an Almas had abducted
him. One of the elders suggested they pick him
up on the way back from Hohhot, which they
did, waiting until the creature emerged from the
cave at sundown and shooting it. The rescued
man seemed to be insane and died two months
afterward.
In April 1906, Soviet scholar Badzar Baradiin
reportedly had a brief encounter with an Almas
while he was traveling in the Gobi Desert near
Badain Jaran, Nei Mongol Autonomous Re-
gion, China. However, Michael Heaney consid-
ers this story a fiction, based on the fact that
there is no mention of the incident in Baradiin’s
meticulous diary of the trip; moreover, the ac-
tual route was 150 miles east of where the event
supposedly took place.
A seven-year-old Almas female was acciden-
tally killed in the Gobi when she set off a cross-
bow attached to an animal snare. Many people
in the sparsely populated area are said to have
seen the body, but the locals begged investiga-
tors not to talk about it, since crossbow snares
were illegal.
In 1927, travelers left a caravan unattended
while they went to look for a camel that had
dropped back. Upon their return at daybreak,
they found several Almas warming themselves
by the dying campfire. The creatures had eaten
some dried dates and sweets but had left the jars
of wine untouched.
A monk named Dambayorin was traveling
across the Gobi in 1930 when he saw a naked
child in the distance. When he got closer, he
saw it was covered with red hair, realized it was
an Almas, and fled in terror.
An entire skin of an Almas is said to have
hung in the temple of the monastery at Baruun
Hural, Mongolia, in 1937. It had humanlike legs
and arms and long hair hanging from its head.
The Almas had been killed in the Gobi by the
hunter Mangal Durekchi and given to the lamas.
A Mongolian pharmacist named Nagmit was
in the mountains with two Kazakhs when they
came upon an Almas. They shouted at it, offer-
ing it food and clothing, but it kept its distance.
When they shot at it, intentionally missing, the
creature merely seemed curious, then departed.
Russian pediatrician Ivan Ivlov was traveling
in the Altai Mountains of western Mongolia in
1963 when he saw a male, a female, and a young
Almas on a mountain slope. He observed them
through binoculars at a distance of about a mile
until they moved out of sight. Afterward, he
queried a number of his child patients about the
Almas and obtained some detailed stories.
Present status: Vanished or severely reduced
over much of its range.
Possible explanations:
(1) Surviving Homo erectus , suggested by
Mark Hall and Loren Coleman. The nearest
known fossils are the Zhoukoudian Peking
man remains found north of Beijing in the
1920s. The browridge, flat nose, absent
chin, and robust jaw match Almas descrip-
tions. H. erectus used a primitive
(Acheulean) toolkit of hand axes and other
bifacial stone tools. The youngest level of
erectus remains at Zhoukoudian date from
about 300,000 years ago.
(2) Surviving Neanderthals ( Homo nean-
derthalensis) , proposed by Myra Shackley.
Neanderthal fossils are not known in Cen-
tral Asia, though Shackley claims to have re-
covered, in Mongolia, Mousterian tools nor-
mally associated with them. Almas
descriptions seem to indicate a more primi-
tive morphology than known Neanderthal
fossils, so Shackley has also theorized that
they may represent a common ancestor to
Neanderthals and modern humans.

Almas ti
Wildman of West Asia.
Etymology: Kabardian (Circassian) word, said
to mean “forest man.” Seemingly derivative of
the Mongolian ALMAS; possibly borrowed from
the Mongolian-speaking Kalmyks to the north
in Kalmykia.
Variant names: Almasty, Gubganana (for the
female).
Physical description: Height, 5-6 feet. Weight,
up to 500 pounds. Reddish, shaggy body-hair.
Long, tangled head-hair. Slanted and reddish
eyes. Flattened nose. Prominent cheekbones.
Receding lower jaw. Females have breasts.
Short, bowed legs. Splayed feet. Babies are al-
legedly born pink and hairless but are covered in
short hair by the age of one.
Behavior: Active primarily at dusk and at
night; sleeps in the daytime. Seen most fre-
quently in July and August. Often mumbles.
Call is a cry of tremendous power. Extremely
bad smell. Omnivorous but primarily vegetar-
ian, liking grasses, especially hemp and corn,
and melons and cherries. Also known to eat
frogs, lizards, rats, horse dung (possibly for the
salt content), and the placenta of domestic ani-
mals. Rests in chance refuges in the winter
(empty cabins, barns) and makes nests of weeds,
rags, leaves, and grass in the summer. Has been
observed braiding horse’s manes. Sometimes
wears tattered clothing around the waist, appar-
ently acquired from local people.
Habitat: Remote mountains and woodlands.
Distribution: The Russian Caucasus Moun-
tains, from Abkhazia in Georgia and the
Kabardin-Balkar Republic in the west, south to
Armenia, and east through the Dagestan Re-
public to Azerbaijan.
Significant sightings: Erjib Koshokoyev and
other policemen nearly trapped a female in a
hemp field in the Caucasus Mountains south of
Nal’chik in October 1944.
In 1956, N. Ya. Serikova was staying at a col-
lective farm in the Zolsk area of the Kabardin-
Balkar Republic, Russia. She was listening to the
sounds of a wedding party next door when an
Almasti came into the room, screeched twice,
and left the hut, slamming the door behind it.
Apparently, it frequented a nearby house, where
an old woman had befriended it.
Russian researcher Marie-Jeanne Kofman
found a set of tracks in the Dolina Narzanov
Valley in the north Caucasus in March 1978.
While he remained hidden in a barn in Ku-
ruko ravine, Kabardin-Balkar Republic, Russia,
on August 25, 1991, biologist Gregory
Panchenko observed an Almasti enter through a
window and plait a horse’s mane. The horse did
not offer any resistance. After a short time, dur-
ing which it made high-pitched, twittering
sounds, the Almasti departed through an open
window above the barn door. Panchenko veri-
fied that the horse’s mane had new and clumsily
plaited braids that were not there the day before.
In the summer of 1992, French filmmaker
Sylvain Pallix and Marie-Jeanne Kofman orga-
14 ALMASTI
nized an expedition to the Kabardin-Balkar Re-
public under the auspices of the Russian Society
of Cryptozoology to investigate recent Almasti
reports. Although the organizers had a falling
out, the French team managed to get some
fieldwork done with the help of Kabardinian
teacher Muaed Mysyrjan. Eyewitness Doucha
Apsikova took the team to the place where she
had seen an Almasti only a few days previously.
Researcher Andrei Kozlov made plaster casts of
the footprints found at the site.
Possible explanations: Though not a particu-
larly rich region for fossil hominids, the area
does have Homo erectus (Dmanisi in Georgia),
archaic human (Azych in Azerbaijan), and Ne-
anderthal (Sakhazia and Dzhruchula) sites.

Alovot
Mystery Bird of Southeast Asia.
Etymology: Possibly Simeulue (Austronesian),
from ovot (“old forest”).
Physical description: Pheasant the size of a
chicken. Dark-brown plumage with lighter
spots. Small, comblike crest (perhaps only in
one sex). Short legs.
Behavior: Nocturnal. Shy and cautious. Feeds
on rice. Nests on stumps or logs. Egg is light
brown and smaller than a hen’s.
Habitat: Dense forest. Takes wing with a
heavy, low flight when surprised.
Distribution: Simeulue Island, Sumatra,
Indonesia.
Possible explanations:
(1) An unknown species of Peacock-pheas-
ant ( Polyplectron sp.), suggested by Karl
Shuker. The description resembles the
Mountain peacock-pheasant (P inopinatus ),
which lives in undisturbed mountain forests
of Malaysia.
(2) An unknown species of Gallopheasant
( Lophura sp.). The description resembles a
female Crested fireback (L. ignita ), once
common in Sumatra and Borneo. Females
are brown with white-striped underparts.

Altamaha-Ha
Freshwater Monster of Georgia.
Etymology: After the river.

AMPHIBIANS (Unknown)
The three types of animals popularly known as
amphibians are newts and salamanders (Order
Urodela), frogs and toads (Order Anura), and
caecilians (Order Gymnophiona), all belonging
to the Class Lissamphibia. They have moist
skin, no claws, and a layer of fibrous tissue that
separates the base and crown of their teeth. Each
goes through a primarily aquatic larval stage be-
fore metamorphosing into an adult. The earliest
modern amphibians arose more than 210 mil-
lion years ago in the Triassic from an earlier
group of amphibians known as lepospondyls.
The largest living amphibian is the Chinese
giant salamander ( Andrias davidianus)', one
specimen caught in Guizhou Province, China,
in 1923 measured 5 feet 9 inches along the
curve of its body. The largest frog is the rare Go-
liath frog ( Conraua goliath) from Central Africa,
which has been measured to an overall length,
with legs extended, of 34.5 inches.
Of the six mystery amphibians listed here,
three are frogs, one is a salamander, and two are
possible caecilians (wormlike, legless animals
that burrow into the soil in the tropics).

Andaman Wood Owl
Mystery Bird of Southeast Asia.
Habitat: Dense forest.
Distribution: Andaman and Nicobar Islands,
Indian Ocean.

Andaman hawk owl ( Ninox ajfinis), live on the
islands.

Andean Wolf
Unrecognized mountain Dog of South America.
Scientific name: Dasycyon hagenbecki, given by
Ingo Krumbiegel in 1949.
Physical description: Thick, blackish-brown
fur. Back hair is 8 inches long. Small, round
ears. Strong jaws. Short, solid legs. Powerful
claws.
Distribution: Andes Mountains, Argentina.
Significant sightings: In 1 927, Lorenz Hagen-
ANDEANWOLF 17
Andean WOLF pelt at the zoological museum in Munich. (Alan Pringle/ Fortean Picture Library)
beck discovered four pelts for sale in Buenos
Aires, Argentina, similar to those of a maned
wolf but thicker, darker in color, and with
smaller ears.
Ingo Krumbiegel examined an odd skull in
1935, supposedly that of a maned wolf but
larger and originating from the Andes Moun-
tains outside the animal’s range (lowlands far-
ther to the east).
Present status: A 2000 attempt at DNA analy-
sis of the remaining pelt at Munich’s zoological
museum proved unsatisfactory because it was
contaminated with human, dog, wolf, and pig
DNA. The pelt had also been chemically treated.
Possible explanation: The accidental pairing of
a Maned wolf ( Chrysocyon brachyurus) skull with
a German shepherd ( Canis familiaris) pelt.

20 ANTARCTIC LONG-FINNED WHALE
Behavior: Flies from Arabia to Egypt in the
spring. Attacked by ibises.
Significant sighting: In the fourth century
B.C., Herodotus claimed to have seen their
skeletons in large numbers at a place called Buto
between Egypt and Arabia.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Desert locust [Schistocerca gregaria)
is a large, flying grasshopper of Africa and
Asia that periodically forms massive swarms
hundreds of miles long, causing enormous
crop damage. Though each locust is only
2.25 inches long, such a swarm would leave
behind a large number of dead insects.
(2) The fossil bones of Spinosaurus , a large
theropod dinosaur of the Late Cretaceous,
95 million years ago. The type specimen was
first described in 1915 near Marsa Matruh,
Egypt, on the Mediterranean coast. Its most
striking feature is a set of dorsal spines that
probably supported a sail-like membrane.

Arizona Jaguar
Subspecies of jaguar of uncertain status in Ari-
zona.
Scientific name: Panthera onca arizonensis.
Present status: Hunted nearly to extinction by
1905, though breeding populations persisted at
least through the 1940s and probably until the
1960s. Confirmed jaguar sightings took place in
1971 (east of Nogales), 1986 (Dos Cabezas
Mountains), 1996 (Baboquivari Mountains),
and 2001 (near the Mexican border), with scat-
tered, unconfirmed reports occurring almost an-
nually. Whether this constitutes a breeding pop-
ulation or occasional stragglers from Mexico is
uncertain. The subspecies was declared endan-
gered in the United States in 1997.

Dragonlike LIZARD of Australasia.
Etymology: Papuan (Austronesian), “tree
dragon.”
Variant names: Au Angi-Angi, Kaiaimunu,
Rharhru.
Physical description: A huge lizard. Length,
12-40 feet.
Behavior: Arboreal. Said to eat humans.
Distribution: Papua New Guinea.
Significant sightings: In the 1930s, members
of the American Museum of Natural History’s
Archbold Expedition to the interior of Papua
New Guinea were told of a man-eating dragon.
Robert Grant and David George were explor-
ing the Strachan Island District in 1961 when
they encountered a gray lizard about 26 feet
long. Its neck was more than 3 feet long.
An animal captured in swampland near the
Gulf of Papua in 1980 by the Operation Drake
Expedition proved to be a juvenile specimen of
crocodile monitor. Its length has been variously
reported as 6 feet 6 inches and 7 feet 3 inches
long. One of the group’s zoologists, Ian Red-
mond, later sighted a 12-foot animal.
Possible explanation: The Crocodile monitor
( Varanus salvadorii ) has curved teeth, elongated
toes, strongly curved sharp claws, and rubbery
ARTRELLIA 21
pads on the bottom of the feet. Its long tail is up
to two and a half times the length of the head
and body. The color is black, with white speck-
les. The animal may regularly grow over 12 feet,
making it the longest lizard in the world. One
specimen was measured unofficially at 1 5 feet 7
inches, and there have been rumors of individu-
als 20 feet long.

Distribution: Lac St.-Jean, Quebec.
Significant sightings: In 1978, Marcel Tardif
and his wife saw a blackish animal, 50-60 feet
long, off Scott Point. The same day, something
overturned a canoe paddled by Michel Ver-
reault, his wife, and daughter.
Possible explanation: California sea lions (Za-
lophus calif ornianus) were released into the lake
in 1975, though these only reach 8 feet in
length.

Jules Rene Bourguignat discovered fresh bear
bones in caves in the Djurdjura Mountains, Al-
geria, in 1867 and collected stories about the
living animal from local people.
Present status: Probably extinct.
Possible explanations:
(1) A surviving small subspecies of the
Brown bear ( Ursus arctos faidherbi) that
lived in North Africa during the Pleistocene
and later. The remains of one dating from
A.D. 420-600 were found in a cave in the
Djurdjura Mountains, Algeria, in 1989.

lizards in the same area may refer to the Croco-
dile monitor {Varanus salvadorii) . SAArtrellia.
Possible explanation: Exaggerations or hoaxes
based on pictures of dinosaurs.

Auli
Unknown SlRENIAN of East and Central Africa.
Variant names: Aila, Ia-bahr-tedcha (“water
calf”), Mama fouta, Ourha-bieh.
Physical description: Size of a sheep.
Behavior: Drags its hind feet like a seal.
Distribution: Lake T’ana in Ethiopia; tribu-
taries of the Mereb Wenz, Eritrea; Lake Chad,
the Dagana Marshes, and the Ounianga Lakes
in Chad.
Significant sighting: In 1900 or 1901, Dr. Au-
guste Morel was traveling in the Dagana
marshes, Chad, with local fishermen in support
of French colonial troops pacifying the region. A
huge animal that left a tremendous disturbance
in the water nearly upset their boats. Morel
found a large area of crushed reeds but no tracks.
The locals had no idea what the animal was.
AULI 23
Possible explanations:
(1) An extended range of the West African
manatee ( Trichechus senegalensis) is possible
in Chad, though less likely in Ethiopia.
Adults are generally 9-10 feet long. The ani-
mal is found in rivers, estuaries, swamps,
and lagoons from the Senegal River in the
north to the Cuanza River, Angola, in the
south, and it occurs as far as 1,200 miles
from the sea along the Niger River. Its pres-
ence in the Chari River and Lake Chad has
been suspected but never confirmed.
(2) An unknown species of manatee or fresh-
water dugong that evolved from fossil forms
found in Egypt.

Australian Big Cat
Alien Big Cat of Australasia. Probably not a
marsupial and similar but not identical to the
leopard and puma, neither of which have been
introduced on the continent.
Variant names: Briagolong tiger (Victoria),
Brookton tiger (Western Australia), Cordering
cougar (Western Australia), Emmaville panther
(New South Wales), Jamberoo tiger (New
South Wales), Kaiapoi tiger (New Zealand),
Kangaroo Valley panther (New South Wales),
Kingstown killer (New South Wales), Marulan
tiger (New South Wales), Nightgrowler, Tal-
long tiger (New South Wales), Tanjil terror
(Victoria), Tantanoola tiger (South Australia),
Tantawanglo tiger (New South Wales), Wari-
alda cougar (New South Wales), WARRIGAL.
Physical description: There seem to be two pri-
mary Australian varieties: about 60 percent of
the incidents involve a jet-black, leopardlike cat,
while the other 30 percent describe a light-
brown felid resembling a North American
puma. The leopardlike cat is a solid jet-black
color, with powerful muscles; it is the size of a
German shepherd dog or slightly larger. The
pumalike cat is sandy-colored or fawn-gray; it is
3-4 feet long, with a tail of equal length and has
a shoulder height of 2 feet 6 inches; white bands
around the tail are occasionally seen. A maned
variety has been reported in the Blue Mountains
(WARRIGAL).
Behavior: Nocturnal. Most reports are of single
animals, with only a few involving a female and
cubs or an adult pair. Can run at great speed for
long distances. Gives out terrifying howls and
shrieks, especially at night. A solitary hunter, it
kills sheep by biting the neck or choking them,
unlike the messy kills of feral dogs or dingos. The
sheep’s internal organs and most of the bones (ex-
cept the ribs) are often consumed, either by eat-
ing through a hole in the groin or peeling the en-
tire skin back. Heavy carcasses are often moved
elsewhere before being eaten. Dogs seem particu-
larly terrified of them. Not afraid of humans or
cars.
Tracks: Four-toed. Claw marks occasionally
visible. Up to 5.5 inches in diameter. Some casts
are said to closely match puma tracks. Leaves
scratch marks in gum trees.
Distribution: Eastern New South Wales;
western Victoria; southwestern Western Aus-
tralia. Scattered reports elsewhere, including
New Zealand.
Significant sightings: Tony Healy and Paul
Cropper estimate they have collected more than
1,000 reports from 1885 to 1994 in every Aus-
tralian state except Tasmania. Two photo-
graphs, both taken in Western Australia (by
Barry Morris in 1978 and Alan Lawrence in
1982) only show silhouettes and are inconclu-
sive.
A striped animal killed many sheep in the
area around Tantanoola, South Australia, from
1893 to 1895, when an unusual-looking dog
was killed. This stuffed and not very fearsome
animal is still on display in the Tiger Hotel in
Tantanoola. Descriptions of the beast were
24 AUSTRALIAN BIG CAT
vague, and it’s uncertain whether or not a Thy-
LACINE or big cat was involved.
A large, jet-black cat was seen prowling the
hills around Jamberoo, New South Wales, in
1909.
A striped cat was held responsible for sheep
killings in the area around Marulan and Tallong,
New South Wales, between 1927 and 1930.
A big cat that could allegedly eat an adult
sheep in one sitting was investigated by Fisheries
and Game Officer Rod Estoppey near Briago-
long, Victoria, from the mid- 1930s to the mid-
1950s.
A large, black, leopardlike animal was re-
ported around Emmaville in the New England
area of New South Wales, from 1956 to 1962,
with comebacks in 1969, 1973, and 1995.
Some incidents were also reported in the region
before World War II. Known as the Emmaville
panther, it was held responsible for many noc-
turnal sheep killings. During 1956 and 1957,
some 340 sheep were killed on a single ranch
owned by Clive Berry. The case was declared
solved on at least two occasions after the killing
of a large black boar and an old hairless dingo,
but the depredations continued.
An odd carnivore was responsible for killing
many sheep near Brookton, Western Australia,
for two years in the 1960s. Hunter Harry But-
ler shot it, and it turned out to be a beat-up and
scalped dingo that had lost its tail and left de-
formed tracks.
In 1969 at Byaduk, Victoria, Les Rentsch
watched a pumalike cat with a glistening, silver-
gray coat for five to six minutes. It had two large
upper fangs.
In September 1972, George Moir of Kulja,
Western Australia, found several of his piglets
dead, with their hearts torn out and their throats
ripped open. He also watched two black animals
with long tails rounding up his sheep. Moir and
a game warden chased them for 5 miles but
could not catch them.
A black panther was seen by thirty-two wit-
nesses around Cambewarra Mountain, New
South Wales, in June 1975. Leopardlike tracks
were examined by retired naval officer Ray-
mond Noakes, and cows, dogs, chickens, goats,
and sheep were reported missing or mutilated.
A woman reported a large cat around July 10,
1977, in the Kaiapoi area, South Island, New
Zealand. Pawprints and droppings, but little
else, were found on July 21 at Pines Beach.
A large, pumalike cat has been reported near
Cordering, Western Australia, by many ranch-
ers since 1977. It apparently could kill sheep
with surgical precision. Many of them were not
eaten, but those that were had their skins peeled
back and the ribs stripped of all meat. Kanga-
roos were also found killed by puncture wounds
to the head.
Peter Bruem observed a black, leopardlike cat
and a brown, pumalike cat running together
near Bendeela, New South Wales, in the sum-
mer of 1979. He waited in the shade to see
whether they would return and they did, ap-
proaching within 100 yards.
A large, black, catlike animal was reported
frequently in the Kangaroo Valley area, New
South Wales, between 1968 and 1981. It gained
particular notoriety when it killed a valuable
pony near Budgong in June 1981. The case was
declared “solved” twice, when a feral cat (in
1977) and melanistic wallaby (in 1981) were
captured.
Norwegian zoologist Per Seglen encountered
a dark, leopardlike animal near Badgingarra Na-
tional Park, Western Australia, on August 21,
1982. It had a long, spotted or heavily striped
tail.
Large brown or black, pumalike cats have
been responsible for livestock depredations in
the Grampians Mountain Range, Victoria, since
the 1940s. Reports increased dramatically
around 1969 and remained steady though the
1970s and 1980s. Rob Wallis saw a black, mus-
cular cat near Moyston in August 1989 as it
crossed the road in front of his vehicle. He esti-
mated it was 8 feet long including the tail and
weighed 250 pounds. He located its tracks the
next morning and made a plaster cast of one
clear track that resembled the print of a smallish
puma, although claw marks were visible.
Present status: In 1987, the Victorian govern-
ment added pumas to the list of predators that
are known to attack livestock.
Possible explanations:
(1) Surviving Marsupial lion ( Thylacoleo
AUSTRALIAN BIG CAT 25
carnifex ), a leopard-sized, arboreal, carnivo-
rous marsupial that lived as recently as
10,000 years ago. However, both its front
and hind paws were fingerlike (with pseudo-
opposable thumbs bearing a huge claw) and
designed for climbing trees, and they would
not have left anything resembling cat tracks
behind. Its dentition was odd — it lacked ca-
nine teeth, compensating with huge incisors
and two pairs of bladelike carnassial teeth
that made it look more like a fierce badger
than a panther. Its shoulder height was in
the neighborhood of 2 feet— 2 feet 6 inches.
(2) Imported black Leopards ( Panthera par-
dus) that escaped from zoos or were brought
as U.S. regimental mascots during World
War II. Leopards are about 3 feet 6 inches-4
feet long, with a 2 feet 6 inch tail. They
stand about 2 feet at the shoulder. Melanism
in leopards is common in India and South-
east Asia. However, Australian big cat wit-
nesses have never reported spots, which are
visible in black specimens in bright daylight.
Leopards are also not known for widespread
slaughter of livestock — they generally kill
only what they need to survive. Nor can
they sustain a long-distance run. Also, black
and tawny cats were being hunted in Victo-
ria as long ago as the 1880s, long before
World War II.
(3) Descendants of one or more Pumas
{Puma concolor) supposedly brought as regi-
mental mascots by U.S. forces during World
War II or otherwise imported. The puma’s
coloration varies from sandy-brown to silver-
gray, with a whitish belly. Melanistic pumas
are virtually unknown. Its length is 3 feet 6
inches-4 feet 6 inches, with a 3 feet— 3 feet 6
inch tail, tipped with dark brown. The aver-
age height at the shoulder is 2 feet 6 inches.
Average weight is 80-200 pounds. Its eyes
shine greenish-gold. These animals are excel-
lent jumpers but cannot run long distances,
and they are shy and elusive by nature. Some
reports occurred in Australia prior to the
1940s.
(4) Dingos ( Canis familiaris var. dingo), feral
Australian dogs descended from early do-
mesticated dogs brought to the continent by
the Aborigines, are reddish-brown. They
hunt larger animals in packs, not singly, and
their kills are messy, with signs of a pro-
tracted struggle. Dingo tracks might be mis-
taken for cat tracks under poor conditions.
(5) A population of feral Domestic cats ( Felis
silvestris catus) that have grown large. Most
ferals (except those in the Gibson and Simp-
son Deserts, which are said to be up to 3
feet long) are no bigger than house cats,
however, and revert to a tabby pattern after
a few generations in the wild. Adult pumas
are seven times the weight of the heaviest
recorded Australian feral.
(6) An unknown species of marsupial carni-
vore, suggested by Rex Gilroy.
(7) A mainland population of TASMANIAN
DEVIL could account for some of the smaller
black animals, especially in Victoria.

Australian Camel
A native population of camel, a HOOFED MAM-
MAL, said to exist in Australia prior to 1840.
Variant name: Big one bullocky.
26 AUSTRALIAN CAMEL
Australian giant monitor seen in 1979 by herpetologist Frank Gordon in the Wattagan Mountains, New South
Wales. (William M. Rebsamen/Fortean Picture Library)
Distribution: Northern Territory, Australia.
Significant sighting: A solitary camel was occa-
sionally seen by Aborigines in the north, per-
haps as early as the 1830s. It was rumored to
have been brought by an early white settler.
Possible explanation: It is possible that a few
camels were brought to Australia prior to the
beginning of official and typically strict impor-
tation records. The first camel officially im-
ported came from the Canary Islands in 1840.
The next major importation of Dromedaries
( Camelus dromedarius) took place in 1860 for
the ill-fated Bourke and Wills Expedition to
Northern Australia. Between 1860 and 1907,
an estimated 10,000-12,000 camels were im-
ported into Australia for use as draft and riding
animals in the dry interior, especially in the
goldfields. By 1930, they had been replaced by
motor vehicles, and most had escaped or been
released into the wild. The establishment of
small, naturalized camel herds over the years
demonstrates that these animals could adapt
readily to the terrain and the climate. The cur-
rent population is variously estimated at
150,000-300,000, with approximately 50 per-
cent in Western Australia, 25 percent in the
Northern Territory, and 25 percent in western
Queensland and northern South Australia.

Australian Giant Monitor
Unknown LIZARD of Australia.
Variant names: Burrunjor (in Northern Terri-
tory), Mungoon-galli, Murra murri (in the Blue
Mountains), Whowie (in Riverina).
Physical description: Length, 20-30 feet or
more.
Behavior: Attacks cattle.
Distribution: Northern New South Wales;
Arnhem Land, Northern Territory; Cape York,
Queensland.
Significant sightings: In 1975, a group of
bushwalkers found large tracks and tail marks at
the edge of the Wallangambe Wilderness in the
Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
AUSTRALIAN GIANT MONITOR 27
On December 27, 1975, a farmer near Cess-
nock, New South Wales, saw a bulky, 30-foot
monitor lizard moving through scrub brush. It
was mottled gray in color, with dark stripes
along the back and tail, and stood 3 feet off the
ground.
In early 1979, herpetologist Frank Gordon
was driving his Land Rover in the Wattagan
Mountains in New South Wales south of Can-
berra when he saw a reptile 27-30 feet long by
the side of the road. It rose up and ran away on
all four legs into the neighboring woods.
In July 1979, cryptozoologist Rex Gilroy was
called to a freshly plowed field by a farmer.
Across the field were thirty or so tracks that
seemed to have been made by an enormous
lizard. While most of the tracks had been ruined
by rain, Gilroy was able to make a plaster cast of
one that had been preserved.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Perentie {Varanus giganteus), Aus-
tralia’s largest lizard, grows to 8 feet long;
some individuals might attain 10 feet. It is
cream-colored, with dark-brown speckles,
and it occurs from western Queensland to
the coast of Western Australia.
(2) Surviving Megalania prisca, a 15- to 21-
foot lizard that lived in central Australia in
the Pliocene and Pleistocene (2 mil-
lion-20,000 years ago). At 1,300 pounds, it
weighed ten times as much as the Komodo
dragon ( Varanus komodoensis) and was prob-
ably an active predator and scavenger. Its
teeth were nearly 1 inch long. At least some
specimens had a sagittal crest.

Badak Tanggiling
One-horned, rhinoceros-like HOOFED Mam-
mal of Southeast Asia.

Variant name: Scaled rhinoceros.
Physical description: Length, 10 feet; slightly
larger than the Sumatran rhino. Only one horn.
The female is sometimes hornless.
Distribution: Sumatra, Indonesia.
Significant sighting: The hunter J. C. Haze-
winkel shot eight of these animals in the 1920s.
Present status: The only currently known
species of rhino in Sumatra is the two-horned
Sumatran rhino {Dicerorhinus sumatrensis ) .
Possible explanation: The single-horned Javan
rhinoceros ( Rhinoceros sondaicus) may have per-
sisted in Sumatra until the 1940s.

Significant sightings: About 1890, a Banda-
Mbres tribesman named Moussa saw a Badigui
eating the large leaves of a tree (genus Mitra-
gyna) near a stream in the Bakala District of
Central African Republic. Its head was a bit
larger than a pythons, and its neck was much
longer than a giraffes. The skin was as smooth
as a snakes, with similar markings.
In 1928, a Badigui crushed a field of manioc
belonging to the chief of Yetomane, Central
African Republic, and left wide tracks. About
the same time, it killed a hippopotamus in the
River Brouchouchou.
Lucien Blanco us gun bearer Mitikata told
him that, in about 1930 near Ndele, Central
African Republic, he had seen an Ngakula-ngus
tracks, which were as wide as a truck.

times used for the Giant panda ( Ailuropoda
melanoleuca ) .
Variant names: Bei-sheng, Bitchun.
Physical description: Creamy-white bear,
smaller than the Polar bear ( Ursus maritimuf
Distribution: Shennongjia Forest, Hubei
Province, China; Mongolia.
Significant sighting: Four specimens, obtained
since 1963, have been on display in the Wuhan
and Beijing zoos.
Present status: Known from ancient Chinese
writings. Possibly confused with the giant panda
after it was discovered in 1868 or with the
Almas in Mongolia.
Possible explanations:
(1) Albino specimens or a pale-color morph
of the Brown bear ( Ursus arctof Shen-
nongjia is known for a high incidence of al-
binism in other species, including deer and
monkeys.
(2) Separate subspecies of the brown bear,
rather than a color variation.

the sound of chains. Can change its shape. Said
to appear at the deaths of notable people. Do-
mestic dogs will follow it, howling and baying.
Habitat: Dark lanes, churchyards.

Bar-Manu
WlLDMAN of Central Asia.
Etymology: Probably Gujari (Indo-Aryan),
“big, hairy one” or “strong, muscular man.”
Physical description: Muscular. Sometimes
squat and plump. Covered with dark-brown
hair except for eyes, nose, cheeks, knees, palms,
and soles. Huge head. Receding forehead. Pro-
truding eyebrows. Large, flat nose. Prominent
cheekbones. Wide mouth. Massive neck. Small
chin. Wide feet.
Behavior: Agile. Short, gutteral, or high-
pitched loud cries (“aha”) but no articulate
speech. Foul body odor. Omnivorous.
Tracks: Humanlike. Turned inward.
Habitat: Forested regions, especially at an al-
titude of 6,500-9,800 feet.
Distribution: Shishi Kuh Valley, near Chitral,
North-West Frontier Province, Pakistan.
Significant sightings: In September 1977,
goatherd Purdum Khan watched a Bar-manu
for two hours at an altitude of 7,600 feet in the
Hindu Kush Range in Pakistan’s North-West
Frontier Province. It was a young male, about 5
feet 8 inches tall, sitting and eating ant larvae.
Its penis was large and erect.
BAR-MANU 31
Tracks were found in 1994 by a French expe-
dition led by Jordi Magraner.
Possible explanation: Very few fossil hominid
remains have been found in the area, with the
exception of Selungur Cave, Kyrgyzstan, where
possible Homo erectus remains dating to
125,000 years ago were found, and Darra-I-Kur
Cave, Afghanistan, where archaic modern
human bones and artifacts were recovered.

Basajaun
WlLDMAN of Western Europe.
Etymology: Basque, “man of the woods”; from
baso (“forest”) + jaun (“man”).
Variant names: Anxo, Basandere (“woods
woman”), Bebrices, Iretges, Mono careto (“ugly
ape”), Nonell de la neu (Catalan, “Nonell of the
snows”), Peladits (“finger peeler”), Tartalo (cy-
clops), Torto, Yan del Gel.
Physical description: Height, 6-10 feet. Heav-
ily built. Long head-hair down to the knees.
Behavior: Agile. Protects flocks. Forecasts
storms. Wears animal skins. Generally benevo-
lent, though other Basque entities are not. Car-
ries a stick.
Distribution: Basque Country, Spain; the
Maladeta Massif, Aragon, Spain; the Pyrenees
Mountains of Spain and France.
Significant sightings: Two hairy men, brothers
named Iretges, lived long ago in the woods near
Bedeilhac-et-Aynat, Ariege Department, France,
wearing animal skins and abducting the occa-
sional shepherdess. One day, the villagers lured
them with a trap and killed them.
A 6-foot-tall apemanlike creature was seen in
the Pyrenees Mountains of Huesca Province,
Spain, in May 1979. Some workers saw it sitting
in a tree and making animal noises. It came
down and threw a tree trunk at them, where-
upon they fled.
A mountain climber named Juan Ramo Fer-
rer saw a reddish apelike creature near Bielsa,
Huesca Province, in the spring of 1994. It
jumped from tree to tree and squealed.

Basilisk
Birdlike lizard or venomous snake of Europe
and North Africa; see SEMIMYTHICAL BEASTS.
Etymology: From the Greek basiliskos (“little
king”).
Variant names: Cockatrice, from the Middle
French cocatris and the Latin calcatrix
(“tracker”); Regulus (Latin, “prince”).
Physical description: Length, 12 inches. An-
cient writers described a snakelike animal, with
a bright white spot on the head. By the late
Middle Ages, the animal had come to be called
a Cockatrice and was described as a bird with a
spotted rooster’s comb and a snakes tail.
Behavior: Moves with its middle portion
sticking up. Hisses. Said to be born from a
cocks egg hatched by a toad or snake. Its stare
can paralyze, and its breath (or odor) is fatal to
snakes and humans. Its skin was used to deter
spiders, snakes, and birds in Roman temples. It
can be frightened by a crowing rooster and

killed by a weasel. Seeing its own reflected image
can also prove fatal.
Distribution: Cyrenaica Province, Libya; Eu-
rope.
Significant sightings: A Basilisk killed many
people in Rome, Italy, in the mid-ninth century
until Pope Leo IV destroyed it with prayer.
Another Basilisk was discovered in a well in
Vienna, Austria, in June 1212.
In 1587, two children were killed by a
Basilisk in Warsaw, Poland, while they were
playing in an abandoned cellar. A servant who
found them was also struck dead. Authorities fi-
nally sent in a condemned prisoner, outfitted
with a leather suit and mirrors. The man
emerged with a snake that officials judged to be
a genuine Basilisk.
When the parish church of Renwick, Cum-
bria, England, was torn down in 1733, a huge,
bat-winged creature angrily flapped at the work-
men. One of them, John Tallantire, killed it
with a tree branch, earning him and his descen-
dants an exemption from fees to the manor.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Egyptian cobra ( Naja haje) is yel-
lowish-brown and becomes blue-black with
age. Found in North Africa and Arabia, it
can grow to 8 feet, though its more typical
length is 5-6 feet. It is not a spitting cobra,
but its venom can be deadly. This species
was probably the famous asp that bit
Cleopatra, and it is depicted on the crowns
of the Egyptian pharaohs. The cobras hood
might conceivably be compared to a rooster’s
crest when erect. African cobras do not have
hood markings.
(2) The King cobra ( Ophiophagus hannah) is
the largest of the venomous snakes. It is not
a spitting snake, and its venom is less toxic
than other cobras, but it injects much more
venom per bite — 6-7 milliliters, enough to
kill an elephant or twenty people. The king
cobra also has an unnerving ability to move
forward while in a threatening, strike pos-
ture. It has a black head with four white
crossbars. Body color varies from olive-green
to black. Though it can attain a length of 19
feet, it is not aggressive and is often adopted
as a village pet. It hunts other snakes in the
daytime and is the only snake known to
construct a nest. Its range is from India to
the Philippines. The use of Mongooses
(Family Herpestidae) in catching snakes in
India may explain the reference to weasels as
enemies of Basilisks.
(3) The Indian cobra ( Naja naja t) is a spitting
cobra. The venom is spit out in a shower and
directed toward the eyes of the victim, which
can cause blindness or death. This trait may
have given rise to the legend of the Basilisks
paralyzing stare. It can accurately hit a target
as much as 1 0 feet away in a lunging spit.
On its hood, it has two black-and-white
spots connected by a curved line.
(4) The Horned viper ( Cerastes cerastes) of
North Africa and Arabia has a pair of horns
over its eyes. The eleventh-century Arab
physician Avicenna was one of the first to
suggest this snake as a Basilisk candidate.
(5) David Heppell has suggested that
beached Giant squids ( Architeuthis sp.) may
have contributed to Basilisk lore.
(6) The lATZELWURM probably accounts for
some Basilisk characteristics.
(7) The crest is similar to the CROWING
CRESTED Cobra of East and Central Africa.
(8) The roosterlike Cockatrice might be de-

Bathysphaera Intacta
One of Beebe’s Abyssal Fishes of the North At-
lantic Ocean.
Physical description: Length, 6 feet. Has a row
of strong, pale-blue lights along its side. Two
ventrical tentacles, each tipped with a pair of red
and blue lights.
Distribution: North Atlantic Ocean.
Significant sighting: Observed only once at
2,100 feet by William Beebe in a bathysphere
off Bermuda on November 22, 1932.
Possible explanation: Beebe classified it with
the Scaleless black dragonfishes (Subfamily
Melanostomiidae), but he admitted this was a
guess and that the largest known dragonfish was
only 1 5 inches long.

BATS (Unknown)
Bats (Order Chiroptera) are the only group of
mammals to have evolved powered flight. Many
taxonomists now believe that bats evolved from a
common ancestor with the PRIMATES. They are
divided into two suborders, the Megabats
(Megachiroptera), which are fruit eaters such as
the giant Flying foxes (. Pteropus spp.), and the Mi-
crobats (Microchiroptera), which catch insects in
flight using a radarlike system of echolocation —
emitting high-frequency sound pulses and listen-
ing to the echo as those pulses bounce back from
solid objects. The earliest known fossil megabat is
Archaeopteropus transiens from the Early
Oligocene (30 million years ago) of Italy, while
the earliest known fossil microbat is Icaronycteris
index from the Early Eocene (52 million years
ago) of Europe and North America.
Contenders for the largest living bat are the
Great flying fox (. Pteropus neohibernicus) of New
Guinea and New Ireland, with a wingspan of 5
feet 6 inches-6 feet; the Large flying fox (7?
vampyrus) of Malaysia and Indonesia, with a
wingspan of 5 feet 6 inches; and the Indian fly-
ing fox (7? giganteus ), with a wingspan of 4-5
feet. All are megabats and quite timid.
Although vampires are not strictly a subject
for cryptozoology (since they are said to be either
shape-shifting supernatural beings or reanimated
dead members of our own species), their associ-
ation with bats adds an eerie, symbolic element
to the quest for Chiroptera that are unknown to
science. Though feared or revered as creatures of
the night in European folklore from ancient
times, bats were first explicitly connected to the
vampire mythos with Bram Stokers novel Drac-
ula in 1 897. Since then, they have made a sub-
stantial contribution to the concept of the vam-
pire as an exclusively nocturnal entity.
Only the microbats of the Subfamily Desmo-
dontinae are blood feeders, and these are con-
fined to tropical America. There are three
known species: The Common vampire bat ( Des -
modus rotundus ), the White-winged vampire bat
(. Diaemus youngi ), and the Hairy-legged vam-
pire bat ( Diphylla ecaudatd).
The largest carnivorous bat is the Australian
false vampire bat (. Macroderma gigas ), with a
wingspan of up to 32 inches. The largest carniv-
orous bat in Africa is the Yellow-winged bat
( Lavia frons ), with a wingspan of only 16 inches.
Winged cryptids are often difficult to classify
unless they are observed up close. From a dis-
tance, the surprised observer might find it diffi-
cult to distinguish between an unknown giant
bat, a Big Bird, a Flying Reptile, or even a
Flying Humanoid. A pterodactyl might look
very much like a large bat when swooping down
an African river at dusk. Consequently, only the
most mammalian of flying cryptids are included
in this section. Of the eight listed here, five are
giants and three are smaller, although they have
peculiar habits. Five are African, two are South
American, and one is Asian.

Batsquatch
Flying Humanoid of the northwestern United
States.
Etymology: S ASQUATCH with bat wings, coined
by the witness.
Physical description: Height, 9 feet. Bright-
blue fur. Yellowish eyes. Tufted ears. Long,
wolflike muzzle. Sharp, straight teeth. Batlike
wings. Clawed, birdlike feet.
Behavior: Apparently can affect car engines.
Distribution: Western Washington State.
Significant sighting: Brian Canfields truck
stalled as a winged creature dropped from the
sky into the road in front of him, near Lake
Kapowsin, Washington, on April 16, 1994. It
stood still for several minutes, unfolded its
wings, and started flapping them. Canfield
could feel the turbulence in the air as this oc-
curred. The creature slowly rose and flew off in
the direction of Mount Rainier.

SMALLHOMINID of Southeast Asia.
Etymology: Unknown.
Variant name: Ujit.
Physical description: Height, 4 feet.
Behavior: Nocturnal. Bipedal. Feeds on river
snails and breaks open their shells with a rock.
Said to kill people and rip out their livers. Wary
of fire.
Distribution: Sabah State, Malaysia, in the
north of the island of Borneo.
Tracks: Length, 6 inches. Width, 4 inches.
Toes and heel are humanlike, but sole is too
short and broad for a man. Big toe is on the op-
posite side of the arch of the foot.
Significant sighting: British zoologist John
MacKinnon found two dozen footprints in the
Ulu Segama National Park, Sabah, in 1969.
Possible explanation: Niah Cave in Sarawak,
northern Borneo, has yielded archaic human re-
mains. The cranium of a young, adult female
found in 1958 is known as “Deep Skull” and
may be 40,000 years old, which may represent
the earliest anatomically modern remains in In-
donesia.

BEARS (Unknown)
Modern Bears (Family Ursidae) are the largest
living members of the Order Carnivora. In gen-
eral, they have heavy bodies but can stand on
their hind legs and grab things with their front
paws. Their feet are plantigrade and hairless (ex-
cept for the polar bear), and they feature five
toes with nonretractile claws. Worldwide, there
are only eight species; along with the Giant
panda ( Ailuropoda melanoleuca) , they descended
from a common ancestor, the Dawn bear (Ur-
savus elemensis ), about 20 million years ago, in
the Early Miocene. The first true bears turned
up in both the Old and New World about 5
million years ago, in the Pliocene. The Giant
short-faced bear ( Arctodus simus) of the Pleis-
tocene must have been the most fearsome pred-
ator in North America, standing 1 1 feet tall on
its long hind legs and capable of short bursts of
speed in chasing its prey. The smaller Brown
bear ( Ursus arctos) replaced it at the end of the
Ice Ages.
Brown bears vary widely in coloration and
size. The Kodiak bear (U. a. middendorjfi ) ,
which lives on several islands in the Gulf of
Alaska, is the largest living terrestrial carnivore.
Adult males average 8 feet from nose to tail,
stand 4 feet 4 inches at the shoulder, and weigh
1,050-1,175 pounds. The greatest recorded
weight for a wild specimen was 1,656 pounds
for a male shot on Kodiak Island in 1894. The
Polar bear ( Ursus maritimus) is sometimes
longer but less robustly built.
Of the sixteen bearlike cryptids listed here,
three are North American, three are South
American, seven are Asian, and three are African.
Although the NANDI Bear is included, it is here
only because it has been incorrectly named and
is more likely to turn out to be a HYENA or Pei-
MATE; it also appears in those lists. The STI FF-
L EGGED Bear, which might reasonably be con-
sidered a Native American folk memory of the
giant short-faced bear, has also been colisted with
the ElEP HANTS because some think it represents
a legend of a living mammoth.

Etymology: After the Bardia Forest, where it is
found.
Physical description: Shoulder height, 11-13

feet. Massive version of the Asian elephant,
whose maximum height is said to be 11 feet.
Large forehead with two domes. Distinct nasal
bridge. Sloping back. Thick tail.
Tracks: 22.5 inches across.
Distribution: Karnali River, Royal Bardia Na-
tional Park, Nepal.
Significant sighting: From 1991 to 1997, John
Blashford-Snell led seven expeditions to the
Royal Bardia National Park in Nepal in search
of these outsize elephants. He succeeded in find-
ing and photographing two adult males, esti-
mated to be 11 feet 3 inches at the shoulder.
The larger one he nicknamed “Rajah Gaj” and
the smaller one “Kancha.”
Present status: The Bardia population is esti-
mated to consist of 100 elephants. A DNA
analysis of dung samples taken from Blashford-
Snells individuals has identified them as Asian
elephants.
Possible explanations:
(1) An isolated, inbred variety of the Asian
elephant (. Elephas maxima f
(2) A surviving fossil elephant, Elephas hysu-
dricus, known from fossils in the Siwalik
Hills of northern India and western Nepal,
that lived 2 million years ago.
(3) A surviving stegodon, a member of a
primitive, elephant-like family of animals
that died out more than 1 million years ago.
Stegodon ganesa was 1 1 feet 6 inches at the
shoulder but had a huge set of upper tusks
that curved sideways and nearly reached the
ground.

Beast of Bladenboro
Apparent variety of EASTERN PUMA of North
Carolina.
Physical description: Length, 3-4 feet, with a
14-inch tail. Shoulder height, 20 inches. Black.
Tracks: Catlike.
Distribution: Bladenboro, North Carolina.
Significant sighting: The Beast made its first
dog kill at Clarkton, near Bladenboro, North
Carolina, on December 29, 1953, and terror-
ized the countryside for about one week. It
killed nine dogs and one pet rabbit by crushing
the skulls and draining the blood. Nearly 1,000
people took part in a disorganized hunt on Jan-
uary 6-7 but failed to find anything.

Beast of Bodalog
Unknown SNAKE or other mystery animal of
Wales.
Etymology: After the Bodalog farm where the
beast was seen.
Behavior: Nocturnal. Aquatic. Kills sheep by
biting them just below the neck close to the
sternum.
Distribution: River near Rhayader, Powys,
Wales.
Significant sighting: By mid-October 1988, a
mystery animal had killed thirty-five sheep on
the Bodalog farm near Rhayader. It emerged
from a nearby river at night, attacked the sheep,
then returned to the river each time.
Present status: Only one series of reports.
Possible explanations:
(1) A feral Domestic dog ( Canis familiaris)
leaves a much messier carcass.
(2) A European otter ( Lutra lutra) will not
kill a sheep. Its primary food is fishes, sup-
plemented with crustaceans, birds, small
mammals, and frogs.
(3) American minks (. Mustela visori) have
been naturalized in parts of Britain. They are
known to kill rabbits, cats, and dogs, but
sheep would be too large to tackle.
BEAST OF BODALOG 37
(4) An unknown species of giant mink, per-
haps greater than 2 feet long, that would be
large enough to kill a sheep.
(5) Britain’s only venomous snake is the Eu-
ropean adder (yip era berus ), which only
feeds on small animals and stays away from
water.
(6) Neither of the nonvenomous snakes —
the Grass snake (Natrix natrix) or the Euro-
pean smooth-snake ( Coronella austriaca i ) —
are in the habit of attacking sheep.
(7) A large aquatic snake not native to
Wales, released by or escaped from a local
pet owner.

Beast of Bodmin Moor
British Big Cat of Cornwall.
Variant name : Beast of Bolventor.
Physical description: Leopard-sized. Black.
Behavior: Kills livestock.
Distribution: Bodmin Moor, Cornwall, En-
gland.
Significant sightings: A large, catlike creature
attacked Jane Fuller on October 26, 1993, when
she was walking her Labrador dog on Bodmin
Moor. She was temporarily stunned by a blow to
the head but escaped. Later, two sheep were
found dead in an adjoining field; one was de-
capitated, the other disemboweled.
An investigation from January 12 to July 1,
1995, by the British Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries, and Food failed to turn up any con-
clusive evidence of a resident large cat. The in-
quiry looked at seventy-seven reports of puma-
like or leopardlike cats and livestock killings
recorded in the Bodmin Moor area between Jan-
uary 1994 and June 1995. The investigators,
Simon Baker and Charles Wilson, determined
that videos taken of the Beast showed nothing
more than black domestic cats; a film showing
an alleged panther cub’s face close up was only a
cat’s, since its pupils contracted to a slit, not to
a circle like a leopard’s would have; the tracks
were only cat-sized, except for one that was at-
tributable to a dog; and the kills were probably
perpetrated by a medley of dogs, foxes, crows,
and badgers.
A skull found in the River Fowey near St.
Cleer, Cornwall, on July 24, 1995, turned out
to be from an imported leopard-skin rug.
Another investigation in December 1997 was
prompted by bite marks on livestock, drop-
pings, and new photos — one of which was taken
through binoculars near St. Austell, Cornwall,
and apparently shows a pregnant adult female
puma and a cub.

Beast of ’Busco
Giant Turtle of Indiana.
Etymology: Short for Churubusco, Indiana.
Variant names: Oscar, Phantom Churubusco
turtle.
Physical description: Turtle said to be as big as
a dining room table or a car top. Weight,
100-500 pounds.
Distribution: Fulks Lake, near Churubusco,
Indiana; Black Oak Swamp, near Hammond,
Indiana.
Significant sightings: Oscar Fulk saw a huge
turtle in Fulks Lake in 1898. It was seen again
in 1914 and then in July 1948 when Ora Blue
and Charley Wilson glimpsed it while fishing.
Gail Harris, on whose farm the turtle was spot-
ted, launched a major effort to catch the animal
in March 1949, employing scuba divers, deep-
sea gear, a female sea turtle, a sump pump, and
a dredging crane to drain the lake. The Fort
Wayne newspapers played up the story, and
thousands of people trampled across the farm
looking for the turtle. On October 13, about
200 people got their wish as the turtle leaped
from the water to try to catch a duck used as a
lure. But by December, the draining efforts were

failing, and Harris fell ill with appendicitis and
called the search off. A documentary film about
the event, called The Hunt for Oscar, was made
in 1994 by Terry Doran.
When a swamp was drained near Black Oak,
Indiana, in July 1950, a huge turtle with a head
as big as a humans was seen swimming around
a drain leading into the Little Calumet River.
Possible explanation: The Alligator snapping
turtle {Macro clemy s temminckii ) reportedly
grows to a maximum weight of 400 pounds. It
has a huge head with hooked upper and lower
beaks, prominent dorsal keels, and an extra row
of scutes at the side of the carapace. It lives al-
most exclusively in the Mississippi River
drainage areas of Mississippi, Louisiana,
Arkansas, and Missouri. It may occasionally mi-
grate further afield.

Beast of Exmoor
British Big Cat of southwestern England.
Physical description: Large, black cat or dog.
Length, 3 feet— 4 feet 6 inches. Shoulder height,
2 feet 6 inches. White markings on the head and
neck. Squat head. Short neck. Powerful, muscu-
lar body. Short legs.
Behavior: Nocturnal. Moves rapidly from
cover to cover. Kills sheep by breaking the neck
at the second vertebra or crushing the skull.
Tracks: Large, doglike prints, 4 inches across.
Smaller tracks may be a females.
Distribution: Exmoor, in the counties of Som-
erset and Devon, England.
Significant sightings: Attacks on livestock
gained prominence in Devon in the spring of
1983, though scattered reports of a black animal
in the area go back to 1982. Eric Lay, of Drew-
stone Farm near South Molton, thought he had
lost at least forty lambs over the previous few
months. Local police called in the Royal
Marines, which held stakeouts in early May and
June 1983 as part of Operation Beastie. They
were able to observe the animal through night-
vision equipment. Reports of both large cats and
dogs were logged. By late June, there were
eighty-six kills, but these dropped off in July.
Two boys, Wayne Adams and Marcus White,
saw the Beast on May 29, 1983, at Willingford
Farm on Exmoor. It was jet black with some
white markings and powerfully built. Though
its head looked like a German shepherd dogs,
the animal moved like a cat. The same night, a
sheep was killed at Ash Mill.
Trevor Beer saw a black cat measuring 4 feet
6 inches in the summer of 1984 at a cache of
deer carcasses on Exmoor that he had discovered
earlier in the year. It ran swiftly and had power-
ful forelegs.
In January 1987, Trevor Beer discovered
nine lynx like pawprints 3 inches in diameter at
Muddiford, Devon. In August, he took nine
photos from a distance of about 1 00 yards of a
black cat, 4 feet 6 inches in length, that stalked
and killed a rabbit on Exmoor.
In 1990, Lars Thomas led an expedition (Op-
eration Exmoor) to investigate sightings. At the
site of a sheep kill, he found a tuft of hair that
was identified as belonging to a puma.
Possible explanations:
(1) Trevor Beer proposed that feral Domestic
dogs ( Canis familiaris) were killing livestock,
but large cats of some kind were also in the
neighborhood. He noted that about 20 per-
cent of the sightings involved a fawn-colored
cat.
(2) Large, feral Domestic cats ( Felis silvestris
catus) were suggested at first by Nigel Brierly,
perhaps representing a hybrid strain that has
attained puma-sized proportions.
(3) A black Puma ( Puma concolor) was
Brierly s later conclusion, though melanism
is virtually unknown in this strictly Ameri-
can species.
(4) An unknown species of indigenous big
cat, suggested by Di Francis.
(5) A Eurasian lynx ( Lynx lynx) explanation
was favored by Frank Turk after lynx hairs
were identified at a sheep kill in 1986.
Lynxes became extinct in Britain during pre-
historic times. In May 2001, a specimen
later nicknamed “Lara” was captured in
Cricklewood, North London, following a re-
ported big-cat sighting. It was believed to be
BEAST OF EXMOOR 39
The Beast of Exmoor photographed in August 1987 by Trevor Beer. (Trevor Beer/Fortean Picture Library)
an escaped or abandoned pet. There are re-
ports of lynxes on the loose elsewhere on the
island, which has led to speculation about a
relict lynx population.

Beast of Gevaudan
An enigmatic DOG, wolf, or HYENA of south-
central France.
Etymology: Gevaudan was the old name for an
area that roughly corresponds to the modern de-
partment of Lozere, France.
Physical description: Bigger than a wolf. Red-
dish color. Large head. Small, pointed, upright
ears. Muzzle like a greyhound dogs. Wide, gray
chest. Black streaks on the back. Hind legs are
longer than forelegs. Cropped tail.
Behavior: Active in the daytime. Said to be
able to leap a distance of 28 feet and stand on its
hind legs on occasion. Cry is like a horse neigh-
ing. Seemingly impervious to bullets. Com-
pletely ignores sheep but is wary of cows’ horns.
Kills and eats women and children by knocking
them down and then biting into their throats
and faces, sometimes decapitating them.
Tracks: Doglike. Long and clawed.
Habitat: Montane forest.
Distribution: The mountainous region of
Languedoc, especially near Mont Mouchet,
Montagne de la Margeride, Lozere Department,
France.
40 BEAST OF GEVAUDAN
The BEAST OF Gevaudan, from an eighteenth-century print. (Fortean Picture Library)
Significant sightings: In June 1764, a young girl
was tending cows in the Foret de Mercoire near
Langogne, Lozere Department, when she saw
what looked like an enormous wolf running to-
ward her. Her dogs panicked, and the animal in-
jured her badly, but the cattle drove the Beast off
with their horns. The first fatality was a fourteen-
year-old shepherdess named Jeanne Boulet, who
was mauled on June 30. Eleven other fatal attacks
on women and children took place through the
end of November, when an army unit stationed in
Languedoc was called in to hunt down the Beast.
On December 24, 1764, a seven-year-old boy
was killed by a similar wolflike animal, as were a
shepherd and two young girls before the end of
the year. On January 12, 1765, the Beast at-
tacked a group of children near Vileret d’Apcher
and seized an eight-year-old boy, but the others
drove it away by jabbing it with a blade attached
to a stick and throwing stones.
After the army under Captain Duhamel,
aided by a host of volunteers, failed to catch the
animal even though they slaughtered about 100
wolves, King Louis XV in Lebruary called in a
famous Norman wolf hunter named Denneval,
who fared no better. The kings harquebusier
Antoine, Sieur de Beauterne, was sent to Ge-
vaudan in late July.
A girl of the village of Vachelerie, near Paul-
hac-en-Margeride, disappeared on the evening
of September 8, 1765. After a shepherd found
her cap, Beauterne and some gamekeepers
found torn and bloodstained clothing and fi-
nally the naked body of the girl, with fang
marks on her throat and one thigh eaten to the
bone.
By mid-September, seventy-three people had
been killed over a crescent-shaped area stretch-
ing about 31 miles long. Then, Beauterne killed
an animal on September 20, 1765, near the
BEAST OF GEVAUDAN 41
Royal Abbey of Chazes in Auvergne. It seems to
have been a large wolf (5 feet 7 inches long and
130 pounds) with a white throat. It was autop-
sied, taken to a taxidermist in Clermont-
Ferrand, then preserved at the Museum d’His-
toire Naturelle in Paris until it was lost. The
attacks ceased for nearly three months.
On December 2, 1765, two young children
were attacked near Mont Mouchet, and more
children were killed in February and March
1766. The region again appealed for royal aid,
but since the Beast was officially dead, the re-
quest was ignored.
When another little girl was killed at Noze-
rolles on June 18, 1767, the marquis d’Apcher
and twelve hunters set off to track the beast.
One of the hunters, Jean Chastel, shot a reddish
animal on June 19, after which the depredations
finally stopped. The corpse of the animal was
crudely stuffed, then displayed in the region for
two weeks, after which it was sent to Paris and
examined by the naturalist the comte de Buffon.
The animal was preserved at the Museum d’His-
toire Naturelle in Paris until 1819 and evidently
identified at the time as a striped hyena.
The official tally of deaths attributed to the
Beast of Gevaudan is 100, most of them women
and children.
Present status: A French film about the Beast,
Le pacte des loups, was released in 2001.
Possible explanations:
(1) A Gray wolf ( Canis lupus) that turned to
maneating, though this is completely un-
characteristic of the species and cannot ex-
plain the decapitations. Except for rare at-
tacks by rabid animals, there is virtually no
evidence for attacks by wolves on humans
throughout the twentieth century.
(2) Domestic dog ( Canis familiaris) x wolf
hybrid.
(3) The Striped hyena ( Hyaena hyaena) of
Africa, like the animal killed in 1767, has a
blunt muzzle, pointed nose, striped body,
and shaggy mane from head to tail. Primar-
ily interested in carrion, it can kill prey up to
the size of an adult donkey. It is seldom swift
enough to catch alert wild animals but is
said to occasionally snatch unprotected
human babies. Nonetheless, it is shier than
its relative the Spotted hyena ( Crocuta
crocuta ) .
(4) A baboon of some kind, since one was
rumored to have been killed in the area.
(5) A Wolverine ( Gulo gulo ), suggested by
Francis Petter.
(6) A sterile lion x tiger hybrid, either a
Liger (male lion x female tiger) or Tigon
(male tiger x female lion).
(7) Jean-Jacques Barloy has suggested that
Protestant hunters deliberately unleashed
huge dogs (or a hyena) on the Catholic peas-
antry after the first animal was killed in
1765. There was an intense Protestant-Jesuit
rivalry in the area at the time.
(8) A serial killer wearing an animal skin,
perhaps even one of the brothers of Jean
Chastel, who may have faked killing a hyena
to cover up the murders.

Beebe’s Abyssal Fishes
Deep-sea FISHES observed by William Beebe in a
bathysphere in the North Atlantic Ocean off
Nonsuch Island, Bermuda, between 1930 and
1934 and never seen since. These include an
Abyssal Rainbow Gar, Bathysphaera Intacta,
Five-Lined Constellation Fish, Palud Sail-
fin, and a Three- Starred Anglerfish. Beebes
bathysphere dives incorporated the first direct
observations of abyssal fishes in their natural en-
vironment.

Beebe’s Manta
Unknown species of FlSH in the South Pacific
Ocean.
Scientific name: Manta sp. nov., assigned by
Gunter Sehm in 1996.
Physical description: Diamond-shaped body
configuration. Dark-brown back, faintly mot-
tled. Two broad, brilliantly white, distinctly V-
shaped bands extend halfway down the back
from each side of the head. Wingspan, 10 feet,
approximately 1.5 times the body length. Wing
tips are white, at least on the underside. Con-
spicuous horns. Short tail.
Distribution: Galapagos Islands; New Caledo-
nia; Tabuaeran Atoll, Kiribati; off Baja Califor-
nia, Mexico; Great Barrier Reef, Queensland,
Australia.
Significant sightings: Naturalist William Beebe
observed a white-banded manta ray off Isla
Genovesa in the Galapagos Islands on April 27,
1923. The fish collided with his vessel, Noma,
then sped away on the surface.
Beebe’s MANTA, a striped ray of the Pacific Ocean.
(William M. Rebsamen)
A documentary for German television, called
Sharks: Hunters of the Seas and broadcast on De-
cember 28, 1989, featured a thirty-second clip
of a manta with white, symmetrical, V-shaped
bands.
A British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)
television program titled Holiday Guide to Aus-
tralia, broadcast on November 7, 1999, in-
cluded an aerial view of a swimming manta ray
with a pair of white, longitudinal bands on its
wings, filmed over the Great Barrier Reef.
Possible explanation: The pigmentation of the
uniformly dark Giant manta ( Manta birostris) is
easily rubbed off, but this only results in blotch-
ing. Sometimes, the animal is seen with white
shoulder patches but not distinct banding. It has
a wingspan up to 26 feet and is found in cir-
cumtropical waters.

Behemoth
Amphibious animal of the Bible; see S EM MYTH-
ICAL BEASTS.
Etymology: Plural form of the Hebrew be-
hemah (“beast”), inclusive of all wild and do-
mesticated animals.
Physical description: Robust body. Nose
BEHEMOTH 43
“pierces through snares.” Long, strong tail “like
a cedar.”
Behavior: Herbivorous. Hearty drinker (“can
draw up Jordan into his mouth”).
Habitat: Forested rivers or swamps.
Possible explanations:
(1) A surviving sauropod dinosaur similar to
the MOKELE-MBEMBE of Central Africa, sug-
gested by Roy Mackal.
(2) The Hippopotamus ( Hippopotamus am-
phibius) was first advocated by Samuel
Bochart in 1663. Its small tail is a problem,
but it is amphibious, robust, and herbivorous.
(3) The Nile crocodile ( Crocodylus niloticus)
has a strong tail, but it is a carnivore.
(4) The African elephant ( Loxodonta
africand) has been suggested by Georg Kas-
par Kirchmayer and Sylvia K. Sikes.

Beithir
Large water SNAKE of Scotland.
Etymology: Gaelic and Irish, “serpent,”
“beast,” or “bear,” often with a supernatural
connotation.
Physical description: Length, 9-10 feet.
Behavior: Active in summer.
Habitat: Lakes, caves.
Distribution: Around Loch a Mhuillidh,
Highland, Scotland.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Grass snake ( Natrix natrix) is a
greenish-olive snake with a yellowish collar
around the neck. It occasionally grows up to
6 feet 6 inches long in Southern Europe, but
in England and Wales, it generally attains a
length of only 5 feet 9 inches. It likely in-
habited the lowlands of Scotland at one
time. It favors areas near lakes or streams.
(2) The European eel ( Anguilla anguilla )
rarely grows longer than 4 feet. The fishes
spawn in the Atlantic Ocean, and the larvae
transform into elvers on their migration
route to freshwater streams and rivers in
Europe, where they live for many years.

Bennu Bird
The sacred Bird of Egypt that escorted souls to
heaven. Found in texts of the Fifth Dynasty of
the Old Kingdom (2498-2345 B.C.). It was a
symbol of Osiris and resurrection and thus a
possible source for the Greek PHOENIX.
Etymology: The ancient Egyptian bn.w or
benu, for both “purple heron” and “date palm.”
Physical description: Giant, heronlike bird.
Taller than a man. White plumage. Twin red
and gold plumes (or tufts) on head. Pointed bill.
Slender, curved neck. Long tail feathers. Long
legs.
Behavior: Gregarious.
Distribution: Egypt; Arabia.
Significant sightings: A large stork or heron is
shown on a painted bas-relief on the inner wall
of a tomb of an officer in the household of
Pharaoh Khufu (2589-2566 B.C.), the builder
of the Great Pyramid.
Enormous, conical bird nests, about 15 feet
tall, were discovered along the coast of the Gulf
of Suez, Egypt, by James Burton around 1822.
The local Arabs told him they were built by a
large, storklike bird that lived in the area until
recently.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Gray heron ( Ardea cinerea) is 3 feet
2 inches long and gray, with a black shoul-
der patch and black crest. It often stands
44 BEITHIR
The BENNU BIRD. Detail from the Papyrus ofAnhai (British Museum no. 10,472). (Fortean Picture Library)
with its neck in an S curve and is a common
sight in lakes, rivers, and marshes of North
Africa and the Arabian coast.
(2) The Goliath heron ( Ardea goliath) is the
largest living heron, nearly 5 feet long. It is
blue-gray above, with a brown shoulder patch
and a marbled pattern on its neck but no
crest. It favors large lakes and swamps where
it can wade deeper than other birds. The neck
is folded when resting, but it can suddenly
straighten, shooting the head forward. The
bird is found on both sides of the Red Sea.
(3) The Purple heron ( Ardea purpurea) is
about 3 feet long, with a snakelike neck held
in a distinctive kink. It is purplish-brown
with a long, black crest and is found
throughout Africa and the Middle East.
(4) A surviving Giant heron ( Ardea ben -
nuides ), an extinct bird that was larger than
the goliath heron. Fossil bones have been
found on the island of Umm A1 Nar near
Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.
Radiocarbon dating indicates the birds lived
in the third millennium B.C., which encom-
passes the Egyptian First to the Eleventh
Dynasties. Ella Hoch gave the bird its scien-
tific name based on the possibility that it
had inspired the Bennu bird symbol.

Bergman’s Bear
Distinct variety or subspecies of brown B EAR of
East Asia.
Physical description: Black. Short fur. Exceed-
ingly large. Weight, 1,100-2,500 pounds. Large
skull.
Tracks: Size, 14.5 inches by 10 inches.
Distribution: Southern Kamchatka Peninsula,
Siberia.
Present status: This giant variety is likely ex-
tinct. The last known specimen, a pelt from
Ust’-Kamchatsk, was examined by Swedish zo-
ologist Sten Bergman in 1920.
Possible explanation: Brown bears ( Ursus arctos)
vary considerably in appearance; this may just
have been a regional variant of the Siberian brown
bear ( U. a. beringianus) rather than a subspecies.

Beruang Rambai
Unknown PRIMATE of Southeast Asia.
Etymology: Land Dayak (Austronesian),
“long-haired bear,” the common name for the
sun bear.
Variant name: Bali djakai (Lawangan/Aus-
tronesian, “demon”).
Physical description: Robust body. Shoulder
height, 4 feet. FTeight standing erect, 6 feet.
Covered in black hair. Bullet-shaped head. Bull
neck. Flair on arms and thighs is 3 inches long.
Thick legs.
Behavior: Walks on all fours. Stands on its
hind legs occasionally. Beats its chest.
Tracks: Both humanlike and bearlike.
Distribution: Central Kalimantan, Indonesia,
as well as in neighboring Sarawak State,
Malaysia, both on the island of Borneo.
Significant sightings: In the 1930s, Leonard
Clark ran across a Bali djakai at a water hole in
the Borneo mountains. It picked up a helmet
left behind, detected the scent of Clark and his
guide, beat its chest, and disappeared into the
bush.
Gathorne Gathorne-Hardy, earl of Cran-
brook, collected descriptions of the Beruang
rambai in the 1960s and concluded it was nei-
ther bear nor orangutan.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Sun bear ( Helarctos malayanus) is a
logical candidate, based on the name alone,
though its hair is short.
(2) Misidentified Orangutan ( Pongo pyg-
maeus).

Big Bird
Large Bird of North America, similar to the leg-
endary Thunderbird.
Etymology: Descriptive, though partially in-
spired by the character “Big Bird” on the U.S.
television series Sesame Street (1969- ).
Variant names: Giant Owl, Giasticutus (in
the Ozark Mountains), MOTHMAN, PlASA,
Tacuache (Spanish, “opossum”), THUNDERBIRD,
Thunderbird (Pennsylvania).
Physical description: Length, 3-8 feet standing
upright. Black, gray, or brown plumage. FTead
and short neck, either feathered and eaglelike or
bald and vulturelike. Long, curved beak.
Wingspan, 8-30 feet. Narrow wings. White
wing tips. Short legs.
Behavior: Soars with wings level, using slug-
gish or graceful wing beats. Possibly migrates
from the Pacific Northwest to the southern
United States in the winter; its northward re-
turn in spring coincides with the rainy season.
In the Midwest, it may migrate to the Ozark
Mountains in July and fly north to Wisconsin
in April. Call is “whoo whoo whoo.” Feeds on

Significant sightings: Eagles have occasionally
been reported to carry off children in their
BIG BIRD 47
talons, though even the largest can only lift a
few pounds. The most often cited cases were in
Valais, Switzerland, in 1838 when five -year-old
Marie Delex was carried off and eaten by a
Golden eagle ( Aquila chrysaetos)\ and in the fall
of 1868 in Tippah County, Mississippi, when
eight-year-old Jemmie Kenney was grabbed and
dropped from a height sufficient to kill him.
Another incident may have occurred in January
1895 near Bergoo, West Virginia, when ten-
year-old Landy Junkins disappeared in the
woods and locals began reporting a huge eagle
that was nesting on nearby Snaggle Tooth
Knob.
Numerous reports of a bird the size of a Piper
Cub airplane came from St. Louis, Missouri,
and adjoining areas of Illinois in April 1948. On
April 26, St. Louis chiropractor Kristine Dolezal
saw it nearly collide with a plane, but the animal
flapped its grayish-black wings and flew off into
the clouds. She could discern ridges across the
wings when they were outspread.
On February 27, 1954, Gladie M. Bills and
her daughter saw what she at first thought were
six jets moving in circles, diving, and playing
around at a high altitude near Hillsboro, Ore-
gon. She looked at them through a telescope
and saw they were birds with glossy white wings.
David St. Albans saw a large, black bird flying
over a cornfield in Keeneyville, Illinois, in July
1968. It had a tuft of white feathers at the base
of its neck, but the head and neck were bare.
On January 1, 1976, a black bird more than
5 feet long, with dark-red eyes and a thick, 6-
inch beak, was seen standing in a plowed field
100 yards away by two children near Harlin-
gen, Texas. Sightings continued in the Rio
Grande Valley for two months. On January 7,
Alverico Guajardo went out to see what had
collided with his trailer home near Brownsville
and saw a 4-foot-tall, winged creature with a
long beak and covered in black feathers; it
shrieked as Guajardo ran next door. On Febru-
ary 24, three schoolteachers driving to work
near San Antonio saw a bird with a 15- to 20-
foot wingspan gliding above their cars. They
said it looked like a pteranodon, an extinct fly-
ing reptile. Further reports took place in De-
cember 1976.
On July 25, 1977, in Lawndale, Illinois, ten-
year-old Marlon Lowe was picked up by his
shirt by one of two large birds that came soaring
in from the south. He screamed and punched at
the bird until it dropped him after carrying him
30-40 feet. His parents and two other friends
ran outside and saw the birds as they flew away.
Marlon later picked out photos of California
condors as the bird that attacked him. Over the
next two weeks, there were at least eight other
reports of similar birds in central Illinois.
Paramedic James Thompson saw a ptero-
dactyl-like bird, with a 5- to 6-foot wingspan,
gliding through the air early in the morning of
September 14, 1982, east of Los Fresnos, Texas.
It had a hump on its back and a pouch on its
neck.
Reynaldo Ortega saw a giant bird standing on
the roof of his house in Naranjito, Puerto Rico,
on April 23, 1995. It was black and eaglelike,
3-4 feet tall, with a thick neck and piercing
eyes. He thought it had a wolflike muzzle in-
stead of a beak.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Turkey vulture ( Cathartes aura),
though all New World vultures and condors
are incapable of gripping prey with their
feet. This bird is widespread in the south-
eastern United States all year and is common
through most of the rest of the country in
the summer. Its wingspan is nearly 6 feet.
Length, more than 2 feet. It has a distinc-
tive, bare red head.
(2) The Black vulture ( Coragyps atratus) is
widespread in the southeastern United States
and has been slowly expanding its range to
the northeast. Its wingspan is nearly 5 feet.
Length, 2 feet. The bare head is gray.
(3) The King vulture ( Sarcoramphus papa) is
a rain forest carrion feeder found from
southern Mexico to Argentina. It has a
brightly colored bald head, broad wings, and
a short tail. It is also thought to prey on
small reptiles and young mammals, though
it lacks the strength to carry them. Length, 2
feet 6 inches.
(4) The Andean condor (Vultur gryphus), the
world s largest bird of prey, is over 4 feet
long with a wingspan up to 10 feet 6 inches,
48 BIG BIRD
though the average is 9 feet 3 inches for
males. It weighs 23-25 pounds. The color is
shiny black with white patches on the wings,
a white ring on the neck, and a bare, gray-
red head. It soars effortlessly without flap-
ping its wings. Carrion is its normal diet,
supplemented with seabird eggs. It will occa-
sionally attack calves, fawns, or beached
whales. It is often seen along the South
American Pacific coast but returns to the
Andes Mountains to roost. In 1992, some
female Andean condors were introduced in
Los Padres National Forest, California, as a
test release for California condors, but they
were all recaptured later.
(5) The California condor ( Gymnogyps call -
fornianus) is the largest U.S. vulture, reach-
ing a length of 4 feet, a wingspan of 9 feet 4
inches, and a weight of 20-25 pounds. Un-
substantiated wingspans up to 11 feet 3
inches have been claimed. The bird is black
with white wing linings and has a naked,
red-orange head that changes color with its
mood. In 1987, the few remaining wild
birds were caught for a captive breeding pro-
gram; reintroduction began in 1992 in re-
mote sites of Los Padres National Forest,
California. Pleistocene fossil remains of this
bird have been found in New York and
Florida, as well as Arizona and New Mexico.
There is evidence that these condors re-
turned to the Southwest sporadically as early
as the 1700s in response to the introduction
of large herds of cattle, horses, and sheep
that replaced the extinct Pleistocene
megafauna as a source of carrion.
(6) The Golden eagle (. Aquila chrysaetos) is
the largest eagle in the United States and Eu-
rope, with a wingspan of 7 feet. Though it
winters in eastern states, it is fairly scarce. It
soars with wings upcurved and takes prey
(small mammals) opportunistically with out-
stretched talons. It has a golden-bronze
nape. There is some evidence in New Mex-
ico and Oregon that it has attacked calves
weighing over 200 pounds. The white head
of the Bald eagle ( Haliaeetus leucocephalus )
makes it almost too recognizable to be
misidentified. Both eagles grow larger in
northern latitudes and higher altitudes.
(7) The Fiarpy eagle ( Harpia harpyja ) is the
dominant bird of prey in Central and South
America. Its massive feet can pick up mon-
keys, sloths, opossums, and snakes. It has a
crest of dark feathers on its head and a
wingspan of nearly 1 0 feet. Length, more
than 3 feet. The Monkey-eating eagle ( Pithe -
cophaga jejferyi) of the Philippines is smaller.
The rare Solitary eagle ( Harpy haliaetus soli-
taries) of Mexico is 2 feet 6 inches long but
has never been reported north of Sonora.
(8) The Crowned hawk-eagle ( Stephanoaetus
coronatus) of Africa preys on small antelopes.
It has a wingspan up to 6 feet 9 inches. There
is some evidence from Zimbabwe and Zam-
bia that it will occasionally attack a child.
(9) Steller’s sea eagle ( Haliaeetus pelagicus)
averages an 8-foot wingspan and nests on
the Asiatic side of the Bering Sea. It has a
huge, orange-yellow bill and white shoulders
and makes occasional visits to Alaska. The
White-tailed eagle ( Haliaeetus albicilla) is
smaller, less distinctive, and an even rarer
visitant to the Aleutians.
(10) The Common black-hawk ( Buteogallus
anthracinus) has a wingspan greater than 4
feet and is found in cottonwood groves in
Arizona.
(11) The Crested caracara ( Caracara cheri-
way ), a black-crested, white-necked falcon,
is fairly common in southern Texas and
southern Arizona. Its wingspan is more than
4 feet.
(12) The Griffon vulture ( Gyps fulvus) is a
large, brown- winged carrion feeder with a
wingspan of 9 feet and a length of nearly 4
feet. It breeds in Spain, several locations in
North Africa, the Balkans, Greece, Turkey,
the Caucasus, Israel, and eastward to Central
Asia.
(13) The White-backed vulture ( Gyps
africanus ), with a wingspan of 7 feet 10
inches, is Africa’s commonest large vulture.
A juvenile specimen was apparently responsi-
ble for a Big bird report in Ohio in 1972.
(14) The Great blue heron (Ardea herodias) is
common in North American wetlands and
reaches a length of nearly 4 feet.
BIG BIRD 49
(15) The Southern ground hornbill ( Bu -
corvus cafer ), the largest hornbill, is native to
Central and South Africa. It attains a length
of 3 feet 6 inches.
(16) The Marabou stork ( Leptoptilos cru-
meniferus) grows to nearly 5 feet in length
and is identifiable by its huge throat wattle
and massive, wedge-shaped bill. Its range is
limited to sub-Saharan Africa.
(17) The Sandhill crane (Grus canadensis) is
about the size of a great blue heron but is
gray, mottled with rust stains. It has a
wingspan up to 6 feet 5 inches.
(18) The Whooping crane {Grus americana)
is a rare and unusual sight, as it is limited to
about 100 birds wintering in coastal Texas.
Its length is 4 feet 4 inches, with a wingspan
of 7 feet 3 inches. Males are white, with
black primary feathers. Its migration path is
from northern Alberta to south Texas.
(19) The Black- footed albatross ( Phoebastria
nigripes) is rarely seen over land although a
fair number of these birds are seen over the
Pacific Ocean in the spring and summer.
Mostly dark gray, with a wingspan of over
7 feet.
(20) The Wandering albatross ( Diomedea
exulans) has a wingspan around 9 feet 9
inches, but this is primarily an Antarctic
bird, with Peru as its farthest extension
north. It rarely travels any distance inland.
(21) The Wood stork ( Mycteria americana) is
found in Florida and the Gulf Coast. White
with a dark head and neck, it reaches a
length of 3 feet 4 inches and has a wingspan
over 5 feet.
(22) The Jabiru (Jabiru mycteria) is a tropi-
cal, white, black-headed stork with a roseate
neck that is only occasionally seen in Texas.
Its length is 4 feet 4 inches.
(23) The American white pelican ( Pelecanus
erythrorhynchos) has a wingspan up to 9 feet.
Its black flight feathers are distinctive when
it is soaring.
(24) A surviving Teratorn (Teratornithinae),
a member of a subfamily of predatory vul-
tures that resembled reptiles in some ways.
Their jaws were designed to swallow living
prey, though their talons were not designed
for seizing. They probably used their sharp,
hooked beaks to catch animals. The largest
known flying bird, Argentavis magnificens ,
weighed 158 pounds, stood 5-6 feet tall,
and had a wingspan of 23-25 feet. It lived
in Argentina in the Late Miocene, 8—5 mil-
lion years ago. In North America, Teratornis
merriami weighed about 36 pounds and had
an 11 foot 6 inch-12 foot 6 inch wingspan,
while T. incredibilis of Nevada and Califor-
nia lived in the Pleistocene and had a
wingspan of 17-19 feet.
(25) A surviving pterosaur, a fossil FLYING
REPTILE that supposedly died out at the end
of the Cretaceous period, 65 million years
ago.
(26) A surviving La Brea condor ( Breagyps
clarki ), a slightly smaller bird than the Cali-
fornia condor with a long, slender beak,
known from Pleistocene fossils in Nevada
and southern California.
(27) An unknown species of giant bat, sug-
gested by Mark A. Hall for the Rio Grande
Valley sightings of 1976.

Big Grey Man
Paranormal ENTITY of Scotland, similar to a
True Giant hominid.
Variant names: Fear liath mor, Ferla mor, Fer-
las mhor, Ferlie more, Fomor (all Gaelic).
Physical description: Height, 10-20 feet. Gray
or olive colored, or covered with short brown
hair. Pointed ears. Broad shoulders. Long, wav-
ing arms.
Behavior: Often appears during a fog or mist.
Stands erect. Makes odd crunching noises or a
high-pitched humming sound. Occasionally ac-
companied by ghostly music or voices. Follows
hikers. Creates an icy feeling in the air — a cold,
physical presence that induces fear, panic, de-
pression, or apathy.
Tracks: Rare and unreliable.
Distribution: The summit of Ben Macdhui in
the Cairngorm Mountains, Grampian, Scotland.
Significant sightings: In 1891, Norman Collie
was returning from the summit when he heard
the crunch of footsteps behind him. For every
step he took, he heard another crunch, as if
someone had a stride three or four times the size
of his own. He ran downhill the last few miles.
In 1942, Sydney Scroggie was camping out at
the Shelter Stone by the Garbh Uisge on Ben
Macdhui when he saw a tall, stately figure tak-
ing deliberate steps across the burns flowing into
Loch Avon.
On December 2, 1952, James Alan Rennie
photographed a series of tracks in the snow in a
straight line on the mountain. Each print was
about 19 inches long and 14 inches wide, with
a stride of 7 feet. At one point, the tracks
jumped a road over a distance of 30 feet.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Brocken spectre is the giant shadow
of an observer cast on a wall of white mist
and often surrounded by one or more con-
centric rings of color (the “glory”) centered
on the figure’s head. However, this optical
effect does not seem to be what hikers have
been reporting.
(2) The high altitude, isolation, and meteoro-
logical conditions on Ben Macdhui may pro-
duce hallucinations. The warm Fohn wind of
southern Germany is said to produce
headaches, nausea, aching joints, fatigue, irri-
tability, apathy, and depression. A similar ef-
fect might take place in the Cairngorms, caus-
ing confusion, stress, and disorientation.

Big Wally
FRESHmTER MONSTERof Oregon.
Etymology: After the lake.
Physical description: Varied. Native American
legends describe a manatee-like animal. A
doubtful 1885 tale by a prospector involves a
100-foot-long monster with a hippos head.
Other sightings seem to be of a large sturgeon or
an animal like OGOPOGO.
Distribution: Wallowa Lake, Oregon.
Significant sighting: On June 30, 1982, Mar-
jorie Cranmer and Kirk Marks observed a 50-
foot creature creating waves along the northeast-
ern shore. It had seven dark-colored humps.
Possible explanation: White sturgeon (Aci-
penser transmontanus) are not known in this
lake, but they grow to 20 feet in length.

Bigfoot
GlANT Hominid of western North America. By
extension, the term is also applied to similar Ho-
MINIDS observed elsewhere.
Etymology: Named in 1958 when a series of
huge tracks was found near Bluff Creek in
northern California. Coined by newspaper
columnist Andrew Genzoli, in the Humboldt
(Calif.) Times, October 5, 1958. Plural is usually
Bigfoot, sometimes Bigfeet.
Scientific names: Paranthropus eldurrelli, pro-
posed by Gordon R. Strasenburgh Jr. in 1971;
Gigantopithecus canadensis, Australopithecus
canadensis, or Gigantanthropus canadensis, all
proposed by Grover Krantz in 1985.
Variant names: Jacko, Mat AH Kagmi,
Mountain devil, PATTY, Sasquatch, Tuni-ka
(Tanana/Na-Dene). See also CANNIBAL GlANT.
Physical description: Bulky, robust body.
Height, 6-9 feet, with an average of 7 feet 1 0
inches. Average weight estimated at 660
pounds. Shaggy body hair, ranging from dark
brown or black to light brown and gray. Color
variation does not seem related to height or age.
Small, pointed head. Sloping forehead. Flat face.
Heavy browridge with upcurled fringe of hair.
Facial hair except around nose, mouth, and ears.
Deep-set eyes. Broad and fiat nose. Wide
mouth. Short, thick neck. Huge shoulders and
chest. Females have large, hairy breasts. Arms
are thick and long in proportion to height.
Behavior: Primarily nocturnal. Walks upright
with a long stride and long arm swing, leaning
forward slightly with its knees bent. Not afraid
of walking in water, perhaps even using water-
ways as travel paths. Top running speed may be
as much as 35-40 miles per hour. Inactive in
cold weather. Solitary, though family groups
have occasionally been reported. Calls are high-
pitched whistles, screams, and howls, including:
“eeek-eeek-eeek,” “sooka-sooka-sooka,” “gob-
BlGFOOT sculpture carved from a redwood stump in the
1960s by Jim McClarin in front of the Willow Creek

uh-gob-uh,” “ugh-ugh-ugh,” and “uhu-uhu-
uhu.” A strong, putrid odor often reported.
Omnivorous (rodents, deer, roots, larvae, car-
rion, berries, grasses, clams, fishes, and vegeta-
bles). Searches for rodents by digging up rocks
and piling them up. Splits rotted logs in search
of grubs. May also pursue and kill deer. Kid-
nappings of humans, usually females, have been
reported. Sometimes throws rocks at people.
Shows curiosity about human activity. No ap-
parent use of fire or tools. The population in the
Pacific Northwest has been estimated as
1,500-2,000 adult individuals.
Tracks: Five-toed human print 4-27 inches
long, with an average length of 14-18 inches.
The width ranges from 3 to 13.5 inches at the
ball of the foot, with an average of 7.2 inches.
Heels are 1.5-9 inches wide, with an average of
4.8 inches. Toes are slightly curled and in a
straight line like peas in a pod. Big toe is not ap-
preciably larger than or separated from the oth-
ers. A substantial ridge of soil or sand separates
52 BIGFOOT
the toes from the ball of the foot. The foot is
narrow in the middle (sometimes described as
an “hourglass” shape), and the impression of the
heel is deeper in the inner rather than the outer
side. Flat arches. Transverse, midsole dermal
ridges (dermatoglyphics) and sweat pores often
present. Stride measures 4-6 feet. Tracks point
straight ahead, with feet turning neither inward
nor outward. Tracks are found in remote areas,
and the movements indicated by the tracks (me-
andering, zigzagging) are typical for a wild ani-
mal. The morphology of the tracks, including
small details, is uniform enough over a wide ge-
ographic area to suggest authenticity. Feces and
hair samples have also been recovered.
Habitat: Montane forests.
Distribution: From northern California, Ore-
gon, Washington, and Idaho north through
British Columbia and southwestern Alberta to
Alaska.
Significant sightings : In the fall of 1869, a
hunter saw a male and female Bigfoot near
Orestimba Creek in Stanislas County, Califor-
nia. The male was covered with dark-brown and
cinnamon hair, stood 5 feet tall, made whistling
noises, and disrupted the hunters campfire.
When the steamer Capilano put into an In-
dian village at Bishop’s Cove, British Columbia,
in March 1907, the crew was assailed by terror-
ized villagers who wanted to escape from a 5-
foot-tall monkey covered with long hair that
came on the beach at night to dig clams and
howl.
A group of miners claimed to have taken a
shot at a huge, apelike creature near a mine in a
canyon on the east side of Mount St. Fielens,
Washington, in July 1924. Later, one of them,
named Fred Beck, shot another ape in the back
three times, causing it to fall off a cliff. At night,
a group of the apes assaulted the miners in their
cabin for five hours, pounding on the walls and
hurling rocks. The cabin had no windows, so
the miners couldn’t see what was attacking
them. The next day, they packed up and re-
turned to Kelso and told their story. Large tracks
were found in the canyon, which was thereafter
named Ape Canyon.
Prospector Albert Ostman claimed he was
kidnapped in the summer of 1924 near Toba
Inlet, British Columbia, and lived six days with
a Bigfoot family consisting of an older male and
female and two younger ones, also male and fe-
male. The adult male was between 7 and 8 feet
tall and had carried Ostman in his sleeping bag
for three hours to a remote valley. Ostman tried
to escape, but the old male blocked his way.
While he was there, Ostman made many obser-
vations about their lifestyle and habits. Fie fi-
nally tricked the adult male into swallowing the
contents of his snuff tin, and in the ensuing
confusion, he made his escape back to the coast.
In October 1941, Jeannie Chapman and her
three young children fled from a Bigfoot that
came toward their isolated cabin near Ruby
Creek, British Columbia. Later, 16-inch, hu-
manlike footprints were found circling the
house. The creature had apparently entered a
woodshed and opened up a 55-gallon barrel of
salt fish.
William Roe was climbing Mica Mountain
southwest of Tete Jaune Cache, British Colum-
bia, in October 1955 when he saw what he at
first thought was a grizzly bear about 75 yards
away. Soon, he realized it was a huge female, 6
feet tall and 3 feet wide, completely covered
with dark-brown, silver-tipped hair. Its arms
reached almost to its knees, and it had breasts. It
squatted down to eat the leaves from some
bushes, but when it saw him, it stood up and
walked away cautiously. Roe leveled his rifle to
shoot it but thought it was too human-looking
to kill.
Gerald Crew and others found large numbers
of giant tracks around their road construction
camp in high country near Willow Creek, Cali-
fornia, several times between August 1958 and
February 1959. The tracks descended an incline
of 75°, and the average stride was more than 4
feet. Occasionally, the track maker would dis-
turb heavy fuel drums and steel culverts, and
once it moved a 700-pound wheel belonging to
earth-moving equipment. Recently, some doubt
has been cast on these events; it’s been alleged
that the footprints were hoaxed by the construc-
tion crew contractor and foreman, Ray and
Wilbur Wallace. Fiowever, the Wallaces had dif-
ficulty keeping contract workers because the
tracks terrified the crew.
BIGFOOT 53
On October 20, 1967, Roger Patterson and
Bob Gimlin took 952 frames of 16-millimeter
film showing a female Bigfoot walking away from
them near Bluff Creek, California. See PATTY.
Numerous 18-inch tracks of a Bigfoot with
an anatomically accurate clubfoot deformity
(Talipes equino-varus) in its right foot were
found near Bossburg, Washington, in October
1969.
Joe Medeiros and Dick Brown saw an 8- to 9-
foot Bigfoot standing under an oak tree at a
trailer park near The Dalles, Oregon, on June 2,
1971. Brown observed it through a telescopic
rifle sight and said there was a crest on its head.
It had muscular shoulders and walked with an
exaggerated swinging of its arms. The next day,
20-inch-long tracks were found in the crushed
grass.
On October 21, 1972, Alan Berry made a
high-quality audio recording of Bigfoot calls at
an altitude of 8,500 feet in the Sierra Nevada,
California. The vocalization includes a wide va-
riety of whistles and sounds, some quite hu-
manlike. A rough transcription might read:
“Gob-uh-gob-uh-gob, ugh, muy tail.” A pitch-
frequency analysis undertaken in 1977 by R.
Lynn Kirlin and Lasse Hertel indicated that
there was more than one speaker, that the ani-
mals were probably larger than adult male hu-
mans, and that their larynxes must be signifi-
cantly longer than a humans in order to
produce the sounds.
On June 10, 1982, U.S. Forest Service Pa-
trolman Paul Freeman saw a Bigfoot about 8
feet tall at relatively close range in the Umatilla
National Forest, Washington. On the day of the
sighting, plaster casts were made of tracks the
creature left. On June 16, two different sets of
prints were found a few miles away at Elk Wal-
low by Forest Service biologist Rodney Johnson
and U.S. Border Patrol tracker Joel Hardin, who
made casts. All of the prints show the impres-
sions of dermal ridges and sweat pores, features
that are consistent with the friction skin on the
soles of higher primates. Although Grover
Krantz considered the tracks genuine, Johnson
and Hardin felt they were hoaxed, since they
were too shallow, followed an unnaturally
straight line, had an oddly uniform stride and
pressure whether going uphill or down, ap-
peared and disappeared abruptly, and showed
abnormally pronounced dermal ridges.
In August 1987, Agnes Perkins and Charlotte
White were driving west along the Trans-
Canada Highway when they saw a man on the
side of the road ahead. As they got closer, they
realized it was a 7-foot Bigfoot covered with
black hair. It climbed up the steep embankment
on two legs. They had seen it for about forty-
five seconds.
Early in the morning of May 23, 1988, Susan
Ray Adams and Scott Stoness encountered what
they thought was a bear as they were going to
the public washrooms at the Crandell Lake
Campground in Waterton Lakes National Park
in Alberta. It snorted at them, and they ran for
their car. They turned on the car headlights and
could see that the animal was walking around
on two legs. Another couple had seen the same
thing and were similarly terrified. The animal
was 8 feet tall and taking huge strides, arms
swinging.
At Bella Coola, British Columbia, on No-
vember 11, 1989, Jimmy Nelson, his mother,
and a friend noticed a terrible odor and saw a 7-
to 8-foot creature approaching the back porch
where some deer meat was hanging. It returned
the following night, and the boys chased it to-
ward a nearby creek.
A five-second video recording of a Bigfoot
taken by a television film crew on August 28,
1995, in the Jedediah Smith Redwoods State
Park near Crescent City, California, is interest-
ing, if inconclusive. It shows a massive, hairy,
black creature with a distinctly erect penis.
Psychologist Matthew A. Johnson was hiking
with his family on July 1, 2000, near Oregon
Caves National Monument, Oregon, when they
smelled something skunky and heard something
making “whoa whoa whoa” sounds. Johnson got
a brief glimpse of a Bigfoot while he was off the
trail by himself.
The body imprint of what might have been a
Bigfoot’s forearm, hip, thigh, and heel was
found September 22, 2000, in the Skookum
Meadows area of Gifford Pinchot Forest, Wash-
ington, by a Bigfoot Field Researchers Organi-
zation (BFRO) expedition led by LeRoy Fish,
54 BIGFOOT
Derek Randles, and Richard Noll. More than
200 pounds of plaster were required to produce
a cast of the entire impression.
Artifacts: Numerous stone carvings referred to
as “anthropoid ape heads” have been found in
the Columbia River valley of Oregon and Wash-
ington. One was obtained from the Wakemap
mound near The Dalles, Oregon, which would
date it between 1500 B.G and A.D. 500. They are
about 6-7 inches long, carved from basalt, and
show a being with a fiat face, large eyes,
browridges, splayed nostrils, and full lips; some
have folds of loose flesh below the chin, and one
appears to have a sagittal crest. Some clearly rep-
resent human faces, mountain sheep, or seals,
but at least seven are apelike and could represent
Bigfoot. Myron Eells, “The Stone Age of Ore-

Possible explanations:
(1) An upright Brown bear ( Ursus arctos) or
Black bear ( Ursus americanus) might briefly
be misidentified. However, bears have short
hind legs, sloping shoulders, and visible ears.
Bigfoot prints do not look anything like bear
tracks, in which the first toe is the shortest
and the third toe the largest. Bear foreprints
and hindprints overlap, the big toes are on
the inside of the stride, and their feet turn
inward. Black bear hind feet are about 6-7
inches long and 3-5.5 inches wide. Brown
bear hind feet range from 10-11 inches long
and 6-6.5 inches wide for grizzlies to 16
inches long and 10 inches wide for Kodiaks.
Distortion from overlapping prints would
make these seem larger.
Artist’s conception of BiGFOOT. (William M. Rebsamen)
(2) Hoaxes of both sightings and tracks have
definitely occurred. However, the long stride
of many of the tracks would be difficult for
one individual to fake, and the dermal ridges
and sweat pores are unlikely touches for a
hoaxer (especially prior to the publicity they
were given after the discovery of this fea-
ture). Tracks are often found serendipitously
in remote places, where the likelihood of
their being found is equally remote. The
depth of some prints would also require a
hoaxer to exert as much as 450 pounds of
pressure in compact soil.
(3) An evolved Gigantopithecus black i, pro-
posed by Grover Krantz. This huge-jawed
Pleistocene ape lived as recently as 500,000
years ago in southern China and Vietnam,
while a smaller species, G. giganteus, dates to
9-6 million years ago in the Siwalik Hills of
India and Pakistan. It is known only from jaw
BIGFOOT 55
fragments and isolated teeth. It had a massive
jaw and low-crowned, flat molars with thick
enamel caps adapted for chewing coarse vege-
tation. Its estimated height was 9-10 feet tall
and weight was 900-1,200 pounds. However,
no weight-bearing bones have been recovered,
and it is possible that the animals teeth and
jaws were disproportionate to its body size.
Ivan Sanderson considered an evolved Gigan-
topithecus the best candidate for his proposed
category of NEO-GlANTS.
(4) A surviving, robust form of Homo heidel-
bergensis , an archaic human known from
Middle Pleistocene fossils in Europe and
Africa, suggested by Will Duncan. Named
from a mandible discovered in 1906 in a
gravel pit at Mauer near Heidelberg, Ger-
many, this human is thought to have lived
around 500,000 years ago.
(5) A surviving Paranthropus robustus , sug-
gested by Gordon Strasenburgh. The
youngest known remains of this early, exclu-
sively African hominid were found at
Swartkrans, South Africa, and are 850,000
years old. However, reasonable estimates of
its size, based on postcranial bones, range
from 95 to 145 pounds, making this an un-
likely Bigfoot candidate.
(6) Loren Coleman has suggested a surviving
Meganthropus , a little-known hominid genus
described from two partial mandibles with
large teeth found in Java in 1939 and 1941.
A handful of other fragmentary finds have
been included in this taxon, but there is no
consensus on its status. Many regard this an-
imal as belonging to Homo erectus, though
some consider it pathologically oversized.
(7) A Neanderthal ( Homo neanderthalensis)
population is unlikely, as these distinctively
cold-adapted hominids are not found out-
side Europe or West Asia any later than
30,000 years ago. However, if the Central
Asian Almas represents an extant Nean-
derthaloid group, individuals could have mi-
grated across Beringia in time to populate
North America. But its small stature (the av-
erage for males was 5 feet 6 inches tall)
seems to rule out this species.
(8) A surviving Homo erectus has been pro-
posed by Ray Crowe. Following an appear-
ance in East Africa 2 million years ago, erec-
tus hominids spread into Asia and possibly
into Europe. Their subsequent evolutionary
history is unclear, though recent evidence
suggests their persistence in Zhoukoudien,
China, until as recently as 250,000 years
ago. Few postcranial bones offer any
glimpse of H. erectus stature, though
femurs from East Africa indicate an average
height of 5 feet 7 inches for adult males —
much too small for the robust Bigfoot.
H. erectus also seems to have preferred open,
arid environments.
(9) A homegrown variety of North American
primate is extremely unlikely. The oldest pri-
matelike mammal, Purgatorius, appeared in
the West at the end of the Mesozoic and
continued through the Early Paleocene,
about 66-64 million years ago. Other North
American protoprimates were the Plesi-
adapoidea and Carpolestidae from the Early
Eocene; they had snouted faces and semi-
grasping feet, and some species were as large
as woodchucks. Fossils are mostly known
from the Rocky Mountain region, which at
that time consisted of lowland tropical for-
est. Recent molecular evidence indicates that
these were more closely related to Flying
lemurs (Order Dermoptera) than true pri-
mates. Also known from the beginning of
the Eocene (about 55 million years ago) are
the first members of the modern primates,
the lemurlike Notharctidae and the tarsier-
like Omomyidae, some of which apparently
were as large as medium-sized monkeys.
Forests shrunk with gradual cooling toward
the end of the Eocene, and these arboreal
species died off or migrated to South Amer-
ica. The genus Ekgmowechashala lingered
until the Late Oligocene (28 million years
ago) in Oregon and South Dakota. After
this, there is no evidence of any primate oc-
cupation in North America until modern
humans arrived, which archaeologists are
now reluctantly accepting occurred as early
as 40,000 years ago.

Bili Ape
Unknown PRIMATE of Central Africa.
Etymology: From the Bili Forest.
Physical description: Chimpanzee-like.
Habitat: Dense rain forest.
BILI APE 57
Distribution: Bili Forest, northeast Democra-
tic Republic of the Congo.
Significant sightings: An ape skull of unknown
type was found in the area around 1900 by an
unnamed explorer.
In March 2001, an expedition to the Bili For-
est by National Geographic Radio turned up
ape feces, a ground nest, and a large footprint in
the mud near a stream. Primatologist Richard
Wrangham concluded they were chimpanzee
traces, possibly an unknown variety.
Possible explanation: Unknown variety of
Chimpanzee ( Pan troglodytes ), perhaps related to
the KOOLOO-K AM B A.

BIRDS (Unknown)
Birds (Class Aves) are warm-blooded animals
that have no teeth, are covered with feathers,
and are wonderfully adapted for true flight. Zo-
ologists have long recognized that birds evolved
from reptiles, but with the relatively recent dis-
covery in China that some theropod dinosaurs
had feathers ( Sinosauropteryx and Caudipteryx ) ,
it seems likely that early birds (such as the well-
known Archaeopteryx of the Late Jurassic, 140
million years ago) emerged from these DI-
NOSAURS. Feathers are complex organs requiring
many different genes for their construction, and
consequently, it makes sense that they evolved
only once. But the feathered dinosaurs did not
fly; they apparently developed feathers either as
insulation to maintain body temperature, for
sexual display, or possibly as an aid in jumping
or gliding. When these animals acquired a
strong breastbone to anchor powerful flight
muscles, modified their forearms into wings, re-
duced their tailbones to a stump, and reengi-
neered the rest of their skeletons into an aerody-
namically sound structure, they became birds.
There are still many gaps in the avian fossil
record. Unfortunately, cryptozoology may not be
able to help fill them. None of the sixty-one mys-
tery birds in this section are explainable by the
survival of anything other than recent taxa, ex-
cept possibly Big Bird or the Thundeebied,
which some believe may involve an extant tera-
torn from 8 million years ago. Flightlessness,
found in such birds as the moa, is usually a late
adaptation by a bird that was capable of flight but
had few natural predators. The Dodo, Du,
Koau, Mihirung Paringmal, Reunion Soli-
taire, ROA-ROA, and VORDNPATRAare flightless.
The largest living bird is the flightless Ostrich
(. Struthio camelus ); males have been recorded up to
9 feet in height and weighing 345 pounds. The
heaviest flying birds are the Kori bustard ( Ardeotis
kori ) of Africa and the Great bustard ( Otis tarda)
of Europe and Asia, both of which can weigh
more than 40 pounds. The Wandering albatross
( Diomedea exulans ) has the largest wingspan of
any living bird; a specimen caught in the Tasman
Sea in 1965 had a wingspan of 1 1 feet 1 1 inches.
The seventy-four families of passerine birds,
also known as perching birds, contain more
than half of the world’s bird species.
Sixteen of the entries are birds that, though
known largely from myth and legend, might be
explainable by real species, either living or ex-
tinct. These include the giant Kaha, PlASA,
ROC, and SlMURTH and the smaller CALADEIUS
and Phoenix.
Nine entries are birds that have become extinct
recently but may have lingered past their official
extinction dates, such as the C AROLINA PARAKEET,
Great Auk, or Ivory-Billed Woodpecker
The remainder are birds about which there is
simply insufficient information to classify or to
verify as distinct species, such as the GOOD-
enough Island Bird or the Peruvian Wyttle-
LESS GUAN.

Physical description: As large as a calf or collie
dog. Black, like a Labrador retriever; often de-
scribed as jet-black or coal-black. Shaggy coat.
Occasionally said to be headless. Large, red or
green, glowing eyes. Foaming or slavering
mouth. Long teeth.
Behavior: Nocturnal. Often malevolent or
menacing. Screams, growls, or howls. Bad or
fiery breath reported frequently. Occasionally
acts as a guide or protector to travelers. Tends to
follow or run alongside people. Often appari-
tional in nature — seemingly real, but when a
witness tries to touch or strike it, nothing solid
is felt. Can appear or disappear suddenly. Some-
times grows bigger or shrinks before it disap-
pears. Guards churchyards and treasure. Said to
be an omen of death.
Habitat: Most often reported along roads or
country lanes; also graveyards, fields, barrows,
and downs. An association with waterways has
also been noted.
Distribution: In Europe, especially common
in Great Britain but also reported from Ireland,
France, Belgium, Italy, Croatia, Germany, Aus-
tria, Poland. In the United States, there have
been reports from Maryland, Mississippi, Mis-
souri, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee. Other re-
ports come from Canada, especially Nova Sco-
tia; Costa Rica; Argentina; and Australia.
Significant sightings: A fearsome Black dog ap-
peared inside a church in Bungay, Suffolk, En-
gland, on August 4, 1577, accompanied by
“fearful flashes of fire” during a violent thunder-
storm. It rushed down the aisle, killed two peo-
ple and injured a few others, then appeared 7

miles away at the church in Blythburgh, where
its claws left burn marks on the church door.
In 1928, a Trinity College student was fishing
in a river in County Londonderry, Northern Ire-
land, when a Black dog with blazing red eyes
came toward him in the shallow water. Terrified,
he climbed a tree, and the animal looked up at
him and snarled as it passed.
In 1949, a waterworker near Keresley, War-
wick, England, was confronted early one morn-
ing by a huge Black dog sitting on its haunches.
Its glowing eyes watched him as he edged
around it and ran away.
In the winter of 1959 or 1960, a twelve-year-
old boy and his mother saw a Black dog with a
huge head peering into their window on Sharpe
60 BLACK DOG
Street in South Baltimore, Maryland. Its eyes
were oval-shaped and bright red or yellowish.
Later, the boy went outside but could find no
tracks in the snow.
On April 19, 1972, British coastguardsman
Graham Grant was on watch at Gorleston, near
the harbor entrance to Great Yarmouth, Nor-
folk, England, when he saw a large, black hound
on the beach. It alternatively ran, then stopped
and looked around, and after a short time it
vanished. Grant said there was nowhere it might
have hidden.
On April 30, 1976, a black- and-brown dog
was seen in Abingdon, Massachusetts, feeding
on a Shetland pony it had killed.
On October 31, 1984, a Mr. Lee was driving
toward Molland, Devon, England, when he saw
a huge, black great dane run toward the road at
him. As Lee braked to a stop, the animal walked
up to the hood of the car, looked at him, and
vanished.
Victoria Rice-Heaps encountered a huge
Black dog with glowing red eyes as she was driv-
ing past Hodsock Priory near Worksop, Not-
tinghamshire, England, early in the morning of
May 1 1, 1991. It was about 18 inches taller than
a great dane and seemed to be dragging some-
thing across the road.
Possible explanations:
(1) Black feral Domestic dogs ( Canis famil-
iaris) ; the glowing red eyes might be an indi-
cation of opacity caused by cataracts, which
make the eyes shine red in reflected light.
(2) The odds are overwhelmingly in favor of
the Black dog being a paranormal — rather
than a biological — entity, more related to
ghosts than to dogs.
(3) British Big Cats, seen under imperfect
conditions, may have contributed to Black
dog folklore. However, the shaggy coat, the
tendency to follow humans, and noisy move-
ment argue against a cat.

Black Fish (Venomous)
Unknown FlSH of the Middle East.
Physical description: Small and black.
Behavior: Lethal, swift- acting bite.
Distribution: Shatt al Arab River, Iran and
Iraq.
Significant sightings: Said to have killed
twenty-eight people before 1975.
Possible explanations:
(1) Unknown relative of the Blackline fang-
blenny ( Meiacanthus nigrolineatus) , a blue-
and-yellow species with a black stripe along
its dorsal fin, suggested by Karl Shuker.
Found in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden,
this fish has a nonfatal, venomous bite and is
just under 4 inches long.
(2) The Stinging catfish ( Heteropneustes fos-
silis ), a black fish about 12 inches long with
poisonous spines in its pectoral fins, has
been introduced into the Shatt al Arab from
the Indian subcontinent. Its bite is not dan-
gerous, but its fins are.
(3) A Giant slender moray ( Thyrsoidea
macrura ) from the Red Sea. This fish grows
to 12 feet long, and its bites have never
proven fatal.

Black Lion
Melanistic big CAT of South Africa and West
Asia.
Physical description: Completely or partially
black Lion ( Panthera leo).
Distribution: Kruger National Park, South
Africa; the Zagros Mountains, Iran.
Significant sightings: In the 1880s, a dark
brown lion was killed by soldiers of the Luristan
Regiment. It was seen by Sir Henry Layard in
Esfahan, Iran.
In 1975, a partially black lion cub was born at
the Glasgow Zoo. It had a black chest and one
black leg.
Possible explanation: Black lion morphs have
never been verified.

Black Malayan Tapir
Melanistic variety of the Malayan tapir, a
Hoofed Mam m al, of Southeast Asia.
Scientific name: Tapirus indicus var. breve-
tianus, given by K. Kuiper in 1926.
Physical description: Malayan tapir that lacks
the distinctive white saddle on its back and
haunches.
Distribution: Near Babat, Sumatera Selatan
Province, Sumatra, Indonesia.
Present status: Only two specimens are known,
both collected in 1924 by K. Brevet of the Royal
Dutch-Indian Army. They both died before they
could be crossbred with normal tapirs.
Possible explanation: Either unusual melanistic
morphs or an unverified variety of the Malayan
tapir ( Tapirus indicus ) .

Black Sea Snake
Mystery SNAKE of West Asia.
Physical description: Dark brown above, white
below. Length, 82-98 feet. Snakelike head.
Behavior: Wriggles like a snake in the water.
Floats by rolling into a ball.
62 BLACK FISH
Distribution: Crimean shore of the Black Sea,
Ukraine.
Significant sighting: For forty minutes in the
spring of 1952, Vsevolod Ivanov watched a huge
snake swimming in Sordolik Bay of the Black Sea
near Planerskoye, Crimean Republic, Ukraine.

Black Shuck
BLACK Dog of southern England.
Etymology: Possibly from the Old English
scucca (“demon”) or from “shag” or “shaggy”
after its tousled coat.
Variant names: Old Shock (in Suffolk), Old
Shuck (in Norfolk), Shuck, Shucky dog.
Physical description: Size of a calf. Shaggy
black dog with glowing eyes. Some writers say it
has only one eye.
Behavior: Appears before bad weather. Ac-
companied by the sound of chains. Walks be-
hind people, growling. Follows cyclists. Said to
throw people down and break their legs.
Distribution: Norfolk and Suffolk, England.
Significant sighting: John Harries was fol-
lowed by a Black dog in November 1945 as he
cycled from East Dereham, Norfolk, to the
Royal Air Force (RAF) station at Swanton Mor-
ley. Whenever he stopped, the dog would stop,
and it kept pace with him even at 20 miles per
hour. When he got to the base, it vanished.

Black Tiger
Melanistic big CAT of the Indian subcontinent
and Southeast Asia.
Variant name: Bear tiger.
Physical description: The normal tiger stripes
are visible over a darkened ground color.
Distribution: Kerala, Orissa, Assam, and Ma-
nipur States, and Mizoram Union Territory,
India; Chittagong Division, Bangladesh; Bhamo
District, Myanmar.
Significant sightings: In 1772, a Black tiger
was killed in Kerala State, India. A portrait of it
was painted by noted British artist John Forbes.
In March 1 846, a Black tiger that had killed
a local villager was shot by a poisoned arrow in
the Chittagong Hill District, Bangladesh. The
stripes showed distinctly against a lighter black
ground.
On September 11, 1895, S. Capper and C. J.
Maltby spotted a Black tiger through a telescope
in the Cardamom Hills, Kerala State, India.
A Black tiger with no evidence of striping was
shot in 1915 near Dibrugarh, Assam State, India.
In the early 1970s, a dark tiger cub was born
to normal parents in the Oklahoma City Zoo. It
had a normal ground color, but it also had
smoky black pigmentation on its shoulders,
pelvis, and legs. Had it not been killed by its
mother shortly after its birth, it might have
turned completely melanistic.
Beginning in 1975 and 1976, a number of
sightings of Black tigers occurred in Similipal
Tiger Reserve, near Baripada, Orissa State, east-
ern India. On July 21, 1993, a boy killed in self-
defense a young, melanistic tigress in the village
of Podagad west of the reserve. The tiger’s black
ventral stripes had expanded and coalesced over
the tawny ground color, indicating a pseudo-
melanistic morph.
Present status: Many reports of all-black Tigers
(. Panthera tigris) exist, but no specimen or skin
showing true melanism has ever been submitted
for formal description. Melanism usually occurs
in tropical species such as the leopard and
jaguar, so a black tropical tiger morph would
not be considered genetically unusual.
Possible explanations:
(1) Misidentified black Leopard ( Panthera
pardus), such as the 12-foot black animal
captured alive in September 1934 near Di-
brugarh, Assam. However, most Black tiger
observations have been in close quarters or
when the animal was dead.
BLACKTIGER 63
(2) Tigers seen in shadow or covered in char-
coal, ash, or blood. However, the dark
stripes have been reported in most cases.
(3) A genuine but rare melanistic tiger morph.

Blood-Sweating Horse
Unknown horse (a HOOFED Mammai) of East
Asia.
Behavior: Bleeds from the shoulder when run-
ning at full speed. Said to be able to travel an in-
credible distance in one day.
Distribution: Tian Shan Range, Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region, China; formerly
ranged in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.
Significant sightings: An emperor of the Han
Dynasty (206 B.G-A.D. 200) sent armies to
catch this horse along the Silk Road trade route.
In August 2000, Japanese horse researcher
Hayato Shimizu took a photo of a horse in the
western Tian Shan that shows blood running
from its shoulders.
Possible explanations:
(1) The bleeding is caused by some sort of
parasitic worm.
(2) The horse’s arteries stand out under exer-
tion, producing a reddish flush.
(3) The horse actually bleeds under extreme
exertion.
(4) An unknown horse breed, similar to the
recently discovered Nangchen and Riwoche
horses of Tibet.

Blue Horse
Odd blue-colored horse (a HOOFED Mammai)
of South Africa.
Physical description: Shoulder height, just
under 5 feet. Smooth, blue-mauve skin. Com-
pletely hairless. Buff-colored face. One large,
beige patch on its back. Tail like a pigs.
Behavior: Can be broken in for riding. Per-
forms well in harness.
Distribution: South Africa.
Significant sighting: In South Africa in 1860,
a man named Lashmar spotted a blue-colored
horse in a herd of QUAGGAS ( Equus quaggd). He
captured it and sent it to Cape Town, where it
was sold and sent to London in 1863. It was rid-
den as a fox-hunting horse on Lord Stamford’s
estate, examined by Charles Spooner at the
Royal Veterinary College in London, then sold
in February 1 868 to a Mr. Moffat for exhibition
at the Crystal Palace. By then its original blue
coloration had faded to gray.
Possible explanation: A mutant form of a gene
controlling hair development could produce
hairlessness, according to Karl Shuker. Presence
of the pigment eumelanin in combination with
others might result in a blue color. Where the
horse came from or why it was accompanying a
herd of quaggas is unknown.

Blue Men of the Minch
MERBEING of Scotland.
Physical description: Blue skin. Long, gray
face.
64 B’LIAN
Behavior: Swims alongside ships to lure sailors
into the water but can be overwhelmed by a
skilled rhymer or riddler. Able to conjure
storms.
Habitat: Underwater caverns.
Distribution: The Minch, the strait between
the Isle of Lewis in the Hebrides and Scotland,
especially off the Shiant Islands.
Possible explanations:
(1) A personification of dangerous waters.
(2) A folk memory of Tuareg slaves from
North Africa taken to Scotland in the ninth
century by Norse pirates and slave traders.
These nomadic people are still known as
Blue Men today because of their indigo
robes. The wide-ranging Vikings did appar-
ently visit North Africa and may have even
engaged in some slave trading there. How-
ever, equating the two Blue Men groups
seems a stretch.

Blue Tiger
Bluish big CAT of East Asia.
Physical description: Well-defined black stripes
over a grayish-blue ground color. Deep blue on
chest and ribcage.
Distribution: Rongcheng area, Fujian
Province, China.
Significant sighting: In September 1910,
hunter and missionary Harry R. Caldwell saw a
tiger with a bluish-gray ground color and deep
blue underparts near Rongcheng. He had it in
his rifle sights but could not pull the trigger be-
cause there were two young boys nearby who
might be endangered.
Present status: Other individuals may exist in
the area if this variety entered the gene pool.
Possible explanation: Karl Shuker suggests a
Tiger {Pant h era tigris) may have possessed a re-
cessive melanistic mutant allele and a recessive
dilute mutant allele to produce a morph called a
“blue dilution.”

its snout that glows in the dark.
Distribution: Northern Cameroon.
Significant sighting: Jonathan Downes found
several of these tree frogs for sale at an animal
fair in Newton Abbot, Devon, England, in July
1997. Later on, he discovered that there was no
such frog known to science.

Bobo
Sea MONSTER of the North Pacific Ocean.
Etymology: Possibly from the Portuguese bobo
(“silly”) because of the reaction to eyewitness re-
ports. Portuguese-speaking fishermen were
common in the area in the 1940s.
Distribution: Cape San Martin and Monterey
Bay, California.
Significant sighting: On November 7, 1946, a

nearly 3 feet long. Short, black legs. Webbed,
clawed feet.
Behavior: Call is like the roar of an angry bull.
Said to feed on lambs and otters.
Distribution: Argyll and Bute, Scotland.
Possible explanations:
(1) Unknown species of Loon (Family
Gaviidae).
(2) The Yellow-billed loon ( Gavia adamsii) is
an occasional visitant to Scotland. It has a
striking white bill, but it is not at all eaglelike.
First-winter birds have much paler and whiter
coloration about the neck than other loons.

Bornean Tiger
Unrecognized big CAT of Southeast Asia.
Distribution: Borneo, Indonesia.
Significant sightings: In the late 1990s, Erik
Meijaard collected scattered evidence from the
north, east, and interior of Borneo that tigers ex-
isted there in recent times. Tiger skins, skulls,
and teeth are in the possession of some of the in-
digenous peoples, and sightings have occurred
as recently as 1995.
Possible explanations: Either a remnant popu-
lation of Tigers ( Panthera tigris) has existed on
the island since the Pleistocene or, at some point
in the recent past, it was introduced, perhaps by
the sultans of Sarawak, Sabah, or Brunei.

66 BOOAA
Bothrodon pridii
Supposed giant SNAKE of South America.
Physical description: Based on the misidentifi-
cation of an alleged 2.5-inch-long fossil poison
fang found in the Gran Chaco area of South
America in the 1920s and presumed to be from
an unknown snake. In 1939, the object was pos-
itively identified as a prong from the shell of the
Chiragra spider conch ( Lambis chirargd).

Brachystomos
WllDM AN of East Africa.
Etymology : Greek, “narrow mouth.”
Physical description: Narrow throat.
Behavior: Drinks with the aid of straws.
Distribution: East Africa.
Possible explanation: Bernard Heuvelmans

Bray Road Beast
Black Dog or Werewolf of Wisconsin.
Etymology: After rural Bray Road, the scene of
many encounters.
Physical description: Height, 5 feet 7 inches.
Weight, 150 pounds. Brownish-silver hair or
fur. Glowing, yellowish eyes. Pointed ears.
Wolflike muzzle. Fangs. Wide chest and shoul-
ders. Muscular forelegs. Fingers with claws.
Hind legs oddly shaped and longer than a dogs.
Tail like a husky or German shepherd dog.
Behavior: Walks uncertainly on two feet.
Runs on all fours. Growls. Holds food with
palms facing up. Chases people.
Tracks: Doglike, 4 inches wide, and 4-5
inches long.
Distribution: East of Elkhorn, Wisconsin.
Significant sightings: In the fall of 1989, Lori-
anne Endrizzi saw a wolflike creature kneeling
by the side of Bray Road. It seemed to be eating
something.
Farmer Scott Bray encountered a “strange-
looking dog” that left tracks in his cow pasture
in September or October 1989.
On October 31, 1991, Doristine Gipson was
attacked by a large animal as she was stopped
along the road. The creature hit the car trunk as
she drove away.
Along Bray Road on the night of August 13,
1999, a woman and her family saw what at first
looked like a deer, but it was about 5 feet tall
and had glowing, red eyes. It approached the car
steadily to within 50 feet before they drove
away.
Possible explanations:
(1) Hoaxes.
(2) Black bears ( Ursus americanus) are not
normally found in the area.
(3) Coyotes ( Canis latrans) are too small.
BRAY ROAD BEAST 67
(4) The Gray wolf ( Canis lupus) is not as ro-
bustly built, never walks upright, and is not
known in the area.
(5) A hybrid dog x wolf. These hybrids have
become fashionable in the United States,
where some estimates place the number at
600,000. Second-generation hybrids tend to
be strongly territorial, prone to roaming, and
shy of people. Wolf x German shepherd hy-
brids tend to be less stable than wolf x mala-
mute or husky crosses.
(6) A paranormal Entity.
(7) Escaped baboon of some type.

Brentford Griffin
Dubious flying Griffin of England.
Physical description: The size of a dog. Dark
color. Long muzzle. Wings. Four legs.
Habitat: Said to live on an island in the
Thames River.
Distribution: Brentford, Greater London,
England.
Significant sightings: In June or July 1984,
Kevin Chippendale was walking down Braemar
Road, close to the Griffin Pub, in Brentford
when he glimpsed what looked like a dog with
wings flying across the street ahead of him. He
saw the same thing at the same spot in late Feb-
ruary 1985. Other alleged witnesses came for-
ward, but the media soon lost interest.
Present status: In 1995, novelist Robert
Rankin finally admitted that he was responsible
for some, if not all, of the reports and publicity
as a joke.

Physical description: Puma- or lionlike cat.
Ranges in size from a terrier to a great dane.
Length, 3-5 feet. Shoulder height, 18 inches-2
feet 6 inches. Brown, rusty, gray, or sandy but
often pure black. Sometimes striped or spotted.
Flat face. Ears are sometimes tufted. Short, or
long, powerful legs. Large paws. Pointed tail is
of variable length, sometimes with a white tip.
Specific descriptions vary widely. Witnesses
have also referred to similarities with a cheetah,
monkey, tiger, partially striped cat, bear, or Ger-
man shepherd dog. There may be two varieties
in Scotland, both black but in two different
sizes. See Kehas Cat.
Behavior: Snarls, howls, roars, or screams.
Kills and sometimes eats livestock and game.
Dogs are terrified of it.
Tracks: Cat- or doglike. Up to 5 inches long,
which is larger than a German shepherds. Some
of the tracks show claws, which rules out an ar-
boreal habitat and most often indicates a dog;
however, many cats keep their claws extruded to
facilitate movement and balance when sprinting,
leaping, or walking on certain types of terrain.
Habitat: Fields, gardens, woods, hills, streets.
Distribution: In many parts of Great Britain
but especially Hampshire, Surrey, and East and
West Sussex in the southeast; Devon and Corn-
wall in the southwest; Lancashire, Cheshire,
Nottinghamshire, and North Yorkshire; Ceredi-
gion in Wales; and Renfrewshire, Ayrshire,
Strathclyde, Highland, and East Lothian in
Scotland.
BRITISH BIG CAT 69
Significant sightings: Sheep kills in May 1810
at Ennerdale Water, Cumbria, England; in 1905
at Great Badminton, South Gloucestershire,
England; and in January 1927 in Inverness,
Highland, Scotland, might have been depreda-
tions by big cats. See Auen Big Dog.
On July 18, 1963, a truck driver named
David Back stopped in Oxleas Wood, Shooters
Hill, Bexley, Greater London, to help what he
thought was an injured dog. However, the ani-
mal, which had long legs and a curled tail,
jumped up and ran off into the woods. Later,
police reported that a cheetahlike animal had
jumped over the hood of a squad car. A search
covered some 850 acres and turned up some
clawed tracks.
On September 20, 1976, Alec Jamieson of
Skegness, Lincolnshire, England, saw a sandy-
colored cat about 5 feet long that left 2. 5 -inch x
3 -inch tracks.
Donald Mackenzie and his son were hunting
foxes December 12, 1977, when they saw and
wounded a large cat swimming the River Naver
near Bettyhill, Highland, Scotland. It had red
eyes, a dark coat, and a white chest. They chased
it in their Land Rover. It outpaced them, though
Mackenzie managed to shoot it again.
Using a sheep’s head as bait, Ted Noble cap-
tured a female puma alive near Cannich, High-
land, Scotland, October 29, 1980. However, cat
sightings and livestock killings persisted after-
ward, indicating there were other predators in
the area. In fact, the animal captured by Noble
turned out to be elderly, lame, well-groomed,
overweight, and so tame it purred the next day
for visitors at the Highland Wildlife Park, where
it was taken. Some suspected that an illegal ex-
otic-pet owner had pulled a fast one by planting
an unwanted puma in Nobles trap.
In November 1981, a large gray cat was seen
by many witnesses at Tonmawr, Neath Port Tal-
bot, Wales. Steven Joyce managed to get some
photos of a large cat at a distance and two
smaller ones at close range. Di Francis visited
the area later, taking a photo of a 4-foot black
cat and finding prints 5 inches long.
On June 16, 1999, a large, orange-and-yellow
cat with black stripes reared up on its hind legs
and attacked a forklift truck driven by Raymond
Cibor near Armthorpe, Doncaster, England.
Cibor said it looked like a tiger, but police
found tracks later identified as a dogs.
In September 1999, video footage of a large
black cat was captured by a closed-circuit secu-
rity camera at a brick-making plant near
Telford, Shropshire, England. Security guards
had seen a 6-foot panther twice before.
Shortly after midnight one night in Decem-
ber 1999, Alastair Skinner was driving near
Rogie Falls, Highland, Scotland, when he got
within 5 feet of what looked like a black panther
with a long tail.
A 5-foot cat allegedly clawed and bit eleven-
year-old Joshua Hopkins near Trellech, Car-
marthenshire, Wales, on August 23, 2000. His
wounds were treated at a nearby medical center.
Elaine Ainslie saw a black panther-like cat
while she was walking her dog in a field in Or-
niston, East Lothian, Scotland, on July 19,
2001. It had a long tail and was very muscular.
She picked up her dog and backed away until it
was out of sight.
Vicar Kenneth Wakefield observed a glossy
black panther crossing a road near Launceston,
Cornwall, on September 25, 2001. It was about
6 feet long and 3 feet high at the shoulder.
Possible explanations: Although classed as a big
cat (with pumas, leopards, and lions), the
British big cat might be explained in some in-
stances by small cats (wildcats, lynxes, or feral
domestics). When seen at a distance, sizes are
difficult to estimate. Because descriptions vary
so widely, a multicausal explanation seems
likely.
(1) The Scottish wildcat ( Felis silvestris
grampia) was common in England, Wales,
and Scotland until the end of the fifteenth
century. It was exterminated everywhere in
Britain by the 1860s except in Scotland,
where after World War I, it began to increase
in numbers. It grows up to 3 feet 6 inches in
length, slightly larger than a domestic cat.
The coat is a gray-brown or tabby color,
with white on the throat. Its head is broader,
teeth sharper, limbs longer, and tail shorter
than a domestic cats. It has a bushy, blunt-
ended tail with a well-defined pattern of
black stripes. The average weight of males is
70 BRITISH BIG CAT
1 1 pounds. Primarily nocturnal, the wildcat
feeds mostly on rodents, as well as rabbits
and birds. It inhabits woodlands (especially
deciduous or mixed), scrubland, seacoasts,
and rocky areas with low human density.
Some mystery cats could be surviving popu-
lations of this wildcat in pockets of England
and Wales.
(2) Feral Domestic cats ( Felis silvestris catus)
undoubtedly account for many sightings;
among them are the smaller gray cats of
Tonmawr, Wales. Feral cats do not grow ap-
preciably larger in the wild than in domes-
ticity. The largest recorded weight is 42
pounds. An odor of brussels sprouts charac-
teristic of feral cats has been noted in some
sightings.
(3) Hybrid feral domestic cats x Scottish or
European wildcats ( Felis silvestris silvestris).
Mating is common between these closely re-
lated species. Colin Matheson has suggested
that a wildcat strain exists among feral cats
in parts of Wales. Between 1873 and 1904,
the Scottish wildcat was experimentally
crossed with several domestic breeds, but the
hybrids proved too wild for domestication.
Color or size variations are not necessarily
evidence of a hybrid, which tend to be
smaller, with tapered tails, fused black band-
ing, and white markings. See Kellas Cat.
(4) Hybrid feral domestic cats x escaped
Jungle cats ( Felis chaus ), suggested by Karl
Shuker. Such hybrids are bred in the United
States and have been foundation registered
since 1995. Called a chausie, this breed is
known for its nearly 6-foot vertical leap,
large size (14-18 inches at the shoulder),
tufted ears, speed, and a weight of 20
pounds or more.
(5) At least four introduced specimens of the
Leopard cat ( Felis bengalensis) were shot or
found dead in England between 1984 and
1994. This Asian cat can also mate with do-
mestic cats to produce spotted hybrids,
which have been bred in the United States
since 1 963 as the Bengal variety.
(6) Four types of escaped or released exotic
pets that are now naturalized and breeding
in the wild could be responsible for mystery
cat sightings: a tawny or gray Puma ( Puma
concolor ), 5 feet long with a 2-foot tail,
weight 200 pounds, small head, neck rela-
tively long, short ears, large paws — even a
hypothetical melanistic (black) variety; a
Eurasian lynx ( Lynx lynx), 3 feet 4 inches
long with a 4.5—1 1-inch tail, long limbs,
black-tufted ears, golden eyes, yellowish-gray
to reddish-brown color; a Leopard ( Panthera
pardus ), 6 feet 6 inches long with a 3-foot
tail, spots or melanistic coat, elongate and
muscular body; and a female Lion ( Panthera
led), identifiable by a black tuft at the end of
the tail. This could especially be true after
the 1976 Dangerous Wild Animals Act re-
quired special licenses for exotic pets. (The
1981 Wildlife and Countryside Act offered
stricter penalties.) Irresponsible owners may
have released the animals rather than pay for
a license. The Clouded leopard ( Neofelis neb -
ulosd) and Cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) are
other exotic possibilities.
(7) Big cats (pumas and panthers) kill by
sinking their claws into the victims head or
hindquarters (usually deer), while breaking
of the neck is used for stronger adversaries;
consumption of the victims abdomen, lack
of skeletal damage, and location of the car-
cass in a secluded spot are also characteristic.
Small cats (lynxes and wildcats) subsist pri-
marily on rabbits and rodents, rarely attack-
ing larger prey.
(8) Feral Domestic dogs ( Canis familiarid) or
Red foxes ( Vulpes vulpes). When seen from a
distance, many dog breeds can appear cat-
like — especially those with small heads,
rounded ears, and short legs. Packs of stray
dogs can quickly leave a sheep devoid of
flesh. Large droppings found at a deer kill in
Scotland in 1998 contained fox DNA. Mas-
sive pawprints (5 inches or more) are more
likely indicative of a dog (unless the cat’s feet
are vastly out of proportion to its body
length).
(9) Skulls that have been found turned out
to be from a leopard-skin rug (discovered be-
hind a hedge on Dartmoor in January 1988)
and from a wall-mounted tiger trophy
(found on Exmoor in 1993).
BRITISH BIG CAT 71
(10) Escaped Wolverines (Gulo gulo) are oc-
casionally found in portions of Wales and
southern England. The world’s largest
weasel, it can grow to 4 feet long and 14-17
inches at the shoulder.
(11) A surviving pumalike Pleistocene felid,
such as the lion-sized, short-tailed Scimitar-
toothed cat ( Homotherium ). However, it is
unlikely that such an animal could persist
virtually unnoticed by hunters and livestock
owners for thousands of years when the
smaller Scottish wildcat was nearly extermi-
nated.
(12) An unknown species of big cat, pro-
posed by Di Francis, though it would have
to account for a nearly impossibly wide
range of colors, anatomy, and behaviors.
(13) A surviving indigenous variety of
Eurasian lynx ( Lynx lynx) that did not die
out at the end of the Pleistocene.
(14) Other escaped or released exotic ani-
mals have accounted for cat reports, includ-
ing a Binturong ( Arctictis binturong ), Spotted
hyena ( Crocuta crocuta ), and Eurasian badger
(. Meles meles).

Brosnie
Freshwater Monster of Russia.
Etymology: After the lake.
Physical description: Serpentine. Length,
13-16 feet. Fish- or snakelike head. Large eyes.
Enormous tail.
Distribution: Lake Brosno (250 miles northwest
of Moscow), Tver Region, European Russia.
Significant sightings: A monster tradition dates
back to 1854.
In late 1 996, tourists from Moscow snapped a
photo of the monster after their seven-year-old
son shouted that he had seen a dragon in the lake.
Possible explanation: The Sturgeon ( Acipenser
sturio ) often grows to 1 1 feet 6 inches long, with
outsize specimens reaching 19 feet. Some indi-
viduals are thought to live as long as 100 years.
It is found in the Baltic Sea and spawns in rivers
that drain into it. The Tver’ Region would be a
bit remote for this species.

Buffalo Lion
Maneless big CAT of East Africa.
Etymology: After its preference for large prey
such as buffalo.
Variant names: River lion; Tsavolion.
Physical description: Male lion without a
mane. Length, 9 feet 8 inches, including tail.
Weight, around 400 pounds.
Behavior: Solitary. Adept at attacking large
prey.
Distribution: Kenya.
Significant sightings: The famous pair of
maneless, man-eating lions of Tsavo, Kenya,
were responsible for killing 140 railway workers
during a nine-month period in 1898. Now on
exhibit at the Field Museum in Chicago, these
The maneless, man-eating lions that terrorized Tsavo,
Kenya, in 1898. (Field Museum of Natural History,
Chicago)
large males were shot by Chief Engineer John
Henry Patterson in December.
In 1998, two maneless male lions were pho-
tographed in Tsavo National Park after bringing
down a buffalo cow.
Possible explanations:
(1) Manelessness among male Lions ( Pan -
thera led) could be due to hormonal prob-
lems or genetic defects. The condition may
even constitute a form of natural selection in
response to the preference by big-game
hunters for lions with impressive manes.
(2) A surviving Cave lion (7? /. spelaea ), a
Middle Pleistocene felid from Southern Eu-
rope, although it was much heavier, ranging
from 550 to 1,100 pounds.

Bulgarian Lynx
The Eurasian lynx ( Lynx lynx) is thought to have
become extinct in Bulgaria in the 1940s, but
unconfirmed reports indicate it persists in some
areas. Increases in ungulate populations and
reintroductions of this Cat in other parts of Eu-
rope may encourage its return.

Bunyip
Mystery MARSUP IAL of Australia.
Etymology: Probably derived from the Aus-
tralian Banib . A “monster of Aboriginal legend,
supposed to haunt water-holes; any freak or im-
postor,” according to G. A. Wilkes, Dictionary of
Australian Colloquialisms , 3d ed. (Sydney, Aus-
tralia: Sydney University Press, 1990). The form
Bahnyip appeared in the Sydney Gazette in 1812.
Bernard Heuvelmans thought the word derived
from Bunjil, the supreme being of the Victorian
Aborigines. The name is widely used in Victoria
and New South Wales and was first heard by
whites in the Sydney area. By 1852, the word
had become a synonym for “impostor” or “hum-
bug” in Sydney. The term bunyip aristocracy
refers to snobbish Australian conservatives.
Variant names: Banib, Bunnyar (in Western
Australia), Bunyup, Burley beast, Dongus (in

Macquarie, New South Wales).
Physical description: According to Tony Healy
and Paul Cropper, about 60 percent of the sight-
ings resemble seals or swimming dogs, and 20
percent are long-necked creatures with small
heads. (The remainder are too ambiguous to
categorize.)
Seal- dog variety — Seal-like. Length, 4-6 feet.
Shaggy, black or brown hair. Round head and
whiskers like a seals, otters, or bulldogs. Shin-
ing eyes. Prominent ears. No tail.
Long-necked variety — Length, 5-15 feet.
Black or brown fur. Head like a horses or an
emus. Large ears. Small tusks. Elongated,
maned neck about 3 feet long, with many folds
of skin. Four legs. Three toes. Horselike tail.
Behavior: Amphibious. Nocturnal. Swims
swiftly with fins or flippers. Loud, roaring call.
Eats crayfish. Lays eggs in platypus nests in un-
derwater burrows. Said by the Aborigines to be
a guardian water spirit that eats women and
children and causes sickness.
Tracks: Three-toed. Emulike.
Habitat: Lakes, rivers, and swamps.
Distribution: Traditions range throughout the
continent, with sightings centered in Victoria,
southern New South Wales, and eastern South
Australia.
Significant sightings: In June 1801, mineralo-
gist Joseph Charles Bailly of the French Le Geo-
graphe Expedition reported hearing the bellow
of some large animal in the Swan River, Western
Australia.
Hamilton Hume and James Meehan found
skulls and bone fragments of amphibious ani-
mals the day after they discovered Lake
Bathurst, New South Wales, in April 1818.
The earliest sightings by a colonist were at
Lake Bathurst by Edward Smith Hall (later a
founder of the Bank of New South Wales), who
saw both the seal-dog and the long-necked vari-
eties. In November 1821, Hall saw a black Bun-
yip with a bulldogs head thrashing in the water
for five minutes. In December 1822, he was
drying himself off after bathing in the eastern
end of the lake when he saw a 3-foot, black head
and neck gliding along the surface for about 300
yards. Some of the reports in the lake of animals
with bulldoglike heads that made noises like a
porpoise were possibly prompted by seals, which
are known to have migrated to the nearby Mul-
ware River in 1947.
Employees of George Holder (or Hopper)
saw two horselike Bunyips in Paika Lake, New
South Wales, in the 1840s.
Atholl Fletcher found a fresh skull along the
lower Murrumbidgee River, New South Wales,
in 1846. The top of the cranium, the front of the
snout, and the lower jaw were missing. The cra-
nium was about 9 inches long. The eye sockets
were abnormally close to the upper jaw. No other
bones were present. It was first examined by
James Grant, who considered it to be a fetal skull
of an unknown animal. William S. Macleay in
Sydney also considered it to be from a young an-
imal, possibly a fetus; comparing it to a fetal
mare’s skull, he thought it most likely belonged
to a deformed colt. Based on an illustration, Sir
Richard Owen in England pronounced it a calf’s
skull. It was taken to the Australian Museum in
Sydney but has long since vanished. The Aborig-
inal name for the animal was said to be Katenpai.
Geologist E. J. Dunn observed several ani-
mals swimming in the flooded Murrumbidgee
River near Gundagai in 1850.
A naturalist named Stocqueler reported
“freshwater seals” in the Goulburn and Murray
Rivers, New South Wales, in 1857.
Horsemen saw a whitish, dog-sized animal in
1886 along the River Molonglo, Australian
Capital Territory.
On September 8, 1949, L. Keegan and his
wife reported they had seen a 4-foot animal with
shaggy ears several times over the past two weeks
in the Lauriston Reservoir, Victoria. They
claimed it used its ears in swimming through
the water at tremendous speed.
In the 1960s, Jack Mitchell collected many re-
ports by Aborigines, farmers, and tourists of a
seal-dog Bunyip in the Macquarie River between
Wellington and Warren, New South Wales.
A roaring animal that splattered mud around
the bank of the Nerang River was heard near
Gilston, Queensland, in 1965.
BUNYIP 75
Present status: Widely believed in as a partially
supernatural being by the Aborigines of south-
eastern Australia at the time of white settlement.
There are few modern sightings, and most are
vague or fanciful. The long-necked variety of
Bunyip has not been reported since the nine-
teenth century and may be extinct.
Possible explanations:
(1) Australian fur seals (Ar otocephalus pusillus
doriferus) or Australian sea lions ( Neophoca
cinerea) that stray inland through the river
systems might explain some sightings of the
seal-dog Bunyip. In the nineteenth century,
these were known to travel many miles up
the Murray, Shoalhaven, and Murrumbidgee
Rivers. Elephant seals ( Mirounga leonind)
were also known along the coast. Either of
these animals seen unexpectedly in an un-
usual habitat could be misidentified.
(2) An unknown form of freshwater seal
endemic to southeastern Australia.
(3) Booming calls of the Brown bittern
( Botaurus poiciloptilus) of Victoria and New
South Wales have been attributed to the Bun-
yip. One of its nicknames is the “bunyip
bird.”
(4) The Musk duck ( Biziura lobata ) was re-
sponsible for one report in Sydney in 1960.
(5) Some reports may have involved large
Murray cod {Maccu llochella peelii peelii ),
which grow to more than 5 feet.
(6) The Saltwater crocodile ( Crocodylus
porosus ), the largest living reptile, is found in
northern Australia, but it may have been
known to Aborigines in the south in pre-
colonial times, forming the basis for a Bun-
yip legend. Mature males average 14-16 feet
long and are generally dark, with lighter tan
or gray areas.
(7) An Australian version of the long-necked
Freshwater Monster.
(8) Aboriginal legends of surviving Quater-
nary marsupials. Two candidates are the ter-
restrial, herbivorous, tapir-snouted Palor-
chestes, suggested by Tim Flannery and
Michael Archer, said to have been the size of
a bull, or Diprotodon optatum , the largest
known marsupial, about 10 feet long with a
3-foot skull, suggested by C. W. Anderson
and Karl Shuker. Neither were amphibious,
however.
(9) An unknown species of otterlike marsupial.

Bu-Rin
Giant SNAKE of Southeast Asia.
Physical description: Length, 40-50 feet.
Behavior: Aquatic. Aggressive. Attacks swim-
mers and small boats.
Distribution: Near Putao, Myanmar.

Burn
Unknown LIZARD of Central Asia.
Etymology: Apatani and Nisi (Sino-Tibetan)
word, possibly from its call.
Physical description: Roundish, elongated
body. Length, 11-14 feet. Mottled blue-black
above. Broad white band on the underside.
Head, 20 inches. One account gives it three
plates on the head, one on the top and on each
side. Eyes are close behind a flat-tipped snout.
Flat teeth, except for a single pair of large,
pointed teeth in both the upper and lower jaws.
Forked tongue. Neck, 3 feet. Three lines of
short spines run down its back and sides. Back,
1 8 inches wide. One account said it has legs 20
inches long with clawed feet, while another only
gave it paired lateral flanges. Round, tapering
tail 3-5 feet long and fringed at the base.
Behavior: Completely aquatic. Raises its head
out of the water occasionally. Basks in the sun
on the bank in the summer. Remains in the
mud when the swamps dry up. Makes a hoarse,
bellowing noise. Does not eat fishes. Young are
born alive in the water. Can grab a man with its
tail and drag him underwater.
Distribution: Swamps and lakes near Ziro in the
Apatani Valley, Arunachal Pradesh Union Terri-
tory, India; 50 miles to the southwest in the Dafla
hills, Arunachal Pradesh Union Territory, India.
Significant sightings: In 1945 and 1946, James
Phillip Mills and Charles Stonor collected de-
scriptions of the Burn from the Apatani people,
who are said to have killed the last of them in
their area when they were draining swamps for
rice cultivation.
In 1948, Ralph Izzard and Charles Stonor vis-
ited a swamp in the Dafla hills near Chemgeng in
the hopes of finding a living Burn but returned
with conflicting stories from the Nisi people.
Present status: It may still be possible to find
skeletal remains of the animals in the Apatani
Valley, since the precise kill spots are still known.
Possible explanations:
(1) A surviving dinosaur of some type, sug-
gested by Ralph Izzard.
(2) An unknown species of Monitor lizard
( Varanus sp.), suggested by Roy Mackal.
(3) An unknown species of Crocodile (Order
Crocodylia), suggested by Tim Dinsdale.
(4) A large, swamp-dwelling Lungfish
(Order Lepidosireniformes) would explain
the Bums ability to keep submerged in
mud, according to Karl Shuker. The body
structure also matches a lungfish more than
a reptile. Its bellow might be caused by its
ventilating air.
(5) An unknown species of Bonytongue fish
similar to the Pirarucu ( Arapaima gigas) of
South America, which also has an air blad-
der fashioned into a lung.

Significant sightings: A crew member of the
ship Columbia under American fur trader Capt.
Robert Gray was the first to report a Caddy
sight ing in 1791.
Osmond Fer gusson wat ched a 25-foot animal
with a long neck near the Queen Charlotte Is-
lands, British Columbia, on June 26, 1897.
In September 1905 or 1906, Philip H. Welch
saw a brown animal with a 6- to 8-foot neck
from a dist ance of 100 yards away in Johnst one
St r ait . It had t wo bumps on it s head t hat wer e 5
inches high and rounded on t op.
F. W. Kemp and his wife and son wat ched an
80-foot maned animal while they were sitting
on the Chatham Island beach, British Colum-
bia, on August 10, 1932.
On September 23, 1933, Dorothea Hooper
and a neighbor observed a serpentine animal
with a serrated back cavorting in Cadboro Bay
about 400 yards dist ant . It cr eat ed a commot ion
in the water as it swam out to sea.
Maj. W. H. Langley and his wife were sailing
in Haro Strait on Oct ober 1, 1933, when they
heard a loud grunt off Chatham Island. They
saw t he back of a huge, dar k-gr een cr eat ur e wit h
serrated markings on the top and sides.
Charles F. Eagles sketched a 60-foot animal
t hat he saw in Oak Bay on Oct ober 14, 1933. It
had crocodile-like spines on its neck.
On December 3, 1933, Justice of the Peace
G. F. Parkyn of Bedwell Harbour was one of
twelve people watching from Pender Island as
an animal with a large, horselike head and neck
gulped down a duck t hat had just been shot by
Cyr il Andr ews.
In 1936, E. J. Stephenson and his wife and
son watched a yellow-and-bluish, 90-foot -long,
3-foot -thick animal crawling over a reef into a
lagoon on Saturna Island.
A 10- to 12-foot carcass of apparently a
young Caddy was r emoved ff om t he st omach of
a sperm whale, photographed, and displayed for
a while at Naden Harbour whaling station in
1937. The photo shows it stretched out on
79
packing cases. It was about 10 feet long, with a
camel-like head, traces of flippers, and a pad-
dling tail. The carcass was allegedly shipped off
t o t he Field Museum in Chicago, but t here is no
r ecor d of it s ar r ival.
A Canadian naval officer was fishing in an
open boat off Esquimalt Harbour in November
1950 when a 30-foot Caddy appeared and cre-
at ed a heavy wash. It swam wit h an undulat ing
motion using large flippers on either side. It
snapped its teeth together once before it dived
aft er t went y-five seconds.
On February 12, 1953, R. D. Cockburn, C.
P. Crawford, and Ron Loach saw an animal
with three humps off Qualicum Beach for five
minutes. Two other men got into a boat and
rowed within 20 feet, but it submerged and
reappeared 100 yards away. Its head was dog-
shaped and had two horns.
In late November 1959, David Miller and Al-
fred Webb came within 30 feet of an animal
with a 10-foot neck sticking straight up out of
the water off Discovery Island. It had coarse
brown fur, red eyes, and small ears.
A 16-inch-long juvenile Caddy was caught in
a net by William Hagelund in 1968 off De
Courcy Island, but it was thrown back It had
spiny teeth, a saw-toothed ridge of plates along
it s backbone, and a bilobat e t ail. A soft , yellow
fuzz cover ed it s under sides.
Mechanical engineer Jim M. Thompson was
fishing off Spanish Banks, Vancouver, in Janu-
ary 1984 when an 18- to 22-foot serpentine an-
imal surfaced about 100 feet away. It had a gi-
raffelike head with small stubby horns and
floppy ears.
In May 1992, music professor John Celona
saw a multihumped animal about 25 feet long
while sailing.
Students Damian Grant and Ryan Green
were swimming across Telegraph Bay in May
1994 when they saw a 20-foot animal with two
humps.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Northern sea lion ( Eumetopias
jubatus) can appear serpentine in the water
but only grows to about 10 feet 6 inches
long.
(2) The Northern elephant seal ( Mirounga
angustirostris) is found in British Columbian
waters in the nonbreeding season, but it
only measures up to 16 feet long and does
not have an elongat ed neck
(3) A surviving basilosaurid type of archaic
whale, suggest ed by Roy Mackal and Karl
Shuker. Some basilosaurids were serpentine,
grew up to 80 feet long, and lived in the
Late Eocene, about 42 million years ago.
They had a t ail fluke, but it ’s unknown
whether it was used primarily for propulsion
or steering. They are mainly known from
t he east er n Unit ed St at es and Egypt but
may have been worldwide in distribution.
(4) An evolved plesiosaur, suggested by
Edward Bousfield and Paul LeBlond. This
group of long-necked marine reptiles swam
wit h paddlelike limbs and had a body
lengt h t hat var ied fr om 6 t o 46 feet .
Plesiosaur fossils are found continuously
from the Middle Triassic, 238 million years
ago, to the Late Cretaceous, 65 million
years ago.
(5) A decaying Basking shark ( Cetorhinus
maximus) might account for the 1937
Naden Harbour carcass. These sharks take
o n a r ema r ka bly plesio sa ur -like a ppea r a nee
due t o t he differ ent ial decomposit ion r at es
oft heir gill slit sand lower t ail fluke. A 30-
foot carcass found in November 1934 by
Hugo Sandst rom on Henry Island t ur ned
out to be a Basking shark
(6) Some kind of decapod (crayfish or
lobster) has been suggested by Aaron Bauer
and Ant hony Russell as an explanat ion for
Hagelund’s juvenile Caddy capture in 1968.

Caitetu-Munde
Unknown peccary-like HOOFED Mammal of
South America.
Etymology: The Collared peccary is known as
the Caitetu in Brazil, possibly from a Tupi

Greek charadrai , “clefts,” where the bird is said
to live).
Physical description: Completely white
plumage. Yellow bill. Swanlike neck. Yellow
legs.
Behavior: Can detect human illness. Takes
the disease on itself, flies toward the sun, vom-
it s, and disper ses t he illness int o t he air . It s dung
is said to cure blindness.
Habitat: River s.
Distribution: Northern Europe or West Asia.
Possible explanations: Birds with prominent
white plumage have been proposed, among
them:
(1) The Ringed plover ( Charadrius
hiaticuld) is mostly white on the underside
with an orange bill. It is found primarily on
coast s and est uar ies.
(2) The Common crane ( Grus grus) is
gr ayish wit ha long neck. It br eeds in

a black bill. It winters in Southern Europe.
(5) The Lapwing ( Vanella vanella ) has a
short black bill and is only whit e on t he
underside, with green upper parts. It looks
black and white in flight or from a distance.
(6) The Woodcock ( Scolopas rustic old) is
widespread in the British Isles and much of
Europe. Its bill is grayish, and its plumage
looks more brown than white.
(7) The Whit e wagt ail {Motacill alba),
suggest ed by T. H. Whit e, has a gray back,
rump, and flanks.
(8) The Northern fulmar (Fulmaris glacialis)
is a light gray-and-whit e seabird with a
yellow bill. It spends a lot oft ime gliding

(9) A seagull of some type, especially the
Herring gull ( Larus argentatus) or Yellow-
legged gull ( L . cachinnans ), which have
yellow bills.

“t ui-t ui-t ui.” In Mayan lore, kills dying men on
t heir way t o t he cent er of t he ear t h.
Distribution: Southern Mexico to northern
Argent ina.
Possible explanations:
(1) Much Latin American bat -demon
myt ho logy can be t r aced t o t he Common
vampire bat ( Desmodus rotundas ), which
feeds ent ir ely on t he blood of ver t ebr at es —
especially cat t le and horses but so met imes
on humans. It silently approaches an
animal, lands on it , makes a t iny cut in t he
skin, and laps up the blood flow. It runs
and hops on all fours as well as flies.

(2) The False vampire bat ( Vampyrum
spectrum) has an elongat ed face and a small
noseleaf, unlike Desmodus. It is also much
larger, with a wingspan of 3 feet .
(3) Spear -nosed bats (Subfamily
Phyllost ominae) have large noseleaves and
are common throughout Central and South
Amer ica.
(4) Surviving GlANT WMPIRE Bat
(. Desmodus draculae ), a Pleist ocene bat
known from fossils in southeastern Brazil.

Camelops
A genus of large, North American, camel-like
HOOFED Mammais thought to have died out
10,000 years ago.
Physical description: Camel with a long neck,
long legs, and probably a single hump.
Distribution: Ut ah.
Significant sighting: In 1926, Hector Lee and
ot her high school st udent s on a field t r ip discov-
er ed an unfossilized Camelops skull in a cave near
Tabernacle Crater southwest of Fillmore, Utah.
A st r ip of dr ied ligament was st ill at t ached.
Possible explanations:
(1) Oliver Hay was of t he opinion t hat t he
skull was preserved except ionally well
because it had been covered by a 3- to 4-foot
layer of fine dust in t he cave. He t hought it
dat ed fr om t he Aft onian int er glacial per iod,
no later than 700,000 years ago.
(2) Alfred Romer was convinced that
Camelops per sist ed int o r ecent t imes. A
radiocarbon date of 11,075 years ago was
obtained from the skull in 1979, supporting
this theory.

Canadian Alligator
Large CROGODIUAN of western Canada.
Variant name: Pitt Lake Lizard.

feet, with a maximum of 20 feet. Relatively
smooth, dark skin. Horns or ears are sometimes
reported. Long snout . Jaws 12 inches long. Four

ally.
Tracks: Webbed.
Distribution: Pit t Lake, Root enay Lake, Chill-
iwack Lake, Cult us Lake, Nit inat Lake, and t he

CANADIAN ALLIGATOR 83
Significant sightings: On October 10, 1900,
George Goudereau saw an animal like a 12-foot
alligator crawl out of Crawford Bay on Koote-
nay Lake and root for food in a garbage heap.
Lat er , a t r ail of large, webbed t r acks was found.
In 1915, Charles Flood, Green Hicks, and
Donald Macrae found some black, alligator -like
lizards in a small mud lake south of Hope,
Br it ish Columbia .
Possible explanation: An unknown species of
cold-adapted crocodilian. The American alliga-
tor {Alligator mississippiensis) is the most
northerly American crocodilian and is found as
far north as the North Carolina coast.lt was re-
ported in southern Virginia in colonial times.
Crocodilians depend on their environment to
provide body warmth, and their hatchlings are
mor e suscept ible t o chilling t han adult s. In fact ,
eggs incubat ed at t emper at ur es lower t han 88°F
will tend to produce only female offspring and
ultimately threaten the viability of the popula-
tion. Nonetheless, both the American and the
Chinese alligators (A. sinensis) dig burrows into
which they can retreat during cold spells. They
can also survive in lakes that are frozen by keep-
ing their nostrils above the surface as their me-
tabolism and body temperature drop. In
warmer times, at least three species of crocodil-
ians lived in Canada: Leidyosuchus canadensis
and Stangero champs a in Alberta during the Late
Cretaceous, 65 million years ago, and Borealo-
suchus acutidentatus in Saskat chewan during the
Paleocene, 60 million years ago.

Cannibal Giant
Nor t h Amer ican Indian t r ibes oft en had legends
of Entities similar to Giant Hominids cr
WlIDM EN. Lar gely myt hical and par t ially hist or -
ical, t hese t ales in some cases may be based on a
traditional knowledge of BlGFOOT, Hairy
Bipeds, or North American Apes. Descriptions
vary, but most of these creatures are said to be
large and hairy; t hey live in r emot e areas and are
said to eat people. Some of their behaviors are
clearly fanciful, such as their ability t o cause un-
consciousness, their knack for trickery, or their
penchant for driving people crazy. Sometimes,
they are said to have stiff legs, a spike on their
toes, or no odor at all — attributes not matching
Bigfoot char act er ist ics very well. “St ick Indians”
generally refers to any group that lives in a
wilderness area (and thus could refer to other
tribes as well as unknown hominids) or that
t hr ows st icks at people. “St one giant s” wer e t he
ancient, stone-clad beings in Iroquoian mythol-

CANNIBAL GIANT 85
Captain Hanna’s FISH, an odd fish caught off New Harbor, Maine, in 1880 by Captain S. W. Hanna. (U.S. Fish
Commission)
Captain Hanna’s Fish
Odd, eellike FlSH of the North Atlantic Ocean.
Physical description: Serpentine. Length, 25
feet; 10 inches thick at the largest part. Darkish
slate color on top, grayish -white below. Flat head
that extends over a small mouth with sharp
teeth. Prominent gill slits. Two small, rayed pec-
toral fins and a triangular rayed dorsal fin behind
the head. A caudal fin extends around the tail.
Significant sighting: In August 1880, Capt. S.
W. Hanna caught a fish of this description off
New Harbor, Maine, but discarded it because it
had torn his net.
Distribution: Gulf of Maine.
Possible explanations:
(1) Unknown species of elongated shark,
perhaps a large form of the Frilled shark
( Chlamydoselachus anguineus ), suggested by
Bernard Heuvelmans. The Frilled shark
grows to over 6 feet in length and lives in
deep waters near the sea floor, primarily in
the eastern Atlantic, though three individuals
have been recorded in the western Atlantic.
It is the only shark to have a mouth that
opens at the tip of the snout. However,
sharks do not have rayed fins. Larger
varieties may exist. David Stead examined
the skull and vertebrae of a 12-foot fish that
washed up in the harbor at Sydney,
Australia, in August 1 907 and identified it as
a Frilled shark, though double the length of
the largest known specimens.
(2) Unknown species of bony fish,
suggested by Ben Roesch, based on its lack
of pelvic fins, and the position of the dorsal
fin.

Caribbean Crowing Snake
Unknown SNAKE of the West Indies.
Physical description: Length, 4 feet. Thick
body. Dull ochre color with dark spots. Pale red
pyramidal crest like a rooster. Scarlet wattles.
86 CAPTAIN HANNA’S FISH
Behavior: Crows like a rooster. Eats poultry.
Distribution: Eastern portion of Jamaica;
Haiti.
Significant sightings: In 1829, a medical doc-
tor saw a crested snake, dead and slightly de-
composed, in Jamaica.
A snake with wattles was shot in Jamaica on
March 30, 1850, by the son of Jasper Cargill.
Possible explanation: Vocalizing snakes are not
unknown. 5^ C ROWING CRESTED COBRA.

Caribbean Monk Seal
Nondescript SEAL of the West Indies, presumed
extinct since 1952.
Scientific name: Monachus tropicalis, given by
Gray in 1850.
Physical description: Length, 7-8 feet. Brown
on the back with a gray tinge.
Behavior: Approachable and unaggressive.
Distribution: Caribbean Sea, off Haiti and Ja-
maica. It formerly extended throughout the
northern and western Caribbean and the Gulf
of Mexico.
Significant sightings: Sixteen out of ninety-
three Haitian and Jamaican fishermen inter-
viewed in 1997 claimed to have seen at least one
monk seal in the previous two years.
Present status: Five major surveys of former
monk seal habitats have been conducted by
trained naturalists since 1950, with no definite
evidence of the animal’s survival past 1952.
Possible explanations:
(1) A misidentified California sea lion
(. Zalophus calif ornianus) that escaped from
captivity.
(2) The Hooded seal ( Cystophora cristata)
occasionally strays as far south as Florida.
(3) The Harbor seal ( Phoca vitulina :) and
Harp seal ( Phoca groenlandicd) are even rarer
visitants to the Caribbean.

Carolina Parakeet
Small Bird of the Parrot family (Psittacidae) in
the southeastern United States, presumed ex-
tinct since 1918.
Scientific name: Conuropsis carolinensis, given
by Tommaso Salvadori in 1891.
Physical description: Bright green plumage.
Yellow head. Orange forehead and cheeks.
Habitat: Wetlands.
Distribution: Santee River, South Carolina;
Okefenokee Swamp, Georgia; Okeechobee
County, Florida.
Significant sightings : Henry Redding reported
a flock of thirty parakeets near Fort Drum
Creek, Florida, in 1920.
In 1926, Charles E. Doe saw three pairs of
parakeets at Grapevine Hammock in Okee-
chobee County, Florida. He took some of their
eggs, which have been preserved.
The National Audubon Society bird wardens
for the Santee Swamp area in South Carolina re-
ported the presence of green parakeets with yel-
low heads on several occasions in the 1930s. In
1933 and 1934, George M. Melamphy saw as

CAROLINA PARAKEET 87
many as nine together at a time, feeding on sun-
flower seeds. Ornithologist Alexander Sprunt Jr.
claimed to have seen a juvenile fly swiftly by in
the fall of 1936. Sprunt’s companion, Robert
Porter Allen, had come to believe by 1949 that
they had seen mourning doves or released exotic
parrots.
Orsen Stemville took a color film of some
type of parakeet in the Okefenokee Swamp,
Georgia, in 1937.
In 1938, a woodsman named Shokes saw two
yellow-headed parakeets circling above him as a
juvenile flew up to join them near Wadmacaun
Creek, South Carolina. The Santee habitat was
destroyed during the completion of the Santee-
Cooper Hydroelectric Project in 1936-38.
Present status : The last wild specimens were
shot in April 1904 at Lake Okeechobee, Florida.
The last captive specimen died at the Cincinnati
Zoo in February 1918.
Possible explanation: Nonnative green para-
keets escaped from pet owners or zoos.

Carugua
Unknown PRIMATE of South America.
Behavior: Kills cattle by pulling their tongues
out.
Distribution: Ybytymi area, Paraguay.
Significant sighting: In the 1940s, in nearly
eight months, about 100 cattle were found dead
in the Ybytymi area with no wounds except for
their tongues being torn out. The events re-
curred in 1952 or 1953 on a different ranch.

Caspian Tiger
Big C AT of West Asia, presumed extinct since
the 1970s.
Scientific name: Panthera tigris virgata.
Variant name: Hyrcanian tiger.
Distribution: Talysh, Azerbaijan; the Cudi
Mountains of Turkey and Iran.
Significant sightings: The Caspian subspecies
of tiger formerly had a vast range from
Afghanistan, Turkestan, and Kazakhstan
through the Caucasus to Iran and Turkey. The
last time a living specimen was seen was in
Afghanistan in 1967. A fresh skin had been pur-
chased by a druggist in eastern Turkey some-
time in the 1970s, but it has not been properly
examined and may have been an illegally ob-
tained Bengal pelt. However, hunters in Azer-
baijan and Turkey still report hearing and see-
ing it.

Cassie
A Multihumped Sea Monster of the North
Atlantic Ocean.
Etymology: After Casco Bay, in imitation of
other named water monsters. Coined in 1986
by Loren Coleman.
Distribution: Casco Bay and other points
along the coast of the Gulf of Maine, including
Penobscot and Portland.
Significant sightings: Future naval commodore
Edward Preble was serving as an ensign on the
warship Protector in June 1779 when he saw a
large serpent lying on the surface of a bay along
the Maine coast. Commander John Foster
Williams ordered Preble to launch a longboat in
an attempt to shoot the animal, which appeared
to be 100-150 feet long and as thick as a barrel.
As the boat approached, the serpent raised its
head 10 feet above the water. A shot was fired,
but the snake swam away quickly.
On July 12, 1818, a sea monster was seen in
the harbor of Portland, Maine, in full view of a
number of observers at Weeks’s wharf.
In the summer of 1836, Captain Black of the
88 CARUGUA
schooner Fox spotted an animal in the inlet be-
tween the mainland and Mount Desert Rock,
Maine. It held its snakelike head 2-3 feet above
the water.
Maj. Gen. H. C. Merriam was sailing with
his sons opposite Wood Island Light, Maine, on
August 5, 1905, when they saw a mottled
brown “monster serpent” with its head 4 feet
above the water slowly moving toward their be-
calmed boat. The animal then circled them
from a distance of 300 yards at about 12 miles
an hour. Its head was like a snake’s, the neck was
15-18 inches in diameter, and the total length
was 60 feet or more. It remained visible for ten
minutes, then reappeared a short time later after
the wind started up.
On August 20, 1910, the fishing steamer
Bonita passed an 80-foot animal in Casco Bay.
It was black with large white spots.
Present status: Few sightings since the 1950s.

Cat-Headed Snake
Mystery SNAKE of Central Europe.
Physical description: Length, 7 feet. Gray and
black color. Head like a cat’s. Ridged back.
Distribution: The Swiss Alps.

Thomas Tinner killed a large snake with a cat-
like head at Hauwelen on the Frumsemberg
mountain, Switzerland.

Catoblepas
Mammal of North Africa; see SEMIMYTHICAL
Beasts.
Etymology: Greek, “that which looks
downward.”
Variant names: Catoplepe, Gorgon.
Physical description: Body like a bull’s. Over-
sized head so heavy that it always hangs close to
the ground. Bristled, scraggly head-hair from
crown to nose. Scaly back. Small wings, accord-
ing to later sources.
Behavior: Sluggish. Has an overpowering
breath (odor). Its gaze can kill (though Pliny
may have gotten this characteristic mixed up
with that of the Basiusk).
Distribution: The Nile River in Egypt, east to
Ethiopia.
Possible explanation: The Black wildebeest or
White-tailed gnu ( Connochaetes gnoii) is a
stocky, dark-brown antelope with front-facing
horns and a strange tuft of long hair on the
muzzle that acts as a scent dispenser for its face
glands. It is found in South Africa. Its fighting
posture is to kneel on the ground and hook its
opponent from below with its sharply angled
horns. The related Blue wildebeest or Brindled
gnu (C. taurinuL), of South and East Africa,
ranged much father north, where Pliny was
more likely to have heard about it, possibly per-
sisting on the North African coast into histori-
cal times.

CATS (Unknown)
The Cat family (Felidae) arose from primitive
carnivores in Europe about 30 million years ago,
in the Oligocene. Common characteristics in-
clude extraordinarily acute hearing, eyesight
adapted for night vision, a sensitive nose,
whiskers, long canine teeth for seizing, large car-
nassial teeth for tearing, a spotted or striped
coat, flexible vertebrae, and retractile claws (ex-
cept for the cheetah).
The largest living cat is the male Tiger [Pan-
ther a tigris) , which in Siberia attains an average
length of 10 feet 4 inches from nose to tail tip.
CATS 89
Claims of tigers up to 13 feet or longer are
sometimes based on stretched skins or faulty
measurements. Weights up to 700 pounds have
been reported.
Felid taxonomy remains somewhat contro-
versial. Some authorities put modern cats into
three groups: the Subfamily Pantherinae, incor-
porating leopards, jaguars, lions, tigers, lynxes,
and bobcats; the Subfamily Felinae, which in-
cludes everything in the genus Felis; and an un-
determined category for the cheetah. Others
place all living cats into the Subfamily Felinae.
Genetic variations in coat coloration have
been one reason why cat classification has been
problematic. The general purpose for spots,
stripes, and splotches on the coat is to provide
camouflage and make it more difficult for the
animal to be identified when it is stalking its
prey. Each species has a basic set of markings,
and individual cats often sport a unique pattern.
Significant variations in coat pigmentation (al-
bino, melanistic, chinchilla, agouti, and so on)
are produced by the mutant alleles of six major
genes. If enough variants occur in an isolated
population to allow it to interbreed successfully
and preserve those characteristics, it becomes a
subspecies.
The occurrence of melanism (black pigment)
in some mystery cats is perplexing. Melanism is
the commonest coat variation in wild cats and
occurs in thirteen different species. Black leop-
ards are most often found in the forested part of
their range in tropical Asia and less often in
Africa. At one time, they were considered a dis-
tinct species, but both normal and melanistic
individuals can be found in the same litter. The
American puma exhibits very little tendency to-
ward melanism, making reports of black EAST
EEN PUMAS especially anomalous.
Of the sixty- two mystery cats in this list, sev-
enteen probably represent little-known color
morphs of known species, such as the BlUE
TGER and the KING CHEETAH. Hybridization
between various cat species in the wild is rare
but possible under certain circumstances in
areas where two species overlap. Eight cat cryp-
tids may represent recurring hybrids, such as the
Kellas CAT and the TNICUM Cat. Ten others,
such as the BORNEAN TGERand the ARIZONA
Jaguar, are unverified extensions of the distri-
bution of known species.
Twelve cats in the list may be undescribed
species new to science; these include the SPOT
ted Lion and the Nayarit Ruffed Cat. Five
may represent surviving species known from
fossils, especially the saber-toothed cats
Mach air odus and Smilodon (among them the
Tgee de Montagne, WoerLion, and Wvter
Tger). Four versions of ALIEN Big CATS are in-
cluded; their origins are undoubtedly multi-
causal, but some have been tempted to think a
new species is involved.
Four on the list do not seem to be cats at all,
while the WINGED Cat is apparently an extreme
form of a disease afflicting domestic cats.

Mystery C AT of West Asia.
Scientific name: Felis daemon , given by K. A.
Satunin in 1904.
Physical description: Length, 22-30 inches.
Black with a reddish tinge to reddish-brown.
Thin scattering of white hairs all over. Lighter
below. Black stripes on the flanks. Tail, 13-15
inches long.
Distribution: Armenia and Azerbaijan, south
of the Caucasus Mountains.
Significant sighting: Described by K. A. Sat-
unin on the basis of two mounted specimens,
skins, and skulls in the Leningrad Academy of
Sciences.

Possible explanations:
(1) Melanistic morph of the Caucasian
wildcat ( Felis silvestris caucasicd).
(2) Leral Domestic cat ( Felis silvestris catus ) ,
according to S. I. Ognev and Reginald
Pocock.
(3) Leral cat x Caucasian wildcat hybrid,
suggested by Karl Shuker. Possibly similar
to the K ELLAS Cat of Scotland.

wise and friendly and included Chiron and
Photius, the companions of heroes.
Distribution: Coastal mountains of Thessaly,
Greece, between Mount Ossa and Mount Pil-
ion; possibly Arabia and elsewhere.
Significant sightings: Pliny claims to have seen
a dead Centaur, preserved in honey, taken to
Rome from Arabia via Egypt during the reign of
Emperor Claudius (a.d. 41-54). Phlegon of
Tralles saw it about sixty years later and wrote
that it had a fierce face and hairy arms and fin-
gers. Its human torso merged smoothly with its
horse’s body, and its hooves were firm. The en-
tire body had turned dark brown.
John Farrell and Margaret Johnson were driv-
ing along a country road near Drogheda,
County Louth, Ireland, in the spring of 1966
when their way was blocked for two minutes by
a horse with a man’s face.
Possible explanations:
(1) Early depictions show Centaurs as hairy
giants. They are considered to be the
personification of a wild mountain tribe of
horsemen who herded cattle. The
Thessalians were noted for their riding
ability.
(2) Hobby-horse dancers in ancient Greek
rituals, suggested by Robert Graves.
(3) Pliny’s Centaur may have been a
manufactured composite assembled from
mummified human and pony parts.

CEPHALOPODS (Unknown)
Squids, octopuses, cuttlefish, the fossil am-
monites, and the chambered nautilus are all
members of the Class Cephalopoda, marine In-
VERTEB RATES with large eyes, a head surrounded
by muscular tentacles, and a chitinous beak like
a parrot’s. They are considered the most highly
evolved invertebrates. Octopuses have eight ten-
tacles, squids and cuttlefish have ten, and the
nautilus has sixty to ninety. All move by taking
in water and expelling it forcibly through a
siphon; octopuses can also crawl along the ocean
bottom.
The first cephalopods were the nautiloids,
which appeared in the Ordovician, some 450
million years ago. The ammonites became
abundant from the Devonian to the Cretaceous,
350-65 million years ago. Cuttlefish, squids,
and octopuses have only vestigial internal shells
or no shells at all; consequently, they have left
virtually no fossils behind. Their closest fossil
relatives were the belemnites, common in Meso-
zoic seas, that had conical shells and eight tenta-
cles equipped with hooks.
The largest living invertebrate is the Giant
squid {Architeuthis sp.). Although the top size
for this animal is a matter of some controversy
(see Kraken), the 2.2-ton specimen that
washed ashore at Thimble Tickle, Newfound-
land, on November 2, 1878, measured 20 feet
from beak to tail, and one of its tentacles meas-
ured 35 feet, giving it a total length of 55 feet.
It also had the largest eye of any known animal,
living or extinct, with a diameter of about 15.75
inches. The largest known octopus is the Giant
Pacific octopus ( Enteroctopus dofleini ), which
can exceed a radial spread of 20 feet.
There are ten cephalopod cryptids in this list,
three squids and seven octopuses. Two of the
octopuses have supposedly been found in fresh-
water environments, and one of the squids was
reported living in a toxic oil-emulsion pit. Ei-
ther habitat would be a first for any of the
cephalopods, which are exclusively marine. Six
in the list involve animals of considerable size.

CETACEANS (Unknown)
Whales, dolphins, and porpoises belong to the
Order Cetacea, a group of mammals that have
completely adopted an aquatic existence. They
have streamlined, hairless bodies with two front
flippers, no hind legs, a muscular tail for propul-
sion, and a blowhole at the top of the head for
breathing. There are two main types: The
Toothed whales (Odontocetes) include dol-
phins, porpoises, sperm whales, the beluga, the
narwhal, and beaked whales; the toothless
Baleen whales (Mysticetes) include the rorquals,
right whales, and the gray whale.
Recent molecular studies have shown that
whales are most closely related to modern cattle,
deer, and pigs (HOOFED Mam M AIS of the Order
Artiodactyla) and may have evolved from them
in the Early Eocene, about 52 million years ago.
Alternatively, they may have emerged from the
mesonychids, an extinct group of archaic ungu-
lates that ranged in size from a weasel to a bear.
The earliest cetacean fossils are the freshwater
pakicetids, known mostly from teeth and skulls
found on the Indian subcontinent. The ambu-
locetids are the oldest marine whales, found in
Pakistan in the Eocene, 50-45 million years
ago. They had four large legs used for swim-
ming, looked more like crocodiles than whales,
and lived offshore, although they apparently
swam into river estuaries to drink fresh water.
Next came the protocetids, which lived in fully
marine tropical and subtropical environments
around the world during the Middle and Late
Eocene, 48—42 million years ago.
Most important to cryptozoology are the
basilosaurids, the last of the archaic whales.
These emerged in the Late Eocene, about 42
million years ago, and are characterized by long,
flexible vertebrae; reduced but functional hind
limbs; a muscular, fluked tail; and a serpentine
body that grew up to 80 feet long. Basilosaurid
fossils are found in Louisiana, Alabama, Missis-
sippi, and Egypt. The type fossil, Basilosaurus ce-
toides y was misidentified as a reptile in 1843
when it was first described; the genus name
means “king reptile.” The nineteenth-century
anatomist Richard Owen later renamed it Zeu-
glodon (“yoked tooth”), and it is often cited as
such in some cryptozoological literature. How-
ever, the rules of nomenclature defer to the ear-
lier name even if it’s inaccurate. Because it looks
remarkably like some Sea MONSTERS reported
in modern times, a surviving basilosaurid is fre-
quently suggested as a candidate.
Baleen whales first turned up in the Late
Eocene, 40 million years ago, while toothed
whales emerged in the Early Oligocene, 35 mil-
lion years ago. Although the toothed whales
were originally marine, some have returned to
freshwater.
The largest mammal ever recorded is the Blue
whale ( Balaenoptera musculus). A female mea-
suring 110 feet 2.5 inches was brought into the
Cia Argentina de Pesca shore station in
Grytviken, South Georgia, in 1909.
Of the 17 cetaceans in this section, all but 2
are toothed whales, and of these, 9 are probable
dolphins. The 2 lone baleen cryptids are the
Magenta Whale and the Scrag Whale.
Their geographic breakdown is: Antarctic 3, At-
lantic Ocean 4, Indian Ocean 2, Mediterranean
1, Pacific Ocean 6, and South America 1.

Challenger Deep Flatfish
A flat abyssal FlSH of the North Pacific Ocean.
Etymology: Named after the Challenger Deep
in the Mariana Trench.
Physical description: Solelike. Two distinct
eyes.
Habitat: Visits or inhabits abyssal oceanic
depths where no light penetrates.
Distribution: The Mariana Trench, east of
Guam.
Significant sighting: On January 23, 1960, the
bathyscaph Trieste , piloted by Jacques Piccard
and Donald Walsh, reached a record depth of
35,800 feet (7 miles) in the Challenger Deep. As
they touched down on the bottom, a flatfish
with two distinct eyes swam away to avoid
them.
Possible explanation: Torben Wolff suggested
the animal was a Sea cucumber, perhaps the
cushion-shaped Galatheathauria aspera, which
has an oval shape. Eyes would be of absolutely
no use at this depth.

Champ
pRESHWVTER MONSTER of Lake Champlain in
Vermont, New York, and Quebec.
Scientific name: Champtanystropheus y pro-
posed by Dennis Hall.
Etymology: After the lake.
Variant names: Champy, CHAOUSAROU,
Sammy, Tatoskok (Abenaki/Algonquian)
Physical description: Reports from the nine-
teenth century to the 1960s generally describe
an enormous serpent. Fiery eyes. Possibly
hooded. Glistening scales. Fishlike tail. Spouts
water.
Reports from the 1960s onward are more like
those of the classic Loch Ness-like freshwater
LONGNECK. Length, 15-50 feet. Dark brown or
black color. Rough skin. Height out of the
water, 3-8 feet. Horse- or snakelike head with
two horns or ears. Visible teeth. Long, upright
neck, 12 inches thick and 4-5 feet long. Maned.
One to ten humps reported, with two or three
most frequently observed.
Behavior (post- 1960 observations): Most fre-
quently seen in the summer between 7:00 and
8:00 PM. in clear weather with a calm surface.
Elusive. Moves by vertical undulations. Leaves a
well-defined wake. Aggressive and noisy, though
the noise from motors seems to frighten it.
Probably feeds on fishes.
Distribution: Sightings have been scattered
throughout the length of Lake Champlain.
Clusters of sightings seem to occur at Rouses
Point, Plattsburgh, and Bulwagga Bay near Port
Henry in New York, as well as off Burlington in
Vermont.
Significant sightings: The earliest sighting may
be a dubious report from July 1819 of a 187-
foot monster witnessed by Captain Crum from
his scow in Bulwagga Bay, New York.
In early July 1873, a crew laying track for the
New York & Canada Railroad along the shore
near Dresden, New York, saw a serpent with an
enormous head approaching them from across
the lake. The men started to retreat but saw the
animal turn and swim rapidly away. It seemed
to be covered with bright, silvery scales, and it
spurted water about 20 feet into the air. Its tail
resembled that of a fish. A few days afterward,
others saw the animal and farmers complained
of missing livestock. On August 9, a party of
monster hunters organized by the Whitehall
Times allegedly trapped the serpent in Axehelve
Bay and shot it from the decks of a steamboat
they had commandeered, the Molyneaux. On
September 7, railway workers eager for the
$50,000 reward that P. T. Barnum had recently
offered thought they had found the missing car-
cass, but it turned out to be a log.
On July 30, 1883, Sheriff Nathan H.
Mooney saw a huge serpent 25-35 feet long
with a flat, triangular head in Cumberland Bay,
New York. It stood out about 5 feet above the
CHAMP 95

water. Sightings continued throughout the sum-
mer.
In 1945, Charles Langlois and his wife, of
Rutland, Vermont, got close to the animal in a
rowboat.
Orville Wells watched a 20-foot animal with
a long neck and two humps in Treadwell Bay,
New York, in 1976.
On July 5, 1977, Sandra Mansi and her fam-
ily were picnicking by the lake when they saw
the head and neck of a “dinosaur” some
100-160 feet offshore near St. Albans, Ver-
mont. She managed to take a color Instamatic
photograph of the animal before leaving hur-
riedly in the car. The photo has held up under
scrutiny and apparently shows a gray-black ob-
ject at least 15-20 feet long at the waterline. It
has a long neck, a small head, and a hump. B.
Roy Frieden of the University of Arizona’s Op-
tical Sciences Center in 1981 determined that
the photo was not a montage and appeared to
show a separate set of surface waves coming
from the object that are independent from the
waves from the rest of the lake. A 1982 analysis
of wave patterns in the photo by oceanographer
Paul H. LeBlond gave an estimate ranging from
16 to 56 feet for the waterline length of the ob-
ject.
Jim Kennard and Joseph Zarzynski picked up
a target using towed side-scan sonar on June 3,
1979, in Whallon Bay, New York. The object
was moving at a depth of 175 feet. However, a
school of fishes was not ruled out.
On July 28, 1984, Michael Shea, Bette Mor-
ris, and about sixty other people watched
Champ for ten to fifteen minutes from the ves-
sel The Spirit of Ethan Allen off Appletree Point,
Burlington, Vermont. It was approximately 30
feet long and had three to five humps.
On August 10, 1988, Martin Klein, Joseph
Zarzynski, and others aboard an air-sea rescue
vessel between Westport, New York, and Basin
Harbor, Vermont, saw an animate object
thrashing on the surface of the lake.

On July 6, 2000, Dennis Jay Hall obtained
about forty- five minutes of digital video of two
long-necked animals in shallow water just south
of the mouth of Otter Creek, Vermont. He has
several videos of single animals taken on several
other occasions, one as recently as October 6,
2000, in Button Bay, Vermont.
Possible explanations:
(1) Newspaper hoaxes, especially in the
nineteenth century.
(2) Wave effects created by passing
watercraft.
(3) Floating logs.
(4) The Lake sturgeon ( Acipenser fulvescens)
is still found in Lake Champlain. This fish
can grow to 7-9 feet in length, though most
are a bit smaller. The lake supported a small
commercial fishery that harvested 50-200
sturgeons annually in the late nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries. The annual
harvest declined rapidly in the late 1 940s,
and the fishery finally closed in 1967. In
1998, the Vermont Department of Fish and
Wildlife began a project to assess and
ultimately restore a viable lake sturgeon
population in Lake Champlain.
(5) A stray Harbor seal ( Phoca vitulina ),
known to colonize small lakes and rivers in
northern Canada, may account for some
early sightings. In February 1810, a 4-foot
seal was found crawling on the ice of Lake
Champlain south of Burlington. Two other
specimens were found in 1846 and 1876.
(6) An evolved plesiosaur has been theorized
by J. Richard Greenwell and Karl Shuker.
Long-necked plesiosaurs such as
Elasmosaurus had a large body, short tail,
four limbs modified into paddles, a long
neck with a small head, and a maximum
known length of 46 feet. Their primary
food was probably fishes. Plesiosaur fossils
are found continuously from the Middle
Triassic (238 million years ago) to the end
of the Cretaceous (65 million years ago),
though there was a smaller extinction at the
end of the Jurassic (144 million years ago)
that resulted in a reduction in diversity.
Fossils have been found in abundance in
marine sediments in England and Kansas,
but all continents including Antarctica have
yielded some remains. They were exclusively
marine; consequently, a variety that could
subsist in a freshwater environment would
have had to undergo significant
modifications.
(7) A surviving archaic basilosaurid whale
has been suggested by Roy Mackal and Gary
Mangiacopra. These predecessors of modern
cetaceans lived in the Late Eocene, about 42
million years ago, and had serpentine bodies
that grew up to 80 feet long.
(8) Tanystropheus longobardicus, a diapsid
reptile from the Middle Triassic, 230
million years ago, has been suggested by
Dennis Jay Hall, although it has a much
longer neck and smaller body than Champ
appears to have. Young specimens have
relatively short necks, which apparently grew
quickly as the animal reached adulthood. Its
long neck was more than twice the length of
its body and tail, and it apparently attained
a total length of 10 feet. Found in marine
sediments in Central Europe, Tanystropheus
may have been a coastal swimmer that fed
on fishes. In the 1970s, Hall discovered a
12-inch reptile with a forked tongue in a
marshy area bordering Lake Champlain. It
was sent to the University of Vermont,
where it was subsequently lost. He later ran
across a drawing of Tanystropheus and
thought it was very similar. A smaller
relative from the Late Triassic,
Tanytrachelos, has been found in Virginia.

is olive-gray above and white below, with
scutes along the back and the sides.

Chemisit
Unknown animal of East Africa that the British
call the Nandi Bear
Etymology: Kalenjin (Nilo-Saharan) word
meaning “devil”; however, at one level of mean-
ing, it is regarded as an animal, not a spirit.
Variant names: Chemoiset, Chemosit,
Chimisit, Gononet.
Physical description: Tawny or reddish color.
Sometimes striped. Face like an ape’s.
Behavior: Nocturnal. Stands on its hind legs
sometimes. Makes a peculiar moaning cry or
blood-curdling roar. Said to break into native
huts at night, kill the occupants, and eat their
brains. Used as a threat by mothers to make
their children obey.
Tracks: Round and bearlike.
Distribution: Western Kenya.
Significant sighting: In the 1960s, engineer
Angus McDonald was sleeping in a hut near
Kipkabus, Kenya, when he was awakened by a
shriek as a large animal jumped in the window
and chased him around the hut for about five
minutes. It seemed to be about 7 feet tall with
an ape’s face, and it was able to run on both two
feet and all fours, leaving round tracks. The El-
geyo tribesmen identified it as a Chemosit.

Chessie
Sea MONSTER that frequents the Chesapeake
Bay, Maryland.
Etymology: After the bay. First named in July
1977 by a reporter for the Richmond (Va.)
T i mes-Dispatch.
Variant names: Chesapeake Chessie, Potomac
Patty.
Physical description: Serpentine or eel-like in
general shape. Length, 12-35 feet. Smooth. Di-
ameter, 8-10 inches. Dark gray to black. Three
or four humps. Turtlelike head and neck held 3
feet above the surface. No fins.
Behavior: Sometimes reported swimming
with horizontal undulations; at other times, it is
seen swimming with vertical undulations, while
the head and neck are kept steady. Passive to-
ward observers.
Tracks: Described as reptilian or snakelike.
Distribution: Chesapeake Bay, Potomac
River, and Rappahannock River in Maryland
and Virginia. Favored spots are Love Point on
Kent Island, Eastern Bay, and the mouth of the
Potomac River.
Significant sightings: An animal suspiciously
like a large turtle, 12 feet long with a large shell
and four fins, was seen by the crews of two
schooners on July 26, 1840, near North Point,
Maryland.
An engineer performing helicopter test flights
out of Aberdeen Proving Grounds saw an enor-
mous, eel-like animal in the Bush River in 1963.
In 1965, Pam Peters saw a serpentine animal
in the South River off Hillsmere Shores, Mary-
land.
In July 1977, Gregg Hupka took a fuzzy pho-
tograph of an animal at the mouth of the Po-
tomac River.
CHESSIE 99
G. F. Green III and his family saw a 25-foot,
humped animal while they were water-skiing on
June 22, 1980. It sank when they approached it.
On May 21, 1982, Robert and Karen Frew
videotaped a 30- to 35-foot sea monster, slightly
under 1 foot in diameter, off Love Point, Mary-
land. They observed the animal from about 200
feet away as it repeatedly broke the surface of
the water and moved against the current at
about 4-5 knots. George Zug, Clyde Roper,
and five other scientists from the Smithsonian
Institution could not identify the object during
a special meeting on August 20 to evaluate the
tape, calling it “animate but unidentifiable.”
Clyde Taylor and his daughter Carol were
walking along Cloverdale Community Beach on
Kent Island, Maryland, on July 16, 1982, when
they saw a 30-foot serpentine animal in 3 feet of
water moving in vertical undulations toward the
shore. Carol ran toward it, and it dove out of
sight. Clyde, a commercial artist, drew a series
of pictures of it.
Possible explanations:
(1) Floating logs.
(2) The Harbor porpoise ( Phocoena
phocoend) only grows to slightly more than
6 feet in length.
(3) Sea turtles may be responsible for some
sightings, especially the 9-foot Atlantic
loggerhead ( Caretta caretta) , the 4-foot
Green turtle ( Chelonia my das), and the 8-
foot Leatherback turtle ( Dermochelys
coriacea :), all of which have been found in
the Chesapeake Bay.
(4) The American eel ( Anguilla rostrata)
only grows to about 5 feet. It has a slender,
snakelike body but does not hold its head
and neck above the surface.
(5) The Northern water snake ( Nerodia
sipedon sipedon ) has dark dorsal crossbands
and reaches a length of 4 feet 6 inches.
(6) A surviving archaic basilosaurid whale
has been suggested by Roy Mackal for
similar SEA MONSTERS.
(7) An out-of-place Anaconda ( Eunectes
murinus) was suggested by John Meriner,
though these are tropical freshwater snakes.
(8) Moray eels (Family Muraenidae) and
Sea snakes (Family Hydrophiidae) are
similarly tropical or subtropical. Morays
rarely swim on the surface.
(9) The name Chessie has recently been
appropriated by a Florida manatee
( Trichechus manatus latirostris) captured in
the Chesapeake Bay in the fall of 1994 and
returned to Florida. Subsequently
monitored by the U.S. National Biological
Service, Chessie was tracked migrating all
the way north to Rhode Island in 1995.
This or another manatee might have been
responsible for earlier sightings.

Cheval Marin
Sea MONSTER of the coastal waters of Canada
and West Africa.
Etymology: French, “sea horse.”
Physical description: Horselike head. Clawed
forearms. Fishlike, scaly tail.
Behavior: Neighs like a horse.
Distribution: lie Brion and Riviere-St.-Jean,
Quebec, Canada; West Africa.
Possible explanations:
(1) Explorer Jacques Cartier saw two
Walruses ( Odobenus rosmarus) on the lie
Brion in 1534 and fish-shaped, horselike
animals in a river that may have been the
modern Riviere-St.-Jean off the St.
Lawrence. The French naturalist Louis
Nicolas conflated the two stories and mixed
in Native American legends of the Horse’s
100 CHEVAL MARIN
Head to describe a composite animal.
(2) Early reports from French Africa may
have confused the Hippopotamus
( Hippopotamus amphibius) and the West
African manatee (Trichechus senegalensis).

Colin F. Taylor, ed., Native American Myths
and Legends (New York: Smithmark, 1994),

Chimera
Composite monster of West Asia; see SEMI-
mythical Beasts.
Etymology: From the Greek chimaira (“mon-
ster”). Originally a “she-goat,” the feminine
form of chimaros , “he-goat one winter old.”
Variant names: Chimaera, Khimaira.
Physical description: An assemblage of
anatomical parts borrowed from totally unre-
lated animals. Head of a lion. Body of a goat.
Serpentine tail. According to Hesiod, an animal
with three heads (goat, lion, snake).
Behavior: Said to breathe fire. Lustful.
Distribution: Mount Olimpos (Tahtali or Ya-
nartas), Olimpos-Bey Mountains National
Park, Antalya Province, south-central Turkey.
Significant sighting: Wreaked havoc in an-
cient Lycia. Killed by the Greek hero
Bellerophon, mounted on the winged horse Pe-
gasus. This may have provided some inspira-
tion for the legend of St. George slaying a
Dragon (British).
Possible explanations:
(1) A fantastic product of the imagination.
(2) Based on a volcanic crevice on Mount
Olimpos that still vents flammable methane
gas and burns both day and night.
(3) Lions are said to have lived at the top of
the Mount Olimpos, goats were pastured in
the midheights, and snakes lived at the
bottom.
(4) A personification of a storm cloud.

human with either a doglike head or a head that
sags below the shoulders. Eyes in shoulders.
Mouth in chest. Long hair down the shoulders.
Behavior: Uses bow and arrows.
Distribution: Rio Orinoco delta, Venezuela.
CHIPAREMAI 101
Present status: Sometimes erroneously cited in
support of Mono Grande reports.
Possible explanations:
(1) The West Indian manatee ( Trichechus
manatus) looks superficially human and has
sparse facial hair.
(2) An Indian tribe that wears elaborate
head coverings that make them look
headless and uses body art in the form of a
face to decorate the torso, as suggested by
Victor Von Hagen.
(3) A deformed Indian, possibly a
hunchback.

Chipekwe
Dinosaur-like animal of Central Africa, similar
to the Em eia-Ntojka
Etymology: Bemba (Bantu), “monster.”
Around Lake Tanganyika, Chipekwe is a com-
mon name for the Giant tigerfish ( Hydrocynus
goliath ), a 4-foot fish that can grow to 150
pounds. The word may actually refer to any dan-
gerous animal, from venomous snakes to man-
eating crocodiles, in several Bantu languages.
Variant names: Chepekwe, Chimpekwe,
Mbilintu (“frightful unknown monster”),
Mfuku.
Physical description: Smooth, dark body. Size
ranges from smaller than a hippo to as large as
an elephant. Has a single smooth, white, ivory
horn or tusk.
Behavior: Nocturnal. Amphibious. Aggressive.
Kills and eats hippopotamuses and rhinoceroses.
Tracks: Like hippopotamus or crocodile
tracks but 2 feet 6 inches-3 feet long.
Habitat: Swamps, lakes.
Distribution: Lake Bangweulu, Kafue Flats,
Luapula River, Lukulu River, Lake Mweru, and
Lake Shiwa Ngandu in Zambia; Dililo Swamps
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; Lake
Tanganyika in Tanzania; Lago Dilolo and the
Kasai River in Angola.
Significant sightings: Joseph Menges and Hans
Schomburgk independently reported the exis-
tence of an unknown animal — half elephant,
half dragon — in Zambian swamps at the end of
the nineteenth century. Schomburgk noted the
absence of hippos in parts of Lake Bangweulu as
the direct result of an unknown amphibious
predator.
The Aushi people have a tradition of the
death of a Chipekwe, which they killed with
their harpoons in the deep waters of the Luapula
River, Zambia. It had a smooth, dark body, and
a single ivory horn on its snout.
Native Commissioner Robert Young shot at a
large animal in Lake Shiwa Ngandu, Zambia,
that dived and left a wake like a steamboat.
Retired magistrate H. Croad was camped by
a small lake in Zambia when he heard a splash-
ing noise in the middle of the night. The next
morning, he found large footprints of an animal
that he could not recognize.
Around 1906, settler R. M. Green was told
by natives that a hippo had its throat torn out by
a Chipekwe on the Lukulu River, Zambia.
In October 1919, a Belgian railway manager
named Lepage was charged by a dinosaur-like
monster with “tusks like horns,” a pointed snout,
and a scaly hump. It is said to have later stam-
peded through the village of Fungurume,
Katanga Region, Democratic Republic of the
Congo. The story was followed by another report
by a Belgian big-game hunter named Gapelle
who is said to have tracked a similar beast for 12
miles in the Congo and finally sighted it. It had
a kangaroo-like tail and a horn on its snout. An
expedition by the Smithsonian Institution was
allegedly in search of the beast when three mem-
bers of the party were killed in a railway accident.
However, Wentworth Gray exposed these stories
as hoaxes in 1920, pointing out that Gapelle was
102 CHIPEKWE
an anagram for Lepage and that the Smithsonian
(though the accident had occurred on November
28) was not hunting dinosaurs.
In 1932, Franz W. Grobler reported he had
seen a photo of a Chipekwe standing on the
back of a hippo that it had killed in Lago Dilolo,
Angola. However, the photo was a crude hoax
by someone who superimposed a Komodo
dragon onto the photo of a dead hippo. It was
based on a dubious report by a Swede, J. C. Jo-
hanson, who on February 16, 1932, took a
photo of a 38-foot-long, lizardlike monster in
the Kasai Valley on the border of Angola and
Democratic Republic of the Congo.
In May 1954, Alan Brignall saw a small head
and long neck rise up out of the water about 25
yards from the shore of Lake Bangweulu, Zam-
bia. The head had a distinct brow, blunt nose,
and visible jawline, and it moved from side to
side. After a few seconds, it sank down vertically
and disappeared.
Possible explanations:
(1) A ceratopsian dinosaur, suggested by
Karl Shuker, although this suborder is not
known from Africa. Better-known species
include Monoclonius, Psittacosaurus,
Protoceratops, and Triceratops. Usually, these
dinosaurs had a large frill or flange around
the head along with facial horns.
(2) A surviving saber-toothed cat, suggested
by Bernard Heuvelmans.
(3) An unknown species of aquatic
rhinoceros, suggested by Denis David Lyell.
(4) Old, solitary, exceptionally aggressive
male Hippopotamuses ( Hippopotamus
amphibius) that attack boats and other
hippos, according to Alain Chevillat.
(5) William Hichens suggested a surviving
chalicothere, a family of fossil ungulates that
lived 25 million years ago in the Miocene
and survived in East Africa until 12,000
years ago. However, they were ground-based
terrestrial browsers and not amphibious.

Chollier’s Ape
Unknown PRIMATE of West Africa.
Etymology: After its only observer.
Physical description: Size of a man. Dense
black hair.
Distribution: Southeastern Mali near the
Burkina Faso border.
Significant sighting: In 1938, Louis Chollier
was on safari south of Tiou Tiou, Mali, when
his party came across a huge, black animal with
long hair that looked like a bear or an ape. It
disappeared into the rocks before they could
pursue it.
Possible explanation: An escaped Chimpanzee
( Pan troglodytes) or a remnant population of
chimps left over from the species’ former range.

Chuchunaa
GlANTHOMINID of eastern Siberia.
Etymology: Related to Yakut (Turkic) word
for “fugitive” or “outcast.”
Variant names: Abas, Abasy, Chuchuna,
Kuchena, Kuchuna, Mulen (Evenki/Altaic,
“bandit”), Mulena, Siberian snowman.
Physical description: Heavily built. Height,
usually 6 feet 6 inches-7 feet, though smaller
sizes are reported. Long, matted head-hair.
Lively expression. Big, black face. Protruding
browridge. Small forehead, nose, and eyes.
Broad chin. Heavy beard. Wide shoulders on
relatively narrow body. Long arms.
Behavior: Travels singly or in small groups.
May migrate south in the summer. Swift run-
ner. Excellent swimmer. Incapable of speech but
utters a piercing, modulated whistle. Hunts and
eats reindeer and mountain goats. Catches or
steals fishes from nets. Picks wild berries. Lives
in caves. Allegedly raids settlements to steal
food. Normally shy but occasionally picks fights
with hunters or herders. Wears deerskin cloth-
ing, boots, and headband. Uses a knife, spear,
and fire-steel, as well as a bow and feathered ar-
rows in a quiver. Throws stones when otherwise
unarmed.
Distribution: From the east bank of the Lena
River, Sakha Republic, to the Chukotskiy
Peninsula, Chukot Autonomous Province,
Siberia, with concentrations in the Verkhoyansk
and Poloustnaya Ranges and the upland massifs
east of the Yana and Indigirka Rivers, Sakha Re-
public; as far south as the Khrebet Dzhugdzhur
Range, Khabarovsk Territory, Siberian Russia.
Significant sightings: Many Mulen were said
to have been killed during the Russian Civil
War, 1918-1921, when refugees moved into
previously uninhabited areas.
In the 1920s, Tatyana Zakharova and other
Evenk villagers came across a Chuchunaa while
gathering berries near Khoboyuto Creek. It was
also picking and eating berries, but it stood up
to a full height of nearly 7 feet when it saw them
and ran away swiftly. The Chuchunaa was
dressed in deerskin, had long arms, a small fore-
head, and jutting chin.
In czarist times and during World War II,
many Chuchunaa were said to have been
104 CHOLLIER’S APE
rounded up and killed, their corpses buried
secretly.
Possible explanations:
(1) Neanderthals ( Homo neanderthalensis ) ,
cold-adapted hominids of Europe and West
Asia that flourished 70,000-35,000 years
ago, have been proposed by Myra Shackley,
although the nearest fossils are some
ambiguous teeth found in the Middle
Paleolithic layers of Denisova Cave in the
Altai Mountains bordering Kazakhstan. The
Chuchunaa and Mulen may actually
represent a more advanced archaic human,
since their toolkit seems more developed.
(2) Homo gardarensis , proposed by Mark
Hall, although this medieval skeleton from
Greenland is now universally considered to
be a Norseman with acromegaly, a skull
deformity caused by a malfunctioning
pituitary gland.
(3) Paleoasiatic aborigines who have
retreated into wilderness areas, suggested by
Russian scientist S. Nikolaev.
(4) Completely mythical beings of the
Siberian nomadic tribes, suggested by G. V.
Ksenofontov.

CHUNUCKLAS 105
Chupacabras
Paranormal ENTITY of the West Indies, South
America, and parts of North America.
Etymology: Spanish, “goat-sucker.”
Variant names: Canguro (“kangaroo”),
Ciguapas (in Dominican Republic), Comeco-
gollos (“banana- tree eater”), Conejo (“rabbit”),
Gallinejo (contraction of gallina, “chicken,” and
conejo ), Goatsucker, Maboya (Tamo/Arawakan,
“evil spirit”), Moca vampire, Sacalenguas
(“draw tongue,” in El Salvador).
Physical description: Height, 4-5 feet. Cov-
ered in short, gray fur. Said to have a
chameleon-like ability to change color. Skin ap-
pears to have darkened spots. Large, round
head. Huge, lidless, fiery-red eyes run up to the
temples and spread to the sides; white sclera not
present. Ears small or absent. Two small nos-
trils. Lipless mouth. Sharp, protruding fangs.
Pointy spikes run from the head down the
spine; these may double as wings. Attached to
the spikes are fleshy membranes that vary in
color from blue to red or purple. Thin arms
with three webbed fingers. Red claws. Muscular
but thin hind legs. Three clawed toes. No tail.
Behavior: Nocturnal. Moves awkwardly with
arms outstretched or by hopping. Said to be able
to jump over trees. Kills goats, chickens, sheep,
and other farm animals and drinks their blood.
Animal victims generally have two or three cir-
cular puncture wounds about 0.25-0.5 inches
in diameter in the neck or lower jaw; often, one
of the wounds punctures the cerebellum. In
some cases, organs are said to have been re-
moved.
Tracks: Leaves a trail of slime and rancid
meat. Tracks vary; some near Miami were 5
inches long by 4.5 inches wide.
Distribution: Puerto Rico; Dominican Re-
public; Sinaloa, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nayarit,
Veracruz, and Jalisco States, Mexico; Donna
and San Antonio, Texas; Miami area, Florida;

Massachusetts; Boaco and Tolapa, Nicaragua;
Costa Rica; El Salvador; Guatemala; Calama,
Chile; Varginha and Sorocaba, Sao Paulo State,
Brazil; Touloes, Castelo Branco District, Portu-
gal; Valmaseda, in Spain’s Basque Country.
Significant sightings: In Moca, Puerto Rico, in
March 1975, something was killing cows, goats,
pigs, and geese and draining all their blood.
Deep stab or puncture wounds were found on
the carcasses, causing the perpetrator to be
christened the Moca vampire. Killer snakes and
birds were blamed, and the Puerto Rico Agri-
cultural Commission called on the police for a
full investigation. On March 25, Juan Muniz
became the first human to be attacked by what
he described as a “horrible creature covered in
feathers,” forcing him to hide behind some
bushes. In April, other towns on the island re-
ported animal killings and attacks by a weird
bird or doglike animal or unidentified flying ob-
ject (UFO) aliens, but reports died out after a
few more weeks.
In March 1991, another rash of pig, goose,
and chicken killings erupted in Lares, Puerto
Rico. Residents reported an apelike creature,
while officials blamed feral dogs. In June 1991,
livestock predation at Aguada was accompanied
by reports of banana trees being ripped apart by
something the island press dubbed Comecogol-
los, a hairy BlGFOO Twith glowing eyes.
Eight sheep were found dead with three
puncture wounds and drained of blood in Oro-
covis, Puerto Rico, in early March 1995.
In the second week of August 1995, Made-
lyne Tolentino of Canovanas, Puerto Rico, was
one of the first to see the Chupacabras responsi-
ble for a series of about 150 animal deaths in the
area. It was about 4 feet tall, dark gray, with
skinny arms and legs and apparent burn marks
on its abdomen. It seemed to have feathers
along its spine.
Mrs. Bernardo Gomez of Caguas, Puerto
Rico, on November 15, 1995, saw a hairy, red-
eyed beast rip open a bedroom window, destroy
a stuffed teddy bear, and leave a puddle of slime
and rancid meat on the windowsill.
Residents of San German, Puerto Rico,
chased a Chupacabras away November 16,
1995, just as it was about to kill three fighting
roosters. It had large, almond-shaped eyes, an
oval face, and small hands protruding from its
shoulders.
On November 28, 1995, a hand- or footprint
was found after an attack at Vega Baja, Puerto
Rico. It showed 6 fingers or toes.
106 CHUPACABRAS
The CHUPACABRAS, a paranormal entity responsible for killing livestock in Puerto Rico and Mexico in the 1990s. (John
Sibbick and Fortean Times/Fortean Picture Library)
Osvaldo Rosado of Guanica, Puerto Rico,
claimed that on December 23, 1995, he was
grabbed from behind by a gorilla-like animal
that gave him a bear hug so tight that wounds
appeared on his abdomen.
A Chupacabras killed a pair of sheep at Cano-
vanas, Puerto Rico, on January 8, 1996. Jose
Febo saw it sitting in a tamarind tree; when it
saw him, it jumped down and ran off like a
gazelle.
On March 9, 1996, Ovidio Mendez of Aguas
Buenas, Puerto Rico, was burying a dead and
mutilated chicken when he saw a creature 4 feet
tall and walking on two legs. It had large fangs,
red eyes, pointed ears, and clawlike hands.
About sixty-nine animals — goats and fowl —
were killed in Sweetwater, Florida, in March
1996. Teide Carballo saw a dark-brown, mon-
keylike creature walking on two legs like a
hunchback. Dade County officials attributed
the attacks to wild dogs.
From March through May 1996, numerous
Chupacabras reports were made in Mexico.
Teodora Ayala Reyes in a village in Sinaloa State
and Jose Angel Pulido in Tlajomulco de Zuniga,
Jalisco State, both claimed to be cut or bitten by
a Chupacabras. By late May, there were forty-six
attacks on 300 animals and four people. Mexi-
can Chupacabras were said to be more rodent-
like and only 3 feet tall.
Violeta Colorado’s dogs cornered a strange
animal in Zapotal, Mexico, on May 9, 1996. It
hissed weirdly and escaped. The same night,
nine sheep were killed nearby and their blood
drained.
Fifty animals were found drained of blood on
a farm near Utuando, Puerto Rico, on Novem-
ber 20, 1997. Twin triangular perforations ap-
peared on their stomachs.
On May 3, 2000, in Concepcion, Chile, Lil-
iana Romero Castillo was awakened by barking
dogs and looked out to see a 7-foot, winged hu-
manoid in her garden. At 6 PM. the next day,
her children found a dead, bloodless dog with
two puncture marks at its throat. The Chilean
military police removed it shortly afterward.
Some 200 sheep were killed in the area
around Calama, Antofagasta Region, Chile, in
the first twenty days in May 2000. A half-
human, half- animal shape had been seen. The
events were blamed on National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA) genetic ex-
periments that got out of control.
On the night of August 28, 2001, a couple
were returning home from a church meeting in
Calama, Chile, when they saw a small, hairy,
gray-and-white figure by the side of the road
coming out of the bushes. It was apparently sus-
pended a few inches off the ground. It sped
across the road in an oddly rigid manner.
On January 12, 2002, two teenagers near
Calama, Chile, reported a 6-foot-tall, dog-
headed, football-shaped monster that hopped
menacingly toward them. It had three fingers
and toes and a tail 2 inches thick.
Present status : Modern reports began quietly
around 1974, peaked in 1995 and 1996, and
began to decline in frequency in 1997, with a
reoccurrence in Chile beginning in 2000.
Possible explanations:
(1) Folklore in the making, spread by
contagion as stories are made up,
misinterpreted, repeated, and embellished.
(2) Ritual killings by practitioners of
Santeria or youthful delinquents.
(3) Paranormal origins prevail in the
popular press: aliens from an unidentified
flying object (UFO), genetic experiments
gone awry, or black magic.
(4) A freshwater MEEBEING, suggested by
Loren Coleman, based apparently on its
clumsy gait or webbed fingers and toes.
(5) The Long-tailed weasel (. Mustela frenata )
feeds on small mammals, but it is not native
to Puerto Rico, which has no large wild
mammals except for monkeys (see below)
and some mongooses introduced to control
rats on sugarcane plantations.
(6) Feral Domestic dogs ( Canis familiaris)
could be responsible for some of the
livestock depredations.
(7) Predation by escaped Rhesus monkeys
( Macaco mulatto) that had been brought to
offshore islands for research purposes,
suggested by Juan A. Rivero of the
University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez.
Fugitive monkeys have spread through the
island as a result of an escape at a facility at
108 CHUPACABRAS
La Paraguera in the 1970s. However, these
macaques usually eat insects, shoots, fruit,
and seeds, with the occasional small animal;
even a troop would not attack a goat.
(8) Humberto Cota Gil blamed the False
vampire bat ( Vampyrum spectrum) for
animal attacks in Sinaloa, Mexico, although
this bat does not range this far north and
limits its prey to birds, other bats, and small
rodents.
(9) The Band-winged nightjar ( Caprimulgus
longirostris) , a night-flying, insect-eating
bird related to the whippoorwill that ranges
from Venezuela to Argentina, was said to
have contributed to the sightings because its
name in Spanish is chotacabras.

Chuti
HYENA-like animal, depicted in traditional art of
Central Asia.
Physical description: Canine head. Tigerlike
stripes. Has four forward claws and one rear
claw.
Behavior: Kills cattle. Leaves humans alone.
Distribution: Choyang and Iswa Valleys,
Makalu-Barun National Park, Nepal.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Striped hyena ( Hyaena hyaena ) has
well-defined stripes on its body and limbs
and a massive head. It is common in open
country and less abundant in the forested
regions of Nepal.
(2) Confusion with the similarly named
hominid- or bearlike DzuTeh.

Physical description: Said to be half tiger, half
ape. Smaller but more heavily built than the
tiger. Unpatterned yellow or tan fur. Neck ruff.
Short tail.
Behavior: Aggressive. Said to attack humans
without provocation.
Distribution: Wilderness east of Mount Ker-
inci and south toward Bangko, Sumatra, In-
donesia.

CIVETS AND MONGOOSES
(Unknown)
Civets and mongooses are carnivores, more
primitive than DOGS or CATS, belonging to the
Family Viverridae. They share a common ances-
tor and probably originated in Africa 30 million
years ago in the Oligocene.
Civets are medium-sized carnivores of Africa
and Asia with long bodies and relatively short
legs. Most species have stripes, spots, or bands
on their bodies, and their tails are often ringed
with contrasting colors. Their claws are retrac-
tile. Most have perianal (not anal) glands that
produce a strong-smelling substance; in some
species, the odor is sufficiently potent to ward
off predators. The secretion, called civet, is used
as a perfume base and medicine.
Mystery civets: A civet in Ceram, Indonesia,
apparently with an 18-inch tail covered in fur
with dark rings, was found by Tyson Hughes in
1986. Locals describe the animal as half dog,
half cat. There are no known civets in Ceram.
Two unusual civet specimens have been re-
ported by Dr. Pham Nhat in Lao Cai Province,
Vietnam.
Sightings of a wild dog-like animal in Java, In-
donesia, called the Anjing hutan and thought to
be the Dhole ( Cuon alpinus ), have been shown in
some instances to be a surviving population of
the Sulawesi palm civet ( Macrogalidia musschen-
broeki ), thought extinct since the 1940s.
Mongooses typically have pointed heads, long
tails, and thick hair, except on the lower legs. In-
dian mongooses of the genus Herpestes are used
by snake charmers to entertain tourists with
cobra shows. Though not completely immune to
cobra venom, the mongoose’s speed, agility, and
erectile fur usually make the snake miss its mark.
Mystery mongooses: An odd, gray, musky, ring-
tailed animal with a blunt snout that was killed
by a dog near Pablo, Montana, in 1980 may
have been an escaped pet mongoose of some
kind. However, importation of these animals is
tightly controlled. There are no known indige-
nous viverrids in North America.
The Malagasy cryptid BOKYBOKY is probably
the Narrow-striped mongoose ( Mungotictus de-
cemlineatd).

Clear Lake Catfish
Odd Fish of California.
Physical description: Coelacanth-like fish with
leglike lobed fins. Doglike head. Barbels. Dis-
tinctive scales. Horizontally oriented tail.
Distribution: Clear Lake, California.
Significant sighting: In October 1993, Lyle
Dyslin caught a strange-looking, dog-headed
fish; after taking photographs of it, he released it
back into the lake because it reminded him of
his dachshund.
Possible explanation: Malformed catfish or, less
likely, a dramatic new species. Clear Lake is
known for its large Channel catfish {Ictalurus
punctatus ), which put up a struggle when hooked.
Catfishes are not native to California but began
to be introduced sometime in the 1870s.

Coelacanth (Unrecorded Populations)
The Coelacanth is the only surviving member of
a class of lobefin FISHES that dates back 400 mil-
lion years, to the Early Devonian. No fossil
Coelacanths have been found that are more re-
cent than the Cretaceous period, 65 million
years ago.
Etymology: Former genus name, from the
Greek koilos (“hollow”) + akantha (“spine”).
Scientific names: Latimeria chalumnae, given
by J. L. B. Smith in 1939 for the Indian Ocean
species; L. menadoensis, given in 1999 for the
Celebes Sea species.
Variant names: Ikan fomar (in Java), Patuki
(Rapa Nui/Austronesian).
Physical description: Length, 5 feet. Weight,
up to 150 pounds. Slate-blue with white flecks.
Thick, armorlike scales, lined with serrated rows
I 10 CIVETS AND MONGOOSES
of hardened, toothpick-pointed denticles. Rays
of the first dorsal fin are arranged like a fan, but
the second dorsal, pectoral, and pelvic fins are
lobed. Three-lobed tail. A pressure-sensitive lat-
eral line senses the proximity of other fishes and
surrounding structures.
Behavior: Congregates in submarine caves in
the daytime. Sculls in an upside-down position
with paired pectoral and pelvic fins moving in
unison.
Distribution: Now known from the Comoro
Islands and nearby African waters and off Su-
lawesi in Indonesia. Evidence for their presence
in the South Pacific, the Gulf of Mexico, the
coast of India, and Java is tenuous yet intriguing.
Significant sightings:
Off Easter Island — The Easter Islanders have
legends of a Coelacanth-like fish called the
Patuki, which has leglike fins.
In the Gulf of Mexico — A Tampa, Florida,
souvenir seller bought a bucketful of Coelacanth
scales, now lost, from a local fisherman in 1949.
Silver ornaments in the shape of a Coelacanth,
apparently dating from the seventeenth to eigh-
teenth centuries, were found in Bilbao and
Toledo, Spain, in 1964 and 1965; initially
thought to have originated in the Spanish
colonies of North America, they were shown, in
2001, to be recent manufactures using the Co-
moran coelacanth as a model.
Off the coast of India — An eighteenth-century
Indian miniature painting shows a Muslim holy
man standing beside a Coelacanth-like fish with
armorlike scales.
Java- — George Serres caught a 25-pound spec-
imen in 1995 off southwestern Java, though
documentation was later lost. Local people know
about the fish, which they call Ikan fomar.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Spanish silver ornaments may have
been based on a fossil Coelacanth, though
its three-dimensional shape conforms well
with the living fish.
(2) The Indian miniature painting could
portray the Climbing perch (Anabas
testudineus) , found in India and Southeast
Asia, which is famous for its ability to
survive several days out of water.

Coje Ya Menia
WlER Lion of Central Africa.
Etymology: Mbundu-Loanda (Bantu), “water
lion.”
Physical description: Slightly smaller than a
hippopotamus. Has tusks or large canine teeth.
Behavior: Nocturnal. Amphibious. Moves to
smaller rivers and swamps during the rainy sea-
son. Makes a loud, rumbling roar. Kills hip-
popotamuses but does not eat them.
Tracks: Like an elephant’s but with toes over-
printed on the impression of the sole.
Habitat: Rivers and swamps.
Distribution: Upper Cuango and Cuanza
Rivers, Angola, and smaller tributaries.
Significant sighting: In the 1930s, a Por-
tuguese truck driver heard that a Coje ya menia
had killed a hippopotamus along the Cuango
River the night before. He went off with some
trackers and for several hours followed the trail
of the hippo and another smaller animal. They
found the dead, uneaten hippo ripped to shreds
in an area where the grass and shrubs had been
crushed down.
Possible explanations:
(1) A surviving aquatic saber-toothed cat,
first suggested by Ingo Krumbiegel in 1 947.
(2) An unknown monitor lizard.
(3) A surviving dinosaur of some type.

Coleman Frog
Giant AMPHIBIAN of New Brunswick, Canada.
Physical description: Like a huge bullfrog.
Length, 27 inches. Weight, 42 pounds.
Behavior: Consumes baked beans, June bugs,
whiskey, and buttermilk toddies. Said to have
been used to tow canoes and race against tomcats.
Distribution: Killarney Lake, New Brunswick.
Present status: Said to have been dynamited
from the lake in 1885. On display for many
years at Fred B. Coleman’s Barker House Hotel,
the lone specimen was donated to the York-
Sudbury Historical Museum, Fredericton, in
1959.
Possible explanations:
(1) Bullfrogs ( Rana catesbeiand) only grow
to 8 inches long. The record weight is 1
pound 4 ounces.
(2) A fake, made to advertise a patent
medicine for relieving sore throats. A 1988
report by the Canadian Conservation
Institute refers to the artifact as consisting of
canvas, wax, and paint. A letter refers to the
exhibit as “an amusing example of a colossal
fake and deception.”

Colossal Claude
Sea Monster of Oregon.
Variant name: Marvin.
Physical description: Length, 15-40 feet.
Round, tan body. Snake- or horselike head.
Neck, 8 feet long. Long tail.
Behavior: Raids fishing lines.
Distribution: Mouth of the Columbia River,
Oregon, and the neighboring seacoast.
Significant sightings: In 1934, L. A. Larson,
mate of the Columbia River lightship, saw a 40-
foot animal at the mouth of the river. Crew mem-
bers studied it for some time with binoculars.
In 1963, the Shell Oil Company during an
oil search off the Oregon coast recorded a video-
tape that shows a 15-foot animal with barnacled
ridges swimming in 180 feet of water.

Colovia
Unknown SNAKE of Southern Europe.
Physical description: Serpentine. Length, 11
feet. Scaly.
Distribution: Sicily, Italy.
Significant sighting: A snakelike animal was
tracked down and killed in a marsh near Sira-
cusa, Sicily, in December 1933. It was destroyed
because local superstition held that its appear-
ance presaged disaster.
Possible explanation: Escaped python or boa
(Family Boidae).
Source: Times (London), December 27 and
29, 1933.
Columbus’s Ape-Faced Cat
Odd C AT or other mammal of Central America,
seen on Columbus’s fourth voyage.
Physical description: Large cat. Apelike face.
Prehensile tail.
Behavior: Aggressive. Killed a peccary with
only its foreleg and thick tail.
Distribution: Costa Rica.
Significant sighting: Christopher Columbus
sent an armed party into the interior of Costa
Rica in 1502, and this odd-looking animal was
captured.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Central American spider monkey
( Ateles geojfroyi) has a prehensile tail and a
catlike body 1-2 feet long. The Costa Rican
variety is brown to silvery above, lighter
below. It growls and acts threatening when
disturbed, but whether this fruit-eating
112 COLEMAN FROG
monkey, even if provoked, could dispatch a
pig is doubtful.
(2) The Kinkajou ( Potos flavus ), a relative of
the raccoon, is even more catlike, also has a
prehensile tail, and is common in Central
American forests. However, it is extremely
docile.
(3) An unknown species of carnivorous cat,
now extinct, suggested by Herbert Wendt.
Sources: Letter from Christopher Columbus
to the King and Queen of Spain, July 7, 1503,

Christopher Columbus (New York: Penguin,
1969), p. 298; Herbert Wendt, Out of Noah’s
Ark (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1959).
Columbus’s Serpent
Mystery Ckxddiu AN of the West Indies.
Physical description: Described as a sierpe
(“snake”). Length, 5 feet.
Habitat: Freshwater lagoon.
Distribution: Crooked Island, Bahamas.
Significant sighting: On October 21, 1492,
Christopher Columbus’s men killed a “snake”
on the northwest coast of Crooked Island in the
Bahamas. Martin Alonso Pinzon of the Pinta
killed another one the next day. He planned to
skin one and return it to Spain; however, no
such skin has been preserved.
Possible explanations:
(1) Long thought to have been an Iguana
(Family Iguanidae), although these large
lizards rarely enter water and there is no
fossil evidence for them on the island.
(2) When remains of a village site visited
by Columbus was excavated in 1987,
the femur from an American crocodile
( Crocodylus acutus) was discovered. Its
size indicated it belonged to an animal
about 4 feet long. Though it may not have
been the animal killed by Columbus’s men,
it shows that crocodiles used to live on the

Con Rit
Multi finned Sea Monster of the China Sea.
Etymology: Vietnamese (Austroasiatic) name
for a millipede with a toxic bite.
Physical description: Length, 60 feet. Dark
brown above, light yellow below. Body com-
posed of armored segments 2 feet long and 3
feet wide. A pair of thin appendages, 2 feet 4
inches long, is attached to each segment.
Distribution: Halong Bay, Vietnam.
Significant sighting: Tran Van Con and other
Vietnamese found a carcass washed ashore at
Hong Gai, Vietnam, around 1883. The head
was gone, but the remainder was formed of odd
segmented joints that rang like sheet metal
when hit with a stick. It smelled so badly that it
was towed out to sea.
Possible explanations:
(1) The backbone of a whale, though the
vertebral structure should have been obvious
and described in a different way.
(2) The caudal vertebrae of an Oarfish
{Regalecus glesne) . However, its bones are
shaped differently, and this fish generally
only grows to 36 feet.
(3) Surviving archaic basilosaurid whale,
similar to those in Bernard Heuvelmans’s
Multi finned Sea MoNSTERcategory,
which he theorized had armored plates.
However, it’s now known that basilosaurids
were not armored.
(4) A surviving Sea scorpion (Class
Eurypterida), a group of arthropods that
flourished from the Ordovician to the
Permian periods, 500—250 million years
ago, had an abdomen divided into twelve
segments, but no appendages were attached
to them. In addition, they actually lived in
brackish or freshwater instead of the open
sea, and the largest one, a species of
Pterygotus, only reached 9 feet in length.
(5) A giant crustacean of an unknown type,
proposed by Karl Shuker. The carcass
represents only the exoskeleton and limbs.
However, the largest known living
CON RIT 113
crustacean is the Japanese spider crab
( Macrocheira kaempferi ), which has a claw
span of 10-12 feet but a body size not
much over 1 foot — nowhere near the size of
the Con rit.

Coromandel Man
WlIDMAN of Australasia.
Etymology: From the mountain range.
Variant names: Forest taniwah, Hairy moe-
hau, Matau, Moehau monster, Toangina, Tu-
uhourangi.
Physical description: Covered with red or silver
hair.
Habitat: Caves.
Distribution: Coromandel Range, Waikato
River, and Tongariro National Park, North Is-
land, New Zealand; Cameron Mountains, Mil-
ford Wilderness, and Lake Wakatipu, South Is-
land, New Zealand.
Significant sightings: In 1878, gold prospec-
tors on Martha Hill in Waihi reported large,
long-haired man-beasts carrying stone knives,
hand axes, and wooden clubs.
Large, five-toed, humanlike footprints were
found embedded in mud along a creek in 1903
by miners in the Karangahake Gorge.
In early February 1952, hunters Douglas
Tainvhana and Roy Norman got a fleeting
glimpse of a hairy man running along a track on
the Coromandel Peninsula.
In 1963, Carl McNeil saw an apelike creature
running along a track bed on the Coromandel
Peninsula.
Trevor Silcox was hunting wild pig with a
companion in the Coromandel Range in 1972
when they spotted a 6-foot, naked man covered
with dark hair moving through the scrub. Four
tracks measuring 14 inches long and 7 inches
wide were found.
Possible explanation: A surviving remnant of
postulated pre-Maori inhabitants of New
Zealand.

Cressie
FRESHmTER Monster of Newfoundland,
Canada.
Etymology: After the lake.
Variant names: Cressiteras anguilloida (quasi-
scientific name), Haoot tuwedyee (possibly
Beothuk/Algonquian, “swimming demon”),
Woodum haoot (“pond devil”).
Physical description: Serpentine. Length, 15
feet. Black. Rounded hump. No fins or flukes.
Behavior: Swims with a rolling motion.
Distribution: Crescent Lake, Newfoundland.
Significant sightings: Around June 7, 1960,
Bruce Anthony and three other loggers watched
an object that looked like an overturned boat
swim and cross a nearby sandbar.
On September 5, 1991, Pierce Rideout saw
an unusual wave and then a black, 1 5-foot ani-
mal swimming with a rolling motion about 150
yards offshore.
Possible explanation: An oversized American
eel ( Anguilla ro strata), which normally grows to
less than 5 feet. Eels usually spawn in the ocean,
but they have never been seen in Tommy’s Arm
Brook, Crescent Lake’s only outlet to the sea.
However, the lake’s deeper water is saline,
which might allow the eels to stay in the lake to
spawn.

114 COROMANDEL MAN
Cretan Pterosaur
Flying Reptile of Southern Europe.
Physical description: Batlike. Pelican-like beak.
Fingerlike protrusions on the wings. Large
claws.
Distribution: Crete.
Significant sighting: A flying reptile was seen
in the summer of 1986 in the Asteroussia
Mountains, near Pirgos, Crete, by three youths
who were hunting. It was large and dark gray,
with membranous wings that made a flapping
noise as it flew over them slowly.

CROCODILIANS (Unknown)
Crocodiles, alligators, and gavials are the three
families of living Crocodilians (Order Croco-
dylia) containing twenty-two species. Modern
crocodilians have a full secondary palate that al-
lows them to breathe and eat at the same time,
just like a mammal. They are semiaquatic am-
bush predators that hunt in water but go on
land to bask in the sun. Although they generally
will eat whatever they can catch (including out-
board motors and gas tanks), crocs prefer large
fishes, birds, turtles, and mammals.
The oldest known modern crocodilian was
Hylaeochampa vectiana from the Early Creta-
ceous, 110 million years ago, from the Isle of
Wight, England. One of the largest crocodiles
ever was the 30- to 50-foot Deinosuchus y found
in the Late Cretaceous of North America; its
skull alone measures 6 feet 6 inches in length.
Another was the 40-foot, 10-ton Sarcosuchus
from the Tenere Desert, Niger, which had a
massive growth on the end of its snout, was cov-
ered with bony plates, and thrived 110-90 mil-
lion years ago. The order diversified successfully
by the end of the Mesozoic and flourished in the
Cenozoic. Different species spread as far north
as Sweden in Europe ( Thoracosaurus macro -
rhynchus) and Alberta and Saskatchewan in
North America ( Leidyosuchus canadensis and Bo-
realosuchus acutidentatus ) .
The largest living crocodilian is the Saltwater
crocodile ( Crocodylus porosus) , found from South-
east Asia to northern Australia and the Solomon
Islands. The average length for mature males is
14-16 feet, but outsize specimens greater than 23
feet long have been reliably reported.
Of the nine animals in this list, three (LlP ATA,
MAHAMBA, and the SULAWESI LAKE C IOCODI LE)
may be surviving fossil species. The others are
distribution anomalies, a mundane explanation
for a lake monster (MlGO), and an odd color
variant (PlNK AlLIGAIOR).

Crowing Crested Cobra
Mystery SNAKE of East and Central Africa.
Variant names: Bubu (on the Lower Zambezi
River in Mozambique), Hongo (Ngindo/
Bantu), Inkhomi (Ngoni/Bantu and Nyakyusa-
Ngonde/Bantu, “the killer”), Kovoko (Nyam-
wezi/Bantu), Mbobo (Rungwa/Bantu), N’gok-
wiki (Gbaya/Ubangi), Ngoshe (Bemba/ Bantu),
Songo (Yao/Bantu, “strikes down at the head”).
Physical description: Cobralike snake. Length,
up to 20 feet. Buff-brown or grayish-black.
Bright red, forward-projecting crest on its head.
Scarlet face. The male has a pair of red facial
wattles. The dorsal vertebra of one specimen
had articulating surfaces of 8 x 9 millimeters.
Behavior: Arboreal. May also be aquatic. Ex-
tremely vicious. The male makes a loud sound
like a rooster crowing. The female makes a hen-
like clucking sound. Both male and female emit
a warning cry of “chu-chu-chu-chu.” Leeds on
maggots from rotting flesh; it supposedly kills
animals so that maggots will grow on the car-
casses. Also eats hyraxes. Attacks humans by
lunging down from a tree toward the head or
face. The venom is extremely toxic, resulting in
death almost instantaneously.
Habitat: Trees, hills, rocks.
Distribution: KwaZulu-Natal Province,
South Africa; Mozambique; Zimbabwe;
Malawi; Zambia; Tanzania; Central African Re-
public.
CROWING CRESTED COBRA I 15
Significant sightings: From a witch doctor in
Malawi, J. O. Shircore obtained a plate of bone
from the crest (with bits of skin attached), some
neck bones, and several vertebrae from at least
two different specimens of this snake.
In May 1959, John Knott accidentally ran
over a 7-foot black snake in his Land Rover in
the Lake Kariba area of Zimbabwe. It had a
symmetrical crest on its head that could be
erected by raising five bony structures.
Possible explanations:
(1) A nonexistent composite of several
different snakes, suggested by Charles R. S.
Pitman, who also proposed that the crowing
was not done by the snake but by its
victims.
(2) The Gaboon adder ( Bitis gabonica) has a
pair of hornlike scales on its snout, and its
head is pale brown with a dark central line.
It is now endangered and found only in
coastal Natal and eastern Zimbabwe.
Pitman noted in the 1930s that in
Kawambwa, Zambia, people thought the
animal had a crest and made a crowing
noise.
(3) The Rhinoceros viper ( Bitis nasicornih
of West and Central Africa has a flat,
triangular-shaped head with two or three
hornlike projections. Its brilliant color
patterns vary among individuals.
(4) The Black mamba ( Dendroaspis
polylepis ), Africa’s most feared snake, is
found from Kenya to Mozambique. It
sometimes carries molted skin on its head,
which makes it look crested. It is also
rumored to lunge down at people from
trees.
(5) An unknown species of venomous snake
with a crest or frill.
(6) The Puff adder ( Bitis arietans) of South
Africa is known to emit a bell-like note; the
Indian cobra ( Naja naja) is said to purr or
hiss; and the Bornean cave racer ( Elaphe
taeniurae grabowskyi) makes an eerie,
meowing sound. However, these snakes
have no vocal cords, so they must produce
the sounds using other frictive organs.

walk on land. Creates large wakes.
116 CU SITH
Distribution: Lago Lacar and Lago Nahuel
Huapi, Neuquen Province, Argentina; other
lakes in the region, including Chile; also said to
be marine.
Possible explanations:
(1) Jorge Luis Borges characterized the
animal as a F RESHWOER OCIOP US.
(2) Karl Shuker has suggested an unknown
species of large, freshwater jellyfish, perhaps
related to the Moon jelly (. Aurelia aurita)
found near the coast and inland in warm
and tropical waters. It ranges in size from 2
to 16 inches.
(3) An evolved Sea scorpion (Class
Eurypterida), which flourished from the
Ordovician to the Permian periods,
500-250 million years ago, proposed by
Mark Hall. One species, Pterygotus
bujfaloensis , attained a length of 9 feet and
was the largest known arthropod. Sea
scorpions were roughly cylindrical and had
distinct latitudinal scales.

mestic pig sow ( Sus scrofa scrofa ) x and a polled
Domestic ram ( Ovis aries). Curly hair is black,
white, black and white, or brown and white.
Distribution: Oaxaca State, Mexico.
Present status: The name is now a Spanish syn-

Cuitlamiztli
Unknown C AT or HYENA of Mexico.
Etymology: Nahuatl (Uto-Aztecan), “glutton
. 5J
cat.
Physical description: Pumalike animal.
Behavior: Attacks and eats deer ravenously,
hence its name.
Distribution: Mexico.
Significant sighting: In the Aztec ruler’s
menagerie at Teotihuacan, Mexico, Bernal Diaz
reported seeing in 1520 a wolflike animal,
which some have equated with the Cuitlamiztli.
Possible explanations:
(1) The ONZA, though this cat is now
considered a regional variation of the Puma
( Puma concolor ).
(2) Surviving Chasmaporthetes ossifragus, the
only fossil hyaenid found in North America,
suggested by Karl Shuker to explain Diaz’s
animal. It was a mobile hunter that lived 2
million-10,000 years ago, from the Pliocene
to the Pleistocene. However, Diaz’s
description is so vague that it might even
refer to a Coyote ( Canis latrans).

tawny background color, with an orange gloss
on the shoulders. Small spots coalesced on its
back t o form a solid black color from head t o
t ail. The underpart s looked like a t ypical leop-
ard’s (white with large spots). Its total length
was 6 feet 7 inches.
Anot her specimen was killed in Kerala St at e,
southwestern India, in 1912. The rosettes were
fused into a solid black over the entire upper
body.
G. Hamilt on -Snowball shot a large, dark
leopard in the Aberdare Highlands, Kenya, in
t he 1920s. The local Gikuyu people t old him it
was called a Damasia and was different from a
leopard.
A mount ed leopard, supposedly obt ained in
Belize, is on display at t he Wildlife World Mu-
seum in Springfield, Missouri. Its background
color is a very dark reddish-brown.
Present status: Melanist ic Leopards ( Panthera
pardus) have an abnormally dark background
color, but the rosettes are still visible under
proper light ing condit ions or up close. They are
common in Myanmar, peninsular Malaysia,
sout hern India, Java, sout hwest ern China, and
some part s of Nepal and Assam. Black leopards
are less common in Africa, though they have
been report ed in Et hiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, and
Cameroon.
Pseudomelanist ic leopards are known from
only a few specimens. The background color is
a normal orange-yellow, but t he roset t es are so
abundant t hat t hey have fused t oget her int o a
solid black color over port ions of t he coat . The
normal background color is somet imes visible in
thin, irregular yellow streaks. Though docu-
ment ed, t he pseudomelanist ic morph is not well
known and might be misint erpret ed as an un-
known animal if it is found unexpect edly.
Brown mut ant s are also on record.

De Loys’s Ape
Apelike PRIMATE of Sout h America.
Scientific names: Ameranthropoides loysi , pro-
posed by George Mont an don in 1929; Ateles
loysi , proposed by Arthur Keith in 1929 to
count er Mont andon.
Physical description: Gibbonlike primat e.
Thick coat of long, grayish-brown hair. Height ,
5 feet 1.75 inches. Oval face, with developed

t he forehead. Round ridges surrounding t he eye
socket s. Flat nose wit h flared nost rils. Powerful
jaws wit h t hirt y-t wo t eet h (inst ead of t he nor-
mal t hirt y-six for plat yrrhine monkeys in Sout h
America). Flat chest. Broad shoulders. Sturdy
arms. Monkeylike hands. Long fingers. Vest igial
t humbs. Oversized clit oris. Long t oes. Opposed
big t oe. No t ail.
Behavior: Can apparently walk upright by
holding on to bushes. Screams wildly. Angrily
confront s humans and uses t ree branches and it s
own excrement as weapons.
Distribution: Serrania de Parija of Colombia
and Venezuela.
Significant sighting: In 1920, members of
Swiss geologist Francois de Loys’s expedition
killed t he female of a pair of t all, t ailless apes
that appeared to threaten them. The incident
occurred along t he Rio Tarra, on t he border be-
tween Colombia and Venezuela. His famous
phot ograph shows t he dead animal sit t ing on a
DE LOYS’S APE 123
gasoline crate with its chin propped up by a
st ick. Ot her phot os were t ragically lost when de
Loys’s boat capsized. The skull was ret ained, but
t he expedit ion’s cook used it as a salt cont ainer,
and it disint egrat ed (as did t he pelt ).
Possible explanations:
(1) Thought t o be a Black spider monkey
( Ateles paniscus) by Sir Art hur Keit h, who
suspect ed t hat t he animal had been
creat ively manipulat ed for t he camera by de
Loys. However, t he report ed size alone
makes t his doubt ful, since t hese monkeys
are rarely more t han 3 feet 6 inches when
st anding on t he hind legs. No t ail is visible
in t he phot o, and t he animal’s body is
t hicker and more massive. De Loys’s ape is
less hairy, has more powerful jaws, and has
an oval face wit h lit t le prognat hism.
(2) The Whit e-bellied spider monkey (A.
belzebuth) is a st rong possibilit y, especially if
t he size of t he crat e in t he phot o is less t han
16 inches, inst ead of t he 18-20 inches
est imat ed by George Mont an don in his
analysis of t he case. Ivan Sanderson favored
t his explanat ion, suggest ing t hat t he
decomposing body had already st art ed
bloat ing when t he phot o was t aken.
(3) Loren Coleman and Michel Raynal
argue persuasively t hat t he st ory was a hoax
by Mont andon, based on de Loys’s phot o of
a spider monkey. Mont andon would have
done t his in order t o lend credence t o his
racist t heoiy t hat primat e evolut ion t ook
place independent ly in Sout h America, wit h
Indians as t he ult imat e result .
(4) An unclassified ape or monkey known
locally as t he MONO GRANDE.
(5) A surviving Protopithecus brasiliensis, a
fruit -eat ing spider monkey from t he Lat e
Pleist ocene of east ern Brazil t hat was t wice
as large as any ext ant species.

Deep-Sea Spider
Mystery INVERTEBRATE of the South Pacific
Ocean.
Physical description: Triangular fore body,
0.52 inches in length. Hind body, 2 inches
long, separated from the front by a narrow
waist . Five pairs of joint ed appendages on t he
fore body. The first pair seems to be used as
feelers. The second pair is very long and carried
high above the body. The last three pairs are
walking legs.
Significant sighting: During t he first Dist ur-
bance and Recolonizat ion Experiment in a
Manganese Nodule Area of t he Deep Sout h Pa-
cific (DISCOL) expedit ion, a scorpion-like ani-
mal was phot ographed several t imes at a dept h
of 13,616 feet in the Peru Trench on February
12, 1989.
Possible explanations:
(1) The animal was t ent at ively ident ified as
a Tailless whip scorpion (Order
Amblypygi), which it cert ainly resembles.
All ot her t ailless whip scorpions are st rict ly
t errest rial, as are modern arachnids.
However, recent discoveries have shown
t hat ancest ors of t he True scorpions (Order
Scorpiones) were once primarily aquat ic and
were equipped wit h organs called book gills,
formed of respirat ory sheet s like t he pages of
a book. These scorpions oft en grew large;
Praearcturus gigas of t he Early Devonian,
400 million years ago, was more t han 3 feet
long. Aquat ic or amphibious species
persist ed unt il at least t he end of t he
Triassic, 205 million years ago. Some
scorpions might have survived by adapt ing
t o abyssal dept hs.
(2) Sea spiders (Subphylum Pycnogonida)
are marine art hropods t hat are found from
int ert idal regions t o a dept h of 23,000 feet .
There are at least 1,000 species, but they are
lit t le known. Some deep-sea forms grow t o
more t han 2 feet across t he legs. Oft en
classed as an order wit hin t he chelicerat e
art hropods, t hey bear such unusual feat ures
(a long proboscis wit h an odd t erminal
mout h, a reduced abdomen, a pair of
ovigers for carrying eggs, long pouches in
t he int est ines t hat ext end t o t he end of t he
legs) t hat t hey probably represent a sist er
t axon t o t he Chelicerat a. The second pair of
legs of t he DISCOL spider may have been
t he ovigers.

Myst ery Bird of East Africa.
Distribution: Ruwenzori Range, Uganda.
Significant sighting: Canadian mountaineer
Earl Denman wat ched a pair of unident ifiable
birds dive swiftly and almost vertically in the

and performs spectacular aerial courtship dis-
plays. Adult s are oft en seen in pairs, diving t o-

WllDM AN of West and Cent ral Asia.
Etymology: Tajik (Persian), “demon.” The
Indo-European root dyeu - is t he basis for hot h
t he Sanskrit (Indo-Aryan) dev ah (“god”) and t he
Avestan daeva (“demon”).
Variant names: Daeva, Div, PARE.
Physical description: Height , 4 feet 10 inches.
Covered with shaggy, reddish-brown or black
hair. Black skin. Has horns, claws, fangs, and
tail.
Behavior: Bipedal. Travels either singly or in
pairs. Feeds on marmot s and ot her rodent s.
Distribution: Armenia; Northern Iran; the
Pamir Mount ains, Tajikist an.
Significant sightings: Geologist B. M. Zdorik
ran across a Dev sleeping along a pat h high in
t he upper reaches of t he Dondushkan River in
the Pamirs, Tajikistan, in 1934. Its body was
covered wit h yaklike fur. Zdorik and his guide
panicked and fled before the creature awoke.
The local people said there were families of
Devs living in t he Tafbar and Safid-Dara Val-
leys. An adult Dev had been caught in 1933 at
a flour mill a few miles from Tut kaul, where it
was kept chained up for t wo mont hs before it

Devil Bird
Myst eiy Bird of t he Indian subcont inent .
Physical description: Pigeon-sized bird t hat is
rarely seen but oft en heard. Long t ail.
Behavior: Noct urnal. Cry is a hideous, st ran-
gling sound, said t o be heard in cemet eries.
Distribution: Sri Lanka.
Significant sighting: Mitford of the Ceylon
Civil Service saw a big black bird by moonlight
at Kurunegala in t he ninet eent h cent ury. It s cry
was like a boy being t ort ured and st rangled. He
t hought it was a night jar of some t ype.
Possible explanations: None of the following
emit anyt hing like t he report ed cry of t he Devil
bird, but many are similar in shape and plumage:
(1) The Brown wood owl (Strix
leptogrammica indranee) was assumed by
Charles Pridham and James Tennent t o be
the Devil bird. It measures 14-21 inches,
and it s call is a series of t hree or four short
hoot s. Some hold it responsible for an eerie
scream.
(2) The Forest eagle owl ( Bubo nipalensis
blighi ), suggest ed by G. M. Henry. It s call
is a deep hoot , while it s mat ing calls are said
by some t o consist of shrieks like t hose of a
woman being st rangled.
(3) The Sri Lanka frogmout h
( Batrachostomus moniliger) only at t ains a
lengt h of 9 inches, and it s call consist s of
liquid chuckles or soft “karoo” or “whoo”
cries. It is shy and not oft en vocal.
(4) The Gray nightjar ( Caprimulgus indicus),
proposed by William Vincent Legge, makes
rest rained “chunk-chunk-chunk” calls.
(5) The Sri Lankan Changeable hawk-eagle
(. Spizaetus cirrhatus ceylanensis) has a ringing
scream “kleee-klee-ek,” whet her perched or
on t he wing. It also has a rapid “ki-ki-ki-ki-
ki-ki-ki-keeee,” beginning short , rising in
crescendo, and ending in a scream.
(6) The Mount ain hawk-eagle ( Spizaetus
nipalensis kelaarti ) has a noisy “klu-weet -
weet ” call.
(7) The Orient al honey buzzard ( Pernis
ptilorhynchus ruficollis) emit s loud and high-
pit ched ringing not es.
(8) A composit e bird creat ed from t he calls
of several species.
126 DEV
(9) An unknown owl. A new species of owl
is said t o have been discovered in Sri Lanka
in January 2001 by an ornit hologist who
had been t racking it s unfamiliar call for
several years.

Devil Monkey
Large, t ailed PRIMATE of Nort h America.
Etymology: Name coined by Mark A. Hall.
Variant names: Giant monkey, Naujsa
FALAYA.
Physical description: Height , 3-8 feet . Light
brown t o black hair. Point ed ears. Baboonlike
or doglike muzzle. St rong chest . A blaze of
whit e fur from neck t o belly. Short forelegs wit h
claws. Muscular hind legs. Large feet . A long t ail
is sometimes reported, alternately described as
black and bushy or hairless.
Behavior: Somet imes walks bipedally, at ot her
times quadrupedally. Aggressive toward dogs
and humans. Emit s a wide range of hoot s, calls,
screams, and whist les. Said t o kill livest ock and
small game.
Tracks: Three rounded toes, with regular
spacing bet ween. Length, 12-15 inches.
Distribution: British Columbia; Appalachian
Mount ain region of t he Unit ed St at es.
Significant sightings: Early one morning in
1959, a monkey like creat ure rushed at t he car of
a couple driving down a rural road near Salt ville,
Virginia. It chased t he vehicle for a short while,
grabbing at it with its front paws. Later, they
found three long, deep scratches in the metal
from t he front door t o t he rear. Around t he same
t ime, t he animal apparent ly ripped off t he con-
vert ible t op of a car driven by t wo nurses.
After midnight on June 26, 1997, Debbie
Cross saw a st range animal out side her rural home
near Dunkinsville, Ohio. It was 3M feet tall,
hairy, and wit h long arms and a short t ail. As it
moved away from her, it walked on it s knuckles.
A giant black monkey was spotted in rural
Danville, New Hampshire, on September 9,
2001, and on at least nine other occasions over
a t wo-week period.
Present status: Distinctions between NORTH
American Apes, Devil monkeys, Hairy Bipeds,
and BlGFOOT are nebulous and possibly arbit rary.
In general, NORTH AMERICAN APES are tailless
and primarily quadrupedal, and they resemble
chimpanzees; Devil monkeys are tailed and re-
semble baboons; HAIRY BIPEDS cover a wide
range of descript ions from apes t o wildmen and
even paranormal entities; BlGFOOT is a robust,
t all hominid wit h a range t hat seems rest rict ed t o
t he Pacific Nort hwest . Loren Coleman even
not es cert ain similarit ies wit h PHANTOM KANGA-
ROO reports and suggests that juvenile Devil
monkeys may resemble kangaroos.
Possible explanations:
(1) Feral pet monkeys have formed breeding
colonies, especially in Florida. A group of
Squirrel monkeys ( Saimiri sciureus) live in
Broward Count y’s Hugh Taylor Birch St at e
Park, and Rhesus monkeys {Macaco
mulatto) became well est ablished around
Silver Springs aft er t hey were first released
int o t he wild in Marion Count y during t he
filming of Tarzan movies in 1933. Rhesus
monkeys are also known in Jack Kaye Park
in Fort Lauderdale. A few of t he 500
monkeys uncaged in 1992 by Hurricane
Andrew from research labs, privat e owners,
and t he Miami Met rozoo are probably st ill
living and breeding in t he Everglades. Some
officials believe Capuchin monkeys ( Cebus
DEVIL MONKEY 127
spp.) are forming t roops in sout h Florida. A
free-roaming group of Japanese macaques
( Macaca fuscata ) was brought t o Dilley,
Texas, in 1972 t o save t he animals from
dest ruct ion in Kyot o, Japan, where t hey are
regarded as a nuisance; in 1980, t he
monkeys became t he propert y of t he Sout h
Texas Primat e Observat ory and were
confined for behavioral research at a ranch
t here. But in t he lat e 1980s, t heir enclosure
fell int o disrepair, and several escaped. The
monkeys have roamed t he sout h Texas
brush ever since, t heir populat ion swelling
t o more t han 600 by 1995. However, none
of t hese colonies are in areas where Devil
monkeys have been report ed.
(2) Surviving Protopithecus brasiliensis (or
relat ed species), an ext inct , fruit -eat ing
spider monkey from t he Lat e Pleist ocene of
east ern Brazil t hat was t wice as large as any
ext ant species, suggest ed by Chad Arment .
(3) Surviving Theropithecus oswaldi , a large
baboon t hat lived 650,000 years ago in East
Africa and is t he ancest or of t he modern
Gelada baboon ( T. gelada ), suggest ed by
Mark A. Hall. The male was roughly t he
size of a female gorilla and weighed 250
pounds. A ground dweller, t his animal was
t oo big t o live in t rees and could not use it s
long forearms for swinging.

Devil Pig
Large, piglike HOOFED MAMMAL or MARSUPIAL
of Aust ralasia.
Variant names: Gazeka, Monckt on’s gazeka.
Physical description: Dark skin wit h pat t erned
markings. Lengt h, 5 feet . Shoulder height , 3
feet 6 inches or great er. Long snout . Horselike
t ail. Even-t oed (cloven) feet .
Distribution: Owen Stanley Range, Papua
New Guinea.
Significant sightings: Ancient stone carvings
depicting strange animals with long, trunklike
snouts were first found in 1962 in the Ambun
Valley.
Huge (rhinoceros-sized) excrement was
found by t he crew of t he HMS Basilisk on t he
northeast Papuan coast in the 1870s. Dung
from feral pigs, which are t he largest Papuan un-
gulat es, is less subst ant ial.
Two nat ive Papuans, Privat e Ogi and t he vil-
lage const able Oina, saw t wo large, porcine ani-
mals on Mount Albert Edward, Papua New
Guinea, on May 10, 1906. Ogi tried to shoot
one, but his hands shook, and he misfired.
Possible explanations:
(1) A feral Domest ic pig ( Sus scrofa var.
domesticus) is rarely larger t han 2 feet 6
inches at t he shoulder.
(2) The Malayan t apir ( Tapirus indicus) is

Devil’s Hoofmarks
Tracks made by a myst ery mammal, possibly a
RODENT, in England and elsewhere.
Etymology: Newspapers in 1855 report ed t hat
some people at t ribut ed t he marks t o Sat an.
Tracks: Vaguely donkeylike; some appear t o
have been made by hooves, while ot hers do not .
Length, 3.5-4 inches. Width, 1.5-2.75 inches.
Depth, 0.5-4 inches. The prints are 8-16
inches apart and direct ly in front of each ot her,
rat her t han alt ernat ing left and right .
Significant sightings: On t he night of February
8-9, 1855, somet hing left a t rail of t housands of
print s in t he snow across Devon, England, from
Torquay in the south to Exeter in the north.
The tracks wandered through gardens, lanes,
and cemet eries in at least t hirt y villages, crossing
roofs and jumping across walls and hayst acks.
Several groups of people followed t hem, but all
failed to find a track maker, to note whether
t here was more t han one t rail, or t o det ermine if
t he print s varied in shape from place t o place.
Other cases of mysterious trails that have
been compared to the Devon case include
cloven tracks in the snow found in Inverness,
Scot land, t he same mont h, which a local nat u-
ralist declared were made eit her by a hare or by
a European polecat {Mustela putorius); t he don-
keylike tracks discovered by the crew of James
Clark Ross in May 1 840 on desolat e Kerguelen
Island in the South Indian Ocean, which may
have been made by an animal cast ashore on a
shipwrecked vessel; t he 2-mile-long set of semi-
circular t racks found in t he snow on January 10,
1945, near Everberg, Belgium, by Eric Frank
Russell that were 9-12 inches apart; the hoof-
marks clearly impressed in t he wet sand of a De-
vonshire coast al t own t hat were found by a Mr.
Wilson in October 1950; and small, horseshoe-
shaped tracks in the snow photographed by
Ruth Christiansen in January 1975 at Frederic,
Wisconsin.
Possible explanations:
(1) Many wild guesses were made, including
an escaped monkey, mouse, rat , swan, hare,
deer, ot t er, t oad, Domest ic cat ( Felis
silvestris catus ), escaped kangaroo, heron,
and a Great bust ard ( Otis tarda).
(2) Zoologist Richard Owen suggest ed t he
t racks were made by Eurasian badgers
( Meles meles) out looking for food on t his
part icularly cold night . However, badger
print s overlap and clearly alt ernat e left and
right .
(3) Birds may have easily left t racks in
closed gardens or on t op of walls, but bird
print s, whet her clawed or webbed, are easily
recognizable.
(4) The Donkey ( Equus asinus) does act ually
place it s hooves in a st raight line when
walking and could have account ed for some
of t he t racks.
(5) The Red fox ( Vulpes vulpes) may have
cont ribut ed t o t he myst ery, according t o
Gordon St ein, but it would have had a
difficult t ime scaling walls or roofs.
(6) The Wood mouse ( Apodemus sylvaticus)
makes a V-shaped t rack when it moves
along in kangaroo-like leaps of 2-3 feet ,
climbing bushes and t rees wit h ease. It is
quit e common in English gardens. Alfred
Leut scher t hought of t his explanat ion when
he came across dozens of t rails made by t his
mouse in t he snow, all four feet coming
t oget her in a single t rack roughly
conforming t o t he hoofmarks.
(7) Manfri Wood recount ed a t ale he heard
about a carefully planned prank by Romanies
using several hundred pairs of specially made
st ilt s in an at t empt t o scare away t heir rivals,
t he Didikais (Romanies of mixed herit age)
and Pikies (criminals expelled from Romany
society). The scheme depended on making
DEVIL’S HOOFMARKS 129

t he t racks appear supernat ural. However, t he
event t ook place in Somerset at an
unspecified t ime in t he past and involved size
27 boot s at t he base of t he st ilt s.
(8) James Alan Rennie proposed t hat t he
t racks were made by freakish air current s, an
int erest ing suggest ion in t he light of similar
explanat ions for t he crop circles of sout hern
on the night of February 8-9, 1855, in Devon, En-
England. He claimed t o have seen a line of
much larger t racks being made in such a
fashion in t he snow in nort hern Canada in
1924.
(9) Morris K. Jessup and George Lyall
suggest ed t hat unident ified flying object s
(UFOs) sent down “rays” or laser beams t o
creat e t he t racks.
130 DEVIL’S HOOFMARKS
(10) Mike Dash has discovered that some
apparent anomalies in this case have been
overstated: There were multiple trails of
varying lengths, not a continuous one of 1 00
miles, as one account had it. Several sources
suggest that tracks were found for several
days afterward. One report that the tracks led
to a haystack with no marks in the snow on
its surface and reappeared on the opposite
side is difficult to explain, but the source was
anonymous and secondhand. Some witnesses
saw claw marks or rounded prints, while
others found clearly defined hoofmarks. Also,
in some instances the tracks were not strictly
one in front of the other. All of this indicates
multiple causes for the tracks.

brown or black hair or fur. Thickset, powerful
build. Receding forehead. Heavy brows. Large
eyes. Big-lobed ears. Flared nostrils. High
cheekbones. Thick lips. Jutting jaw. Opposable

Konawaruk Mountains, Guyana, in 1910. They
were covered in reddish-brown hair.
DIDI 131
A guide named Miegam was traveling up the
Berbice River in Guyana in 1918 with three
others when they saw two hairy creatures on the
riverbank. The creatures’ footprints looked ape-
like rather than human.
Mycologist Gary Samuels observed a 5-foot-
tall Didi about 60 feet away in the Guyanese
forest in 1987. It walked past on two feet, mak-
ing an occasional “hoo” sound.

Dimorphic Beaked Whale
Unclassified CETACEAN of the eastern Pacific
Ocean.
Etymology: From its two distinct color forms.
Scientific name: Mesoplodon species A.
Variant name: Unidentified beaked whale.
Physical description: Length, 16-18 feet.
Long, wide beak. Relatively flat head with a
small but distinct melon. Low, triangular dorsal
fin. Males have a broad, white swath across the
body; the head and beak are reddish-brown or
tan, while the back and flanks behind the swath
are black-brown or chocolate-brown. Females
and young are gray-brown, fading to pale gray
on the underside.
Behavior: Usually seen traveling in tight
groups at a moderate pace. Feeds on squid.
132 DIENTUDO
Distribution: Eastern Pacific Ocean from cen-
tral Mexico to Peru. Favors deep water.
Significant sightings : Known from about sixty-
five sketchy sightings at sea, as well as a series of
aerial photographs taken by a helicopter in No-
vember 1999.
Present status: Classification is pending, until
a stranded specimen can be examined.
Possible explanations:
(1) This animal is assumed to be an
unknown species of beaked whale.
(2) Longman’s beaked whale ( Indopacetus
pacificus) is known only from two skulls;
there have been no live observations.
(3) Bahamonde’s beaked whale (. Mesoplodon
bahamondi ) is known from a single skull.
(4) The Lesser beaked whale (. Mesoplodon
peruvianas) was officially described in 1991
after a male specimen was found on a
deserted beach north of Lima, Peru. Its
range overlaps with the Dimorphic, but it
has been thought to be smaller, at 11-12
feet long. Robert Pitman and Morgan Lynn
consider that it is a good match and that
Dimorphic sizes have been overestimated.

Dingonek
WvTER Lion of East Africa.
Etymology: Masai and Okiek (Nilo-Saharan)
word.
Variant names: Ndamathia (Kikuyu/Bantu),
Ol-maima, Ol-umaina (Masai/Nilo-Saharan).
Physical description: Length, 14-18 feet. Spot-
ted like a leopard. Covered with scales. Head
like an otter’s or a lioness’s. Small ears. Two
straight, white tusks in the upper jaw. Short
neck. Back is as broad as a hippo’s. Short legs.
Claws. Long, broad tail.
Behavior: Basks on logs or on riverbanks.
Slips in the water when disturbed. Swims with
only its head above the water.
Tracks: As big as a hippo’s. Clawed.
Distribution: Rivers in Kenya and Tanzania
that feed into the east side of Lake Victoria; the
Kikira River, a source of the Tana River, Kenya.
Significant sightings: In 1907, big-game
hunter John Alfred Jordan took a shot at an an-
imal with leopard’s spots and two large fangs
along the Migori River, where it flows into Lake
Victoria, Kenya. He also found clawed tracks
the size of a hippo’s.
Around the same time, a man known to C.
W. Hobley saw a large animal floating on a log
in the Mara River on the border between Kenya
and Tanzania. It was spotted like a leopard, cov-
ered with scales, had a head like an otter’s, and
was about 16 feet long.
Possible explanation: A surviving saber-
toothed cat, suggested by Bernard Heuvelmans.
The scales might be explained by clumps of wet,
shiny, matted fur.

DINOSAURS (Living)
Until the 1980s, there was ongoing controversy
(occasionally reflected in cryptozoological litera-
ture) over whether dinosaurs had a single ances-
tor or many different ones. In the current view,
it appears that Richard Owen had it right in
DINOSAURS 133
1842 when he invented the name Dinosauria
(“terrible reptiles”), based only on three known
fossil genera that he thought had one common
ancestor. The defining characteristic of the Di-
nosauria is now considered to be (along with a
few other minor skeletal characteristics of the
femur, humerus, ankle, and foot) a ball-and-
socket joint at the hip, like the mammals, that
supports the body weight and allows for an
erect, bipedal gait in certain types. As a group,
they flourished for 160 million years, from the
Late Triassic to the end of the Cretaceous
(225—65 million years ago). The most primitive
dinosaur yet found is the 3-foot-long Eoraptor,
discovered in northwestern Argentina in 1991.
Not all huge fossil reptiles were dinosaurs.
The flying pterosaurs, the marine plesiosaurs
and mosasaurs, the diapsids Tanystropheus and
Champsosaurus , the mammal-like therapsids —
none of these are classed with the dinosaurs.
The Superorder Dinosauria is subdivided
into two orders, the Saurischia and the
Ornithischia.
The Saurischia included carnivorous, bipedal
therapods such as Tyrannosaurus and the herbiv-
orous, long-necked sauropodomorphs such as
Apatosaurus. They had in common elongated
necks, long second fingers, and skeletal cavities
housing air-filled sacs connected to the lungs. It
was this type of dinosaur that survived extinction
at the end of the Cretaceous in the form of Bl EDS.
The Ornithischia included dome-headed and
horned cerapods (such as Iguanodon and Tricer-
atops) and the armored thyreophorans (such as
Stegosaurus and Ankylosaurus) . They shared key
characteristics of the jaws and teeth that enabled
them to chew plants efficiently.
Giganotosaurus may have been the largest car-
nivorous animal that ever lived on land. A
theropod dinosaur from the Early Cretaceous of
Argentina that was first described in 1995, it
was at least 42 feet from nose to tail tip. Verte-
brae from a related species yet unnamed that
was discovered in Patagonia in 2000 indicate an
even greater length of 45 feet. The largest
Tyrannosaurus rex was only 40 feet long.
At 110-120 feet, the herbivorous sauropod
Seismosaurus of the Late Jurassic of New Mexico
is the longest land vertebrate yet discovered,
weighing in at 33 tons. Its tail alone was about
50 feet, and its head and neck were nearly that
length. The Cretaceous sauropod Argenti-
nosaurus of Patagonia may also have attained
this size, though it is only known from vertebrae
and limb bones. In late 1999, some vertebrae
from a possibly even larger sauropod were dis-
covered in southern Patagonia; preliminary esti-
mates gave it a length of 167 feet.
Different species of dinosaurs went extinct
throughout the Mesozoic, not just at the end of
the Cretaceous. For example, more time elapsed
between the death of the last Stegosaurus and the
hatching of the first Tyrannosaurus than be-
tween the extinction of the last dinosaur and the
birth of the first modern human.
There is no unambiguous evidence for di-
nosaur fossils after the Cretaceous-Tertiary
boundary. Dinosaur teeth mixed with mam-
malian bones in Paleocene deposits have been
found in the Hell Creek Formation in Mon-
tana, but it’s not clear whether they had origi-
nally come from earlier, dinosaur-bearing levels.
Redeposition of older fossils into younger sedi-
ments by rivers or streams is not uncommon.
Surviving dinosaurs are not a zoological im-
possibility, especially in areas that have been ge-
ologically stable for the past 60 million years
(such as Africa). Large dinosaurs that are cold-
blooded (ectothermic) would have a better time
surviving in hot, equatorial regions than warm-
blooded (endothermic) animals with high meta-
bolic rates. Ectotherms also require only 10 per-
cent of the amount of food taken in by full
endotherms. However, determining dinosaur
energetics and thermal biology without living
models is, at best, a speculative endeavor.
The two major types of African dinosaur in
this section are the MOKEIE-MBEMBE, which
might be a surviving sauropod, and the EMEIA-
N 1CUKA, which some think might be a ceratop-
sian survivor such as Monoclonius. Both are
known by many different local names. The oth-
ers in the list are much less documented.

South American dinosaurs: A few rumors of
huge, amphibious beasts in South America are
on record, but no local Indian names have sur-
faced.
In 1882, an odd, 40-foot saurian was killed
on the Rio Beni, El Beni Department, Bolivia.
It was said to have two additional, doglike heads
sprouting from its back, a long neck, and scaly
armor. “A Bolivian Saurian,” Scientific American
49 (1883): 3.
The explorer Percy Fawcett mentioned di-
nosaur-like animals briefly on several occasions
as occurring in the Rio Guapore area on the
border of Bolivia and Brazil, in the Madidi re-
gion of La Paz Department in northwestern Bo-
livia, and in swamps around the Rio Acre in
Acre State, Brazil. Percy H. Fawcett, Exploration
Fawcett (London: Hutchinson, 1955).
In late 1907, Franz Herrmann Schmidt and
Rudolph Pfleng allegedly encountered an
aquatic, dinosaur-like monster, 35 feet long, in
a swampy area in the forested swamps of Loreto
Department, Peru. It had a tapirlike head “the
size of a beer keg,” a snakelike neck, and heavy,
clawed flippers. Their bullets seemed to have no
effect on the animal. Franz Herrmann Schmidt,
“Prehistoric Monsters in Jungles of the Ama-
zon.” New York Herald, January 11, 1911.
In 1931, Swedish explorer Harald Westin saw
a 20-foot lizard walking along the shore of the
Rio Mamore on the border of Brazil and Bo-
livia. It had an alligator-like head, four legs, and
a body like a distended boa constrictor. Harald
Westin, Tjugu ars djungel - och tropikliv (Stock-
holm: Bonnier, 1933).
Leonard Clark heard rumors of an animal re-
sembling a sauropod dinosaur from Peruvian
Indians around the Rio Maranon, Peru, in
1946. Leonard Clark, The Rivers Ran East (New
York: Funk and Wagnalls, 1953).
In 1975, a Swiss businessman hired a seventy-
five-year-old guide named Sebastian Bastos,
who told him that the Amazonian Indians knew
of animals 1 8 feet long that overturn canoes and
kill humans. Bastos himself had survived an at-
tack several years earlier. Liverpool Daily Post,
January 3, 1976.
Artifacts:
A gold figurine from Ashanti Province in
Ghana, West Africa, and now located at the
University of Pennsylvania Museum seems to
depict a sauropod dinosaur. It was made as a
trademark representing a particular family of
gold dealers and resembles an Apatosaurus
(bulky body, four legs, long tail), except for a
relatively large head that looks more like a
Tyrannosaurus. Some researchers see it as a rep-
resentation of the M ok fir- Mr fm b r. Margaret

In October and November 1924, an expedi-
tion led by archaeologist Samuel Hubbard and
paleontologist Charles W. Gilmore explored the
Havasu Canyon area on the Havasupai Indian
Reservation west of the Grand Canyon in
northern Arizona. Near where the Tobocobe
Trail intersects Lee Canyon, they discovered
pictographs on the red sandstone along the trail,
one of which seems to show a bipedal ornitho-
pod dinosaur. Oakland Museum, Discoveries

In July 1944, German merchant Waldemar
Julsrud discovered a cache of clay and stone fig-
urines depicting dinosaurs, weird animals, hu-
mans, masks, and vessels on El Toro hill near
Acambaro, Guanajuato State, Mexico. By the
mid-1950s, he had found some 33,500 separate
objects, which filled his twelve-room mansion
and, it is said, forced him to sleep in the bath-
tub. The collection is no longer open to the
public, and it is suspected that only a fraction of
the original number of objects exist now.
Though apparently seven distinct artistic styles
are represented in the collection, none are typi-
cal of artifacts found elsewhere in Mesoamerica.
Most, if not all, of the dinosaur-like figures are
fanciful or composite animals, though some
DINOSAURS 135
have seen resemblances to the sauropod Bra-
chiosaurus, the ornithopod Iguanodon , and an
Ankylosaurus. Other figures resemble such ex-
tinct Pleistocene fauna as CAMEIOPS. Radiocar-
bon dates for the artifacts range from
4530-1110 B.C., though in some cases, labora-
tories have retracted these findings upon learn-
ing of their controversial nature, referring to
suspected contamination or even “regenerated
light signals.” William N. Russell, “Did Man

In 1966, Peruvian physician Javier Cabrera ob-
tained a rock on which was a picture of a fish,
seemingly carved thousands of years ago. He
found where it came from and eventually amassed
a collection of thousands of volcanic rocks with
pictures of dinosaurs, kangaroos, mastodons,
winged humanoids, telescopes, open-heart sur-
gery, and other fantastic images. Now housed in
his Museo de Piedras Grabadas in Ocucaje, near
lea, Peru, Cabrera claims they were made 1 mil-
lion-250,000 years ago by an unknown culture.
Others have accused Cabrera of producing the
stones himself or at least turning a blind eye to
local forgers. Ryan Drum, “The Cabrera Rocks,”

Djinni
Lithe Peop le of Southeast Asia.
Etymology: Arabic (Semitic), possibly a bor-
rowing from the Latin genius (“guardian spirit
of a man or place”). Plural, Djinn.
Variant names: Cin (Turkish), Djihin, Djin
(Djinniyah for the female), Genie (English),
Jann (in Iran), Jinni.
Physical description: Body is composed of
vapor or smokeless flame. In Malay folklore,
Djinni is used as a polite equivalent for an evil
spirit ( hantu ).
Behavior: Nocturnal. Intelligent. Capable of
appearing in different forms, including a black
cat, goat, BLACK Dog, duck, hen, buffalo, fox,
snake, or human.
Habitat: Ruined houses, cisterns, rivers, wells,
crossroads, markets.
Distribution: Malaysia; Indonesia; Iran; else-
where in the Islamic world.
Possible explanations:
(1) In pre-Islamic Arabia, Djinn were
elemental nymphs and spirits of the desert.
(2) In Islamic metaphysics, Djinn are
supernatural beings.
(3) In popular culture, Djinni is a general
folkloric name for many types of indigenous
spirits.

Dobharchu
A large O TIERlike animal of Ireland that may be
responsible for some PEIST legends or sightings
of Freshwaier Monsters.
Etymology: Irish, “otter,” though in County
Leitrim, the word is said to connote a mythical
“king otter.” The Irish word madra usice (“water
hound”) is more commonly used for the Euro-
pean otter.
Variant names: Anchu, Dhuraghoo, Dor-
raghow, Doyarchu, King otter, Master otter,
Water hound.
Physical description: Like an otter but said to
136 DJINNI
be about five times as large (perhaps 10-15
feet). White pelt. Black ear tips. Black cross on
its back.
Behavior: Aggressive and dangerous. Call is a
whistling sound. Can break a rock with its
snout.
Distribution: County Leitrim, Ireland.
Significant sighting: Grace (or Grainne) Con-
nolly is said to have been killed by a Dobharchu
as she washed her clothes in Glenade Lough,
County Leitrim, on September 24, 1722. A
gravestone in Conwall Cemetery south of Kin-
lough portrays the creature as doglike, with a
long tail, large paws, long neck, and short head.
Possible explanation: The European otter
C Lutra lutrd) can grow to a length of 4 feet 6
inches, including the tail. However, it is not
particularly aggressive toward humans. For-
merly common throughout Europe (including
Ireland), it has been virtually eliminated
through much of its range since the 1950s.

Dobsegna
Doglike animal of Australasia that resembles a
THYLACINE.
Etymology: Dani (Papuan) word.
Physical description: Light-brown fur. Strong
mouth. Huge jaws. Head and shoulders like a
dog. Stripes on the rear portion of its body.
Thin tail nearly as long as its body.
Behavior: Nocturnal. Hunts in packs at dawn
or dusk. Feeds on small marsupials, pigs, chick-
ens, and birds.
Habitat: Caves and rocky areas in the high-
lands.
Distribution: Baliem Valley, the central
mountains around Wamena, and the Gunung
Lorentz National Park of Irian Jaya, Indonesia;
Mount Giluwe, Papua New Guinea.
Significant sightings: In 1993, Ned Terry in-
vestigated reports that a Thylacine-like animal
existed in the Baliem Valley; the local Dani peo-
ple identified his photos of a Thylacine as the
Dobsegna.
In March 1997, a supposed Thylacine at-
tacked villagers’ livestock in the Jayawijaya Dis-
trict of Irian Jaya.
Possible explanation: Surviving THYLACINE,
which lived in New Guinea during the Pleis-
tocene.

Dodo
Flightless BlKD of the Solitaire family (Raphidae),
thought extinct in Mauritius since at least 1690.
Etymology: From the Portuguese doudo
(“fool” or “simpleton”).
Scientific name: Raphus cucullatus, given by
Carl von Linne in 1758.
Variant name: Dronte.
Physical description: Based on seventeenth-
century accounts, this bulky bird had grayish
plumage with whitish tail feathers. Length,
about 3 feet 3 inches. Long, featherless, hooked
beak. Its rudimentary wings were incapable of
flight. Four toes, instead of the usual three.
Behavior: Clumsy. When running to escape
capture, its body wobbled and its belly scraped
the ground.
Distribution: Mauritius, in the Indian Ocean.
Significant sightings: Natives of Mauritius told
Lawrence G. Green in the 1930s that Dodos
still existed in caves and mountains on remote
parts of the island.
Reports of Dodolike birds walking at dusk
along the beach in the Plain Champagne area
turned up in the early 1990s, enough to con-

lections of Northwestern University Library)
vince William J. Gibbons to mount an expedi-
tion to the island in 1997.
Present status: The last known sighting of a
living Dodo was in 1662 by Volquard Iverson.
Possible explanations:
(1) Surviving Dodo, though this is
extremely unlikely.
(2) Surviving unknown species of Solitaire
(Raphidae) related to the Dodo.
(3) A Southern giant petrel ( Macronectes
giganteus ), which averages 37 inches in
length.
(4) Observations after 1 662 may be the
Mauritius red hen (Aphanapteryx bonasia ),
which was called the Dodo after the original
bird was extinct.

Doglas
Unrecognized big CAT hybrid of the Indian
subcontinent.
Etymology: Unknown; possibly Hindi (Indo-
Aryan), “double-faced.”
Physical description: Length, 8 feet. Spotted,
leopardlike head. Tigerlike neck ruff. Shoulders
and body covered with tiger stripes that some-
times blur into rosettes. Grayish ground color.
Leopardlike tail.
Distribution: India.
Significant sighting: An apparent leopard x
tiger hybrid was killed by Frederick C. Hicks in
1910, who claimed that the locals were familiar
with these animals.
138 DOGLAS
Possible explanation: An interspecies Leopard
(Panthera pardus) x Tiger (P. tigris) cross is un-
known in the wild, but if it occurred, it would
probably result in a sterile animal.

DOGS (Unknown)
The Dog family (Canidae) arose from primitive
carnivores in the Eocene, about 35 million years
ago, in North America. Common characteristics
include elongated jaws, long legs relative to body
size, five toes on the front feet and four toes on
the hind feet, nonretractile claws, and an omniv-
orous diet. Most species are uniform in col-
oration, with special markings usually confined
to the head and the tip of the tail. In size, canids
range from the Fennec fox ( Fennecus zerda ) that
weighs about 3 pounds to the Gray wolf ( Canis
lupus) that weighs up to 175 pounds.
The earliest canids were the hesperocyonines
of North America, small- to medium-sized
predators of the Late Eocene, 35 million years
ago. They were replaced by the borophagines, a
group that ranged in size from foxes to lions and
was dominant from the Miocene through the
Pleistocene, 25-1.5 million years ago. An early
true dog ( Canis davisi) moved across the Bering
land bridge to Asia and Europe in the Miocene.
About the size of a coyote, it ultimately gave rise
to the foxes and wolves that colonized all of
Eurasia. From 2 million to 700,000 years ago,
wolves, coyotes, and foxes moved back into
North America from Asia. All domestic dog
breeds are descended from the gray wolf, which
was apparently domesticated at different times
and places as early as 12,000 years ago.
Of the twenty canids in this list, only a hand-
ful could represent new or surviving species
(perhaps the HUNGARIAN Reedwolf or the Wv-
HEELA); most will likely turn out to be color
morphs, deformed individuals, or misidentifica-
tions of known animals. Some, such as the
Auen Big Dog or the Phantom Wol? are un-
doubtedly multicausal.

Doko
Sm AIL Hom inid of East Africa.
Etymology: Swahili (Bantu), “small.” Similar
to the ancient Egyptian Dongo; see PYGMY
(CLASSICAL). In some places, it has the meaning
“ignorant or stupid.”
Physical description: Height, 4 feet. Olive-
bronze skin. Straight head-hair. Flat nose. Small
eyes. Thick lips.
Behavior: Eats fruit, roots, mice, snakes, ants,
and honey. Worships a superior being called
Yer. Taken as a slave by neighboring tribes.
Distribution: East of Lake Turkana, Kenya.
Present status: Possibly corresponds with one
of the Kenyan cryptids, designated as hominid
X5, described by Jacqueline Roumeguere-Eber-
hardt in 1990.

Domenech’s Pseudo-Goat
An odd, goatlike HOOFED Mam M ALseen once in
Texas.
Physical description: Size of a cat. White,
glossy fur. Rose-colored, goatlike horns. Claws
instead of hooves.
Distribution: Central Texas.
Significant sighting: Around 1850 in Freder-
icksburg, Texas, the French missionary Em-
manuel Domenech talked to an American offi-
DOMENECH’S PSEUDO-GOAT 139
cer who told him that a Comanche woman kept
one of these animals and that they were found
wild in the woods.
Possible explanation: If described accurately, a
taxonomic anomaly. An unusual array of ungu-
late mammals evolved in the Cenozoic of South
America, which was an island during much of
that era. Among them was a family of notoungu-
lates known as homalodotheriids, robust forest
browsers with clawlike toes instead of hooves that
lived in Argentina until about 9 million years ago.
None of them, however, had true horns; only the
distantly related toxodonts developed dermal
horns like those of rhinos. The combination of
horns and claws makes it nearly impossible to
find a match for this animal in the fossil record.

Dorsal Finner
A category of Sea MONSTER identified by Gary
Mangiacopra.
Physical description: Length, 70-100 feet. Di-
ameter, 9-15 feet. Smooth skin, with occasional
scales or warts. Dull green to dark brown in
color. Yellow, shading to lighter, on the under-
side. Froglike or alligator-shaped head, 15 feet
long. Large green or red eyes. Jaw, 5 feet long,
with 6-inch-long teeth. Round neck. One pair
of frontal flippers. Large fin standing straight up
on the back.
Behavior: Swims rapidly by vertical undula-
tions. Churns up the water. Possibly attracted to
ships.
Distribution: Atlantic coast of the United
States.
Significant sighting: Captain Delory of the
sloop Mary Lane sighted a huge, alligator-like
head sticking out of the water southwest of
Point Judith, Rhode Island, on August 4, 1888.
He estimated its length as 70 feet as it passed
close by, its bright green scales glistening.
Present status: Mangiacopra identified five
sightings from 1878 to 1888, then seems to
have dropped this category.
Possible explanation: Some type of unknown
whale.

Double-Banded Argus
Mystery Bird of Southeast Asia.
Scientific name: Argusianus bipunctatus, pro-
posed by T. W. Wood in 1871. Placed in the
same genus as the Great argus of Indonesia.
Physical description: Has two reddish-brown
bands with white dots on its primary feather, in-
stead of one band.
Distribution: Java in Indonesia or Tioman Is-
land, Johor State, Malaysia.
Significant sighting: Pheasant of uncertain ori-
gin, known from a single feather in the British
Museum of Natural History.
Possible explanations:
(1) Surviving fossil pheasant of some type.
(2) An aberrant form of the Great argus
[Argusianus argus) which lives in peninsular
Malaysia and Sumatra and Borneo in
Indonesia.

Dover Demon
Bizarre humanoid ENTITY of Massachusetts.
Etymology: Name given by Loren Coleman
and picked up by local newspapers.
Physical description: Height, 3 feet 6 inches-4
feet. Hairless, peach-colored, sandpapery skin.
Large, watermelon-shaped head. Eyes, orange or
green, shining, round, and lidless. No nose,
140 DORSAL FINNER

ears, or mouth. Thin neck. Spindly arms and
legs. Long fingers and hands.
Behavior: Bipedal.
Distribution: Dover, Massachusetts.
Significant sightings: At 10:30 PM. on April
21, 1977, Bill Bartlett was driving through
Dover, Massachusetts, with two friends when
he saw a strange, thin creature with glowing eyes
and a large head crawling along some rocks on
the far side of the road. It was visible only for a
few seconds, but it terrified Bartlett. Over the
next twenty-four hours, there were two other
sightings by local teens: About two hours later,
John Baxter saw a humanoid creature run away
from him down a wooded gully, and Will Tain-
tor and Abby Brabham spotted an orange-eyed,
monkeylike apparition crouching on all fours
on the night of April 22.
DOVER DEMON 141
Possible explanations:
(1) A hoax by the teenagers, though the
initial investigators (Loren Coleman and
Walter Webb) thought the youngsters were
sincere.
(2) An escaped laboratory monkey, though
none was reported lost.
(3) A Red fox ( Vulpes fulva) that had lost its
hair due to sarcoptic mange.
(4) A newborn horse.
(5) A yearling Moose ( Alces alces ), suggested
by Martin Kottmeyer. There is a permanent
breeding population of 200-300 moose in
Massachusetts, mostly west of the
Connecticut River, though some have
wandered close to Boston. In 1996, a young
moose cow crashed through some fences
around row houses near Boston College. A
calf would make an unexpected sight in the
darkness; however, some of the
characteristics do not match, and moose
were not as populous in 1 977 as they are
now.
(6) A Merb EING, according to Mark A.
Hall, though it was seen in the woods.
(7) A paranormal apparition or unidentified
flying object (UFO) entity.

Dragon (Asian)
SEMIMYTHICAL Beast of East Asia. One of the
four sacred animals of Chinese mythology.
Variant names: Chen (Mandarin
Chinese/Sino-Tibetan), Chi lung (“wingless
dragon”), Chi’ih, Fei-yu, Fu-ts’ang lung (“treas-
ure dragon”), Jiao lung (“scaly dragon”), Kiao
lung, Kioh lung, Kura-mitsu-ha (Japanese,
“dark water snake”), Kura-okami (Japanese,
“dragon god of the valleys”), Kura-yama-sumi
(Japanese, “lord of the dark mountains”), Long,
Long-ma (Vietnamese), Lung (“five-clawed
dragon”), Lung wang (“dragon king”), Mang
(“four-clawed dragon”), Naga, Qiu lung
(“horned dragon”), Riong (Korean/Altaic), Riu
(Japanese), Shen lung (“spiritual dragon”), T’ao
t’ieh (“glutton”), Tatsu (Japanese), Ti lung
(“river dragon”), T’ien lung (“celestial dragon”),
Ying lung (“winged dragon”), Yu lung (“fish
dragon”).
Physical description: A huge body with both
serpentine and crocodilian characteristics. Has
117 fishlike scales. Straight horns like a deer’s,
through which it can hear. Flat, long head like a
camel’s. Has a bladderlike swelling on the top of
its head. Bearded. Eyes like a rabbit’s. Ears like
a cow’s. Tongue and neck like a snake’s. The
male has a luminous pearl concealed under its
chin by a fold of skin. Long mane. Wings seen
only in mature specimens. Belly like a frog’s.
Four feet, with claws like a hawk’s. Footpads
like a tiger’s. Chinese dragons have four or five
toes; Japanese dragons only have three.
Behavior: Can fly without wings. Has the
ability to change forms. Sometimes guards trea-
sure. Lays a brightly colored, gemlike egg. Said
to have a 3,000-year growth cycle in which it
first looks like a water snake, grows a carp’s head
and scales, develops four limbs and a long tail,
sprouts a pair of horns, and finally grows wings.
A benevolent creature symbolizing authority,
strength, experience, wisdom, and goodness.
Originally the Chinese rain god, the Dragon
was associated with the Chinese emperor, ances-
tor worship, fertility, and pools.
Habitat: Wells, rivers, lakes (in China); the
ocean (in Japan).
Distribution: China; Japan; Korea; Indonesia.
Significant sightings: The oldest known image
of a Chinese dragon is a rock painting dating
from 8000 B.G that was found in 1993 on a cliff
in southwestern Shanxi Province.
In the fourth millennium B.G, a Dragon de-
livered the eight mystic triagrams, Hae Pa Kua,
to a legendary emperor.
The Northern Song emperor Huizong in A. D.
1110 classified all Dragons into five families —
Blue Spirit Dragons, very compassionate kings;
Red Spirit Dragons, the kings of lakes; Yellow
Spirit Dragons, kings who receive vows favor-
ably; White Spirit Dragons, virtuous and pure
142 DRAGON (ASIAN)
Dragon sculpture in the Botanical Gardens, Saigon, Vietnam, 1930s. (From a postcard in the author’s collection)
kings; and Black Spirit Dragons, the kings of
mysterious lakes.
Another official classification of Dragons di-
vided them into Spirit Dragons that fly into
heaven and Earthly Dragons that protect trea-
sure or hide in the earth.
The Russian monk Elder Barsanuphius served
with a nursing detachment during the Russo-
Japanese War. Some Chinese soldiers told him
that in 1902, when they were stationed at a post
in the mountains 40 miles from Muling, Hei-
longjiang Province, they saw a winged Dragon
creep out from a cave on several occasions.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Chinese alligator [Alligator sinensis)
may have been the prototype for the
legendary Dragon, according to Richard
Carrington. Now restricted to the lower
Yangtze River Valley in Anui Province,
China, it may have had a much wider range
in eastern China in historical times. It
prefers slow-moving, freshwater rivers,
streams, and swamps. Reports of
individuals 9 feet long exist in Chinese
historical records, but today, the animal
does not exceed 6 feet. It is the most
endangered of all crocodilians, thanks to
rampant habitat destruction. Chinese
apothecaries have traditionally sold dried
alligator parts as remedies derived from
Dragons.
(2) Sea Monsters seen sometimes in the Gulf
of Tonkin would be regarded as Dragons.
(3) Dinosaur fossils in numerous areas of
China and Mongolia have probably
contributed to Dragon mythology. Chinese
Dragon eggs in apothecary shops often
turned out to be dinosaur or fossil ostrich
eggs from Mongolia.
(4) Some Dragon legends may have been
inspired by fossil elephants or mammoths.
(5) Monitor lizards, especially the Komodo
dragon [Varanus komodoensis ), found in
Indonesia, which grows to 1 0 feet 6 inches
long, may have inspired Dragon mythology.
The largest known monitor was Megalania
prisca, a 15- to 21 -foot lizard that lived in
central Australia in the Pliocene and
Pleistocene (2 million-20,000 years ago).
Other monitor species currently unknown
to science may also have contributed to
Dragon lore.
DRAGON (ASIAN) 143
(6) Carl Sagan suggested that Dragon
legends may stem from primal memories of
dinosaurs passed on to us from our
mammalian ancestors who were their
contemporaries.

Significant sightings: St. George (a knight of
Cappadocia in Turkey) was said to have killed a
Dragon in a pond near Silene (possibly Shahhat
or Suluntah in Cyrenaica or Zlitan in Tripoli ta-
nia), Libya. The citizens of the town were sacri-
ficing teenage girls to the monster in order to
keep it from killing everyone and devastating
the countryside. When it was the turn of the
king’s daughter, an itinerant knight named
George stuck the Dragon with his lance. The
girl then led it through the town where George
killed it. Afterward, the townsfolk became
Christian. The legend may have originated in
sixth-century North African folktales or in the
Caucasus Mountains of Georgia, but St. George
was adopted as an Anglo-Saxon Christian hero
in England. The tale circulated widely during
the Middle Ages, eventually becoming a some-
what erotic romance. The Dragon was seen as a
symbol of paganism or evil.
The Lambton Worm was a loathsome Dragon
that surfaced in the River Wear, Durham, in the
fourteenth century. Lord Lambton caught it on
his fishing line but threw it down a nearby well
when he realized what it was. For the next few
years, the creature grew in size and began to ter-
rorize the locals, consuming livestock and killing
any would-be slayers. The villagers had to pacify
it by keeping a trough filled with milk for it to
drink. Lambton himself finally killed it but only
because he had protected himself with a spike-
studded coat of mail. A piece of the Dragon’s
hide and the milk trough were still on exhibit at
the castle in the nineteenth century.
In the early fifteenth century, Sir Maurice de
Berkeley is said to have killed a scaly, fire-
breathing Dragon at Dragon Field near Bis-
terne, Hampshire.
Sir Thomas Venables is said to have shot and
killed a Dragon just as it was about to eat a child
in Bache Pool, near Moston, Cheshire, in the
sixteenth century. A 1 632 carving in the church
vestry shows the crest of the Venables as a
Dragon swallowing a child.
A scaly Dragon — 9 feet long, black on top,
reddish below, and with a white ring around its
neck — was roaming St. Leonard’s Forest, near
Horsham, Sussex, in August 1614. It could run
as fast as a man on its four feet, and it killed but
did not eat several cattle, two dogs, and two
people on different occasions. The animal left
behind a slimy trail and spat venom.
A flying Dragon 8-9 feet long with two rows
of sharp teeth and a pair of wings was seen near
Henham, Essex, beginning on May 27 and 28,
1669. It was observed basking in the sun by sev-
eral people, but when they returned with guns
and pitchforks, it darted into Birch Wood.
Possible explanations:
(1) Physical characteristics borrowed from a
vague knowledge of pythons, cobras, and
crocodiles.
(2) An evolved Kuehneosaurus, a 2 -foot-
long, winged reptile that lived in England in
the Late Triassic, 200 million years ago,
proposed by Mark A. Hall. Though known
fossil forms were only capable of gliding
flight, Hall suggests that by the Middle
Ages, it may have grown in size and
developed true flight.
(3) Windsock banners used by armies to
identify specific military units. There was a
whistling device attached to the silk banner
that made hissing noises as the banner was
waved vigorously. A lighted torch was also
placed in the mouth of the banner. The
custom probably originated in China, but
the Romans picked it up during various
wars with the Persians, Scythians, and
Dacians. A Dragon was the standard of a
Roman cohort (one-tenth of a legion). After
the Romans left Britain, the Britons and
Saxons adopted the custom for their own
armies. After the Battle of Hastings in 1066,
the Dragon standard was adopted by the
Normans and was used throughout the
Hundred Years’ War. The national flag of
Wales is a red Dragon, Y Ddraig Goch.
(4) A completely mythical animal used in
moralistic tales.
(5) A symbolic expression of the raids of the
Vikings, whose longboats featured brightly
painted Dragon figureheads.
DRAGON (BRITISH) 145
(6) Tales constructed to explain
monuments, carvings, and heraldic devices
that depicted Dragons; alternatively, place-
names that referred to them.
(7) Legends that underscore the uniqueness
of a community whose lord of the manor is
portrayed as a Dragon slayer or whose local
farm lad has outwitted and killed a monster.
(8) The Dragon is seen by Paul Devereux
and others as a symbol for the unusual
forces and energies associated with sacred
sites in the British landscape. These earth
energies are centered on megalithic
structures such as Stonehenge and are
channeled into invisible streams that
coincide with “leys,” or alignments of roads,
trackways, standing stones, and other
landmarks.

DRAGONS, both winged and wingless. From Konrad Gesner, Historiae animalium (Zurich, Switz.: Christ.
Froschoverum, 1551—1587). (From the original in the Special Collections of Northwestern University Library)
Etymology: From the Greek drdkon (“serpent”
or “sea fish”) or, more literally, “that which kills
at a glance.”
Variant names: Draco (Latin), Dragonet,
Drake, Firedrake, Gaigcuille, LlNDOEM, Lind-
wurm, Peluda, Python, lARASQUE, VOUIVKE.
Physical description: Serpentine. Scaly or
slimy. Black, red, yellow, or white. Crest on the
head. Red eyes. Small mouth. Lion’s limbs.
Sometimes winged. Eagle’s claws. Strong tail.
Behavior: Leaves a putrid slime behind when
it moves on land. Said to be capable of flight.
Extremely venomous, toxic, or contagious. In-
flicts injury with its tail. Can also kill by con-
striction. Said to herald the beginning of wars or
other disasters. Causes floods.
Distribution: Throughout Europe.
Significant sightings: To the ancient Greeks,
the Dragon was a large snake found near tombs.
In 714, the Basque hero Don Teodosio killed
a bat-winged Dragon on Mount Aralar, Spain.
In either 1410 or 1420, a man was lost in a cave
on Mount Pilatus, Switzerland, for five months. It
was the lair of two flying Dragons, and he escaped
by grabbing the tail of one as it flew away.
Ulrich Vogelsang, who sculpted the winged
Dragon of Klagenfurt, Austria, in 1590, based
his design on the skull of a Pleistocene Woolly
rhinoceros ( Coelodonta antiquitatis) dug up in a
nearby quarry in 1335. The legend of a Lind-
wurm that caused floods in the River Gian is
much older, however.
DRAGON (EUROPEAN) 147
On July 26, 1713, a giant serpent, 17 feet 4
inches long, was killed by a forester named Zan-
der near Wroclaw, Poland.
Possible explanations:
(1) Windsock banners carried by medieval
armies. At the Battle of Liegnitz in 1241,
Kaidu’s Mongol army carried Dragon
banners that flamed and fumed. See also
Dragon (British).
(2) Viking or Byzantine ships in the shape
of Dragons may have popularized the myth.
(3) Such astronomical events as comets or
meteors were thought to be flying Dragons.
(4) A union of the more disagreeable aspects
of the Egyptian gods Isis, Osiris, and Horus,
with a large amount of snake, crocodile, and
lizard mixed in, suggested by Grafton Elliot
Smith. From the Nile, this Dragon
prototype spread north, east, and west,
where it was transformed and assimilated by
other cultures, symbolizing the
personification of evil.
(5) Based on dinosaur or pterodactyl fossils.
(6) In the seventeenth century, the Olm
(. Proteus anguineus ), a cave-dwelling, aquatic
salamander of Yugoslavia and northern Italy,
was thought to be the offspring of a Dragon.
It has an eel-like body, white skin, three
pairs of external gills, four tiny legs, and
vestigial eyes. It grows to about 12 inches
long. When washed out of their caves by
heavy rainfall, Olms gather in deep pools,
but they will not voluntarily leave the water.

Dragon Bird
Legendary Bird of East Asia.
Variant names: Hai riyo (Japanese), O-gon-
cho, Schachi hoko, Tobi tatsu.
Physical description: Golden feathers on
wings, body, and tail. Dragonlike head.
Bearded. Clawed feet.
Behavior: Call is a blood-curdling howl.
Distribution: Japan.
Significant sighting: Every fifty years, in a lake
near Kyoto, a white Dragon called Ukisima is
said to take the form of a golden songbird called

ance presaged disease and starvation.
Possible explanation: Said to be the Japanese
equivalent of the winged stage of the Chinese
D RAGON (Ying lung) .

Dre-Mo
Mystery PRIM ATE or BEARof Central Asia, often
confused with the YETI .
148 DRAGON BIRD
Etymology: Tibetan (Sino-Tibetan) word, ap-
parently with various meanings, among them: a
female demon, a person who has gone astray
from a religious life, a she-bear, and the red and
blue varieties of the brown bear.
Variant names: Chemo (“big”), Chemong,
Dredmo (“brown bear”), Dremo.
Physical description: Looks like a bear or large
monkey. Taller than a human. Shaggy reddish,
black, or dark-gray hair. Sometimes white head-
hair. Small eyes. Pointed mouth.
Behavior: Nocturnal. Walks on all fours as
well as bipedally. Growls and whistles. Omniv-
orous. Looks for food under large rocks. Throws
rocks. Kills with its hands (or paws).
Distribution: Eastern Tibet; Bhutan.
Significant sighting: Somewhere southwest of
Alamdo, Tibet, in July 1986, Reinhold Messner
encountered a large, dark-haired animal that
emerged from rhododendron bushes onto the
path about 30 feet ahead of him. It rose on its
hind legs, turned, and ran away on all fours.
Local Tibetans told him it was a Chemo.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Brown bear ( Ursus arctos ),
especially the isabelline or red variety found
in the eastern and central Himalayas, is
known in the Karakoram Range of
Baltistan, Pakistan, as the dreng mo; to the
Ladakhs in Jammu and Kashmir as drin
mor; and in Tibet as the dred mong.
Considered by some a subspecies ( U. a.
isabellinus ), the red bear is generally 5 feet 6
inches-8 feet long, with a reddish, grizzled
coat. It eats grasses, roots, and scavenged
kills such as ibex.
(2) The blue or horse variety of brown bear,
sometimes considered a subspecies ( U. a.
pruinosus ), is found in eastern Tibet and
Sichuan Province, China. Its blue-tinted
brown hairs are tipped with gold or slate-
gray. A yellowish-brown or whitish cape
forms a saddle mark over its shoulders,
hence the name “horse bear.”
(3) The Chemo may refer to the Yeh or
DzuTeh, while the Dre-mo is a bear.

Dsonoqua
Cannibal Giant of western Canada.
Etymology: Kwakiutl (Wakashan), “wild
woman of the woods.”
Variant name: Tsonoqua.
Physical description: Covered with long, black
hair. Long arms. Hairy hands. Sharp claws.
Short hind legs.
Behavior: Antisocial. Upright gait. Most often
described as a cannibal woman.
Distribution: Southwestern British Columbia.
Significant sighting: Represented on carved,
wooden masks used for ritual purposes. Its face
also appears on totem-pole carvings.

Du
Mystery Bird of Oceania.
Etymology: Ajie (Austronesian) word.
Physical description: Red plumage. Star-
shaped, bony structure on its head.
Behavior: Flightless. Can run swiftly with
wings outstretched. Aggressive. Its single egg
hatches in four months. Said to put its egg in a
banyan tree to lure a giant lizard into incubating
it.
Distribution: Isle of Pines, New Caledonia, in
the South Pacific.
DU 149
Significant sighting: On both New Caledonia
and the Isle of Pines, there are large, moundlike
structures, as much as 50 feet in diameter and 5
feet high. Francois Poplin suggests that they are
not burial mounds but piles of earth constructed
by the Du to incubate its eggs.
Present status: At first treated as sacred by local
people, the bird may have become a handy food
source that was eventually exterminated, per-
haps by A.D. 300. However, Lars Thomas re-
ported that it was still thought to be alive in
1991.
Possible explanation: Surviving Giant mega-
pode ( Sylviornis neocaledoniae ), a large galliform
bird whose subfossil bones were first discovered
on the Isle of Pines in 1974. They were radio-
carbon-dated to about 1500 B.G, after the
Melanesians settled the island. The bird was 5-6
feet tall and flightless.

ring to a Spanish household spirit. Used as early
as 1653 for a bandit in Peru; since then, the

Habitat: Caves, mines, mountainous forests,
deep canyons and valleys, rivers, abandoned
houses, plantations, vineyards.

nying a November 1965 report. Coined by re-
porter George May of the Frederick (Md. ) News
Post.

Dzu-Teh
Giant Hominid or unknown Bear of Central
Asia, often confused with the smaller Yeh .
Etymology: Lepcha (Sino-Tibetan) word. Said
to be pronounced “chu-tay.” Meaning and ori-
gin not established, though one derivation is
dzu (“livestock”) + teh (“animal”). Another is
that teh is the same as dred (“bear”). In modern
Tibetan, te is a particle attached to a verb and
means “when,” “after,” “thus,” or “although”
and sometimes forms a gerund (“-ing”).
Variant names: Chhudi (in Sikkim), Churails,
Chu-teh, Chutey.
Physical description: Bearlike but bigger.
Height, 6-9 feet. Shaggy reddish, black, or
DZU-TEH 151
dark-gray hair. Flat head. Pronounced
browridge. Long, powerful arms. Huge hands.
Behavior: Walks on all fours as well as
bipedally. Kills and eats yaks and cattle by
catching them by their horns and twisting their
necks. Said by the Sherpas to be seen at altitudes
of 13,000-15,000 feet.
Tracks: Huge and human-looking.
Distribution: Sikkim State, India; Bhutan;
Tibet.
Possible explanations:
(1) The red or isabelline variety of the
Brown bear ( Ursus arctos isabellinus) has a
pale, reddish-brown coat and stands around
6 feet 6 inches tall. It is found in Alpine
meadows between the tree line and the
snow line. A rarer blue variety ( U. a.
pruinosus, with bluish-brown hairs frosted
with gold or slate-gray) is also known,
especially in Tibet; skins of this bear
obtained in Nepal in 1959 and 1960 by
journalist Desmond Doig were touted as
YETI skins, but there is considerable doubt
that the locals made any such claim.
(2) An evolved Gigantopithecus blacki. This
huge-jawed Pleistocene ape lived as recently
as 500,000 years ago in southern China and
Vietnam, while a smaller species, G.
giganteus , dates to 9-6 million years ago in
the Siwalik Hills of India and Pakistan.
Both species are known only from jaw
fragments and isolated teeth.

DZU-TEH
Ea
The earliest known named MEEBEING, from the
Middle East.
Etymology: Akkadian (Semitic), “he who does
good to men.”
Variant names: Dagon (Hebrew/Semitic),
Enki (Sumerian), Oannes (Greek).
Physical description: Human or goatlike above
the waist, fish tail below. Sometimes shown as
completely human with a fishlike cloak or with
waves springing from its shoulders.
Behavior: Stays in the water at night, comes
on land in the day. Speaks and acts like a human
being.
Distribution: Red Sea.
Significant sighting: The fish- tailed sea god of
the Akkadians, Ea is said to have provided them
with technological and agricultural skills and
the beginnings of their culture. According to the
Babylonian writer Berosus, Ea came out of the
Red Sea and taught things by day, retiring to the
sea at night.

Scotland, said to be found in graveyards. (William M.
Rebsamen/Fortean Picture Library)
Distribution: Aberdeenshire.
Significant sightings: About 1867, a Scottish
gardener plowed up an Earth hound, killing it
after it bit and cut his boot. He took the carcass
home.
In 1915, an Earth hound was turned up by a
plow and killed in the parish churchyard of
Mastrick, Aberdeenshire. It was about the size
of a rat but had molelike feet.

Eastern Puma
The puma is indeed returning to its former
range in the eastern United States and Canada,
153
though this fact has only been reluctantly ac-
cepted by naturalists in recent years. Part of the
reluctance has been based on imprecise witness
descriptions, which can sometimes venture into
the bizarre or supernatural. (Reports from
southern states technically constitute sightings
of the Southern puma, which still exists in very
small numbers in southern Florida.)
Although a case could be made for separating
Eastern puma reports into two categories —
those conforming to a traditional puma that is
expanding its range and those involving a
melanistic or other aberrant animal turning up
in areas that probably could not support a large
cat — the task is too daunting. Black animals are
reported from likely Eastern puma habitats, and
perfectly reasonable puma reports come from
areas where the animal has never been seen be-
fore or since. Misidentifications are rampant,
and AlIEN Big Cats (whatever they may be)
seem to have a presence in North America.
Therefore, all the reports are lumped together in
this category except for the MANED Am EKICAN
LIONS, which at least has an easily identifiable
nonpuma characteristic.
Scientific names: Puma concolor couguar, since
1993; formerly, Felis concolor , a name given by
Carl von Linne in 1771.
Variant names: Beast of Bladenboro,
BOOGER, Catamount, Catawampus, Critter,
Devil cat, Eastern panther, Gallywampus,
Ghost cat, Gla&ACKUS, Indian devil, Mansfield
mystery cat (in Massachusetts), Michichibi,

Wampus cat, Whirling whimpus, Whistling
wampus, Woofin nanny, Wooleneag, Wowzer,
Yati wasagi (Mikasuki/Muskogean, “separated
man”), Zoominzacker (in North Carolina).
Physical description: Powerfully built large cat.
Length, 7-8 feet including tail. Shoulder height,
2-3 feet. Weight, more than 200 pounds. Most
reports are of tan pumas, though about 16-30
percent describe a gray or black pelt. Head de-
scribed as both large and small. Short, pricked
ears. Glowing greenish, yellow, or red eyes.
Long, slender tail.
Behavior: Nocturnal. A female in heat calls
with loud screams. When its natural prey (deer)
has been reduced, it will attack livestock, espe-
cially chickens and rabbits, though goats, sheep,
pigs, dogs, cats, and cows are also vulnerable.
Sometimes, only parts of animals are favored,
such as pigs’ ears. Pumas tend to avoid people,
although attacks have increased since 1990; con-
sequently, it is difficult to reconcile stories of
fearless, intelligently aggressive behavior toward
persons that are occasionally reported, from
midwestern states especially. At least two or
three reports involve an animal that can stand on
its hind legs, a feat that no puma can perform.
Tracks: Front feet are larger than hind feet
and are ahead of or partially overlapped by the
rear feet. Length, 3.5-6 inches wide, 3-5 inches
long. Heel pads have squared-off fronts and
three lobes at the rear. Toes are small, teardrop-
shaped, and widely spaced compared to a dog’s.
Rear feet are asymmetrical. Prints are 25-30
inches apart. Claw marks are sometimes re-
ported; though this is more characteristic of a
dog, big cat tracks will show claws in certain ter-
rain or when the animal is sprinting or leaping.
Habitat: Mountains, forests, swamps.
Distribution: Southeastern Canada and the
United States east of the Mississippi River.
Black pumas have also been reported in Wash-
ington, Texas, and California. In some places in
the United States and Canada, puma sightings
correlate closely with BlGFOOT“hot spots.”

Significant sightings: Reports of mystery fe-
lines prior to the 1950s were not taken seriously
by zoologists. Stories of the GLWACKUS, Neiue
THE LION, and Wampus cats in the South were
collected primarily by folklorists and Forteans.
Marian Harpan Peduzzi saw a glossy, black
panther in 1946 near Berlin, Vermont. It was 4
feet in length, with an elegant, curved tail.
On March 29, 1947, Bruce S. Wright discov-
ered three sets of unmistakable puma tracks
(two adults and one cub) on the border between
Albert and St. John Counties, New Brunswick.
These were the first puma tracks recorded in
eastern Canada in more than 100 years.
Game warden Paul G. Myers shot and
wounded a black cat near Decatur, Illinois, on
October 25, 1955.
Walter Bigelow and his wife saw a strange an-
imal cross the road near Mound Creek, Mis-
souri, in the path of their car headlights in mid-
July 1957. It was black, 3 feet long, tailless, and
“rather stubby.” Later, whatever the animal was,
it scared some hunting dogs that tried to flush it.
On June 2, 1963, Bill Chambers watched a
jet-black puma for fifteen minutes from his
pickup truck near Mahomet, Illinois. It was
hunting in a clover patch 190 yards away. He
estimated its shoulder height as 14-15 inches
and its total length as 4 feet 6 inches to 5 feet.
In the summer of 1966, a hairy, catlike ani-
mal locals called the Woofin nanny killed a
number of animals and pets near Greensboro,
North Carolina, bleeding the carcasses dry
through puncture wounds.
Bruce S. Wright and his wife were driving
west from Fredericton, New Brunswick, on Sep-
tember 28, 1966, when they saw a puma cross
the road in front of them in broad daylight.
On April 10, 1970, Mike Busby was stopped
by the side of the road south of Olive Branch,
Illinois, when an animal with glowing, greenish
eyes, 6 feet tall, black, and standing upright, at-
tacked him. Tumbling him about, the creature
tore his shirt and inflicted some scratches on his
arm, chest, and abdomen. It was scared by a
passing truck and loped away.
In September 1975, citizens of Stockb ridge,
Georgia, reported a black panther that screamed
at night. After the newspaper stories broke,
James Rutledge revealed that he had shot and
killed a black cat the previous spring, but he de-
clined to reveal where he had buried it.
In April 1976, a large male cougar was shot
and killed in Pocahontas County, West Vir-
ginia, after it had killed a farmer’s sheep. Two
days later, an apparently pregnant female was
captured alive. The state’s Department of Nat-
ural Resources no longer has the paperwork on
the case.
From April to June 1977, Sampson County,
North Carolina, was plagued by a mystery ani-
mal that mangled pet cats and dogs, damaged
trailer homes and porch screens, and left nu-
merous clawless, four-toed tracks in the vicinity.
Charles and Helen Marks found more than
200 prints, some with claws, around their trailer
court in Westerville, Ohio, on June 10, 1979.
There were sightings of panthers in the area in
May and June.
In late September 1981, William and Marsha
Medeiros got within 50 feet of a puma along a
trail in the Cape Cod National Seashore near
Truro, Massachusetts.
On June 1, 1982, a Pittsburgh television crew
156 EASTERN PUMA
filmed a thirty-second videotape of a tan puma
near Tarentum, Pennsylvania, on Ruth
O’Brien’s property, where a series of sightings
and puma screams had been reported since July
1979.
On April 24, 1989, Hubert Graham watched
a tawny, juvenile puma sunning itself for twenty
minutes in a clearing below his fire-watch tower
on Blue Hill Mountain, south of Bangor,
Maine.
A videotape of a puma was taken near Waa-
sis, New Brunswick, in the spring of 1990 by
Roger Noble.
In August 1992, a couple in Street, Mary-
land, watched for twenty minutes and took
photographs of a light-brown puma the size of a
German shepherd dog. The cat was seen by oth-
ers as it wandered east through Harford County.
A 3-foot, white puma was seen in the winter
of 1992-1993 around Stewardstown, New
Hampshire.
In December 1993, Wayne Perri of Hartland,
Maine, was walking his dogs when he encoun-
tered a puma near Decker Pond. He took a
photo of the animal, which shows it accompa-
nied by two of his hounds.
Near Craftsbury, Vermont, in the winter of
1994-1995, game wardens found tracks, scat,
and other physical evidence that produced a
DNA match with a puma.
In June 1997, a small female puma was hit by
a truck in western Floyd County, Kentucky.
The witness said the animal was following a
larger cat with another small cat. He picked up
the carcass and turned it over to the Kentucky
Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources,
which kept the carcass in a freezer. It was deter-
mined to be an 8-pound puma kitten with all its
claws intact and no tags or collars on it.
On July 15, 2000, on railroad tracks near
Fort Kaskaskia State Historic Site, Illinois, a
1 1 0-pound, male puma carcass was discovered,
killed by a train. Necropsy results showed that
the animal had all its claws and had been feed-
ing on white-tailed deer, indicating that it was
wild and not an escapee.
Present status: The eastern subspecies ( Puma
concolor couguar) once ranged from New
Brunswick south to South Carolina and west to
Illinois. Because of persistent yet unconfirmed
reports, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
(USFWS) added the Eastern puma to the en-
dangered species list in 1973. Puma sign found
in 1981 convinced Robert Downing of the
USFWS that the animal survived in Virginia
and West Virginia. However, federal and state
agencies have avoided expending scarce conser-
vation resources on an animal still presumed ex-
tinct. In March 1993, based on tracks, hair, and
fecal samples collected near Juniper in Novem-
ber 1992, the New Brunswick Department of
Natural Resources acknowledged the presence
of a puma population in the province.
The southern subspecies [P. c. coryi) formerly
ranged from Georgia and Florida west to
Arkansas and Louisiana; it is now estimated that
only thirty to fifty adults exist in small pockets
of southern Florida. A plan for genetic restora-
tion of the remaining animals began in 1995
with the release of eight female Texas pumas (P.
c. stanleyana) into south Florida.
In eastern and southern states, both pumas
and the deer they fed on were greatly reduced in
numbers in the early nineteenth century as
white settlements advanced into the Appalachi-
ans. Deer did not become extensively stocked
and protected again until the establishment of
state and national parks from the 1930s to the
1950s. There is evidence that a few pumas sur-
vived the critical period between 1900 and 1930
and thus might be responsible for increasing
populations in the East.
Many recent witnesses have reported seeing
Eastern pumas at close range, but few have pro-
duced supporting evidence. The few specimens
reported killed have not been preserved.
Pumas in the western United States are thriv-
ing. Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Mon-
tana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah,
Washington, and Wyoming have healthy popula-
tions, as do British Columbia and Alberta in
Canada. Reports in adjacent states and provinces
occur less frequently and may represent transients.
Black pumas — The leopard and jaguar are the
two cats with the most frequently reported in-
stances of melanism (black coloration).
Melanism is virtually unknown in pumas, with
only three questionable specimens killed in
EASTERN PUMA 157
Brazil (in 1843), Gunnison, Colorado (in 1912),
and Costa Rica (in 1959) and unconfirmed ru-
mors from Nicaragua, Panama, and Argentina.
Normal puma coloration is either tawny or sil-
ver-gray, with no gradations in between. Its rain
forest coloration is sometimes a dark red-brown.
If a recessive gene for melanism were present in
the North American puma population, it would
likely have turned up more frequently in the
wild and in captive breeding populations. Fred-

Narrative of Wanderings through Nicaragua and

Historia natural ediar (Buenos Aires: Compama
Argentina de Editores, 1940); Jim Bob Tinsley,
The Puma: Legendary Lion of the Americas (El
Paso: University of Texas at El Paso, 1987).
Possible explanations:
(1) A black Labrador retriever may
sometimes be mistaken for a melanistic cat.
Other large dog breeds, seen at night from a
distance, might also be taken for a large cat.
(2) A black feral Domestic cat ( Felis silvestris
catus) has been mistaken for a mystery felid
when the witness has unintentionally
exaggerated its size.
(3) The Bobcat ( Lynx rufus) is found within
the Eastern puma’s range but is considerably
smaller (25-30 inches in length) and has a
short tail. Bobcat melanism is rare but
known in Florida.
(4) A number of other animals can make a
noise like a puma’s scream, among them a
feral domestic cat, bobcat, Gray fox
( Urocyon cinereoargenteus ), and Eastern
screech-owl ( Otus asio).
(5) Tracks most commonly mistaken for
pumas are made by a Domestic dog ( Canis
familiaris ), bobcat, and Black bear ( Ursus
americanus ) .
(6) Deer kills in the wild are mostly
inconclusive as evidence, since both released
pet pumas and wild bobcats can kill, drag,
and cover adult deer in the same way that a
puma does.
(7) Pumas mark their paths frequently by
scraping up a patch of dirt with their hind
feet and urinating or spraying on it. Other
animals make similar scratch hills, among
them the Wild boar ( Sus scrofa ), Collared
peccary ( Tayassu tajacu) , bobcat, Jaguar
( Panthera onca ), Ruffed grouse ( Bonasa
umbellus ), Wild turkey {Meleagris gallop avo ) ,
black bear, dog, Squirrel {Sciurus s pp.),
Skunk {Mephitis spp.), and fox.
(8) An escaped circus animal is often offered
as an explanation, but few correlations
between puma sightings and escape
incidents have been documented.
(9) An escaped or released exotic pet,
especially a melanistic Leopard {Panthera
pardus ), is a possibility, although how a
single, large, probably declawed animal that
has lost its hunting skills could persist in the
wild for very long without getting caught
poses a problem.
(10) Puma pelts that have been
intentionally dyed black as a hoax are not
unknown.
(11) The return of pumas to the East may
be the result of the persistence of the
original Puma concolor couguar subspecies,
migration of western or Florida subspecies,
or individuals or groups released into the
wild at different times and places.
As early as 1959, Canadian researcher Bruce
S. Wright came to believe that pumas were
still present in New Brunswick and in
almost every eastern state from the
Canadian border to Florida, but the animals
had become scarce, cautious, and primarily
nocturnal. By 1972, he had documented
304 solid reports from eastern Canada and
44 scattered sightings from Maine to
Alabama.
Naturalist Helen Gerson studied 318
reports from Ontario received by the
provincial Ministry of Natural Resources
between 1935 and 1983. More than half
were logged as “probable.” Only 9 percent
involved black specimens.
John and Linda Lutz, in Eastern Puma
Network News , based in Baltimore,
Maryland, recorded 615 reports in the
United States from 1983 to 1989, with the
greatest numbers by far in Maryland (135),
158 EASTERN PUMA
Pennsylvania (131), and West Virginia
(113). Of these reports, 44 percent involved
multiple witnesses, 27 percent were
observations by hunters, and 37 percent
involved black specimens. The Eastern
Puma Research Network logged 567
sightings in 1991, 435 sightings in 1993
(over half of them in Pennsylvania), 245
sightings in 1994, 510 sightings in 1995,
and 397 sightings in 1999. The percentage
of melanistic individuals seems to be falling,
from 31 percent in 1990 to 16 percent in
1999.
Todd Lester’s Eastern Cougar Foundation,
based in North Spring, West Virginia,
logged 673 sightings from 1995 to 1999.
The greatest number of melanistic pumas
were in West Virginia (122), North
Carolina (17), and Virginia (16).
The Lutzes ranked the top ten states with
the most number of reports as of January
2001 as follows: Tan pumas — Pennsylvania
(920), New York (442), Maryland (361),
West Virginia (330), Virginia (180),
Michigan (158), New Jersey (128), Maine
(124), Illinois (121), and Ohio (118). Black
pumas — Pennsylvania (282), New York
(146), Wisconsin (98), Maryland (86),
West Virginia (76), New Jersey (61), Illinois
(47), Michigan (46), Virginia (35), and
Tennessee (30).
(12) Bruce Wright has suggested that
melanism may have evolved in isolated
Eastern puma populations to increase
elusiveness and ensure survival.
(13) Chad Arment points out that the
evidence for black pumas seems extremely
sparse before the 1940s, and he suggests
that prior to that time, an unknown group
of sport hunters introduced a group of
melanistic Leopards ( Panthera pardus) from
European zoos into the Appalachians or
Ozarks.
(14) Loren Coleman believes that returning
Eastern pumas cannot account for all
American mystery felids, especially those
with black coloration and/or aggressive
behavior patterns. He suggests that the
black cats are surviving female American
lions ( Panthera atrox ), a Pleistocene lion
that died out 9,000 years ago, while the
males are reported as MANED Am ERICAN
Lions.
(15) Errant or escaped mustelids such as the
Fisher (. Martes pennanti ) or Wolverine
(Gulo gulo) might account for observations
of smaller black felids such as the Woofin
nanny. The fisher is particularly catlike, 2
feet long, dark brown to black in color, with
a 15-inch, bushy tail. Its normal range is
northern New England, Canada, and
portions of the Rockies and Coast Ranges in
the West.
(16) The Jaguar undi ( Herpailurus
yaguarondi) is found from south Texas to
Paraguay and has been introduced in
Florida. A medium-sized cat (3 feet— 4 feet 6
inches long) with short legs and a long tail,
the jaguarundi tends to a dark brown or
black color in tropical rain forests. An
escapee might be mistaken for a larger cat.
(17) Jaguars ( Panthera oncd) also have a
melanistic morph but are no longer found
north of Mexico, except possibly in Arizona.

Ecuadorean Giant
GlANTHOMINID of South America.
Physical description: Long head-hair. Beard.
Large eyes.
Behavior: Bloodthirsty. Lives in villages. Fias
knowledge of wells and masonry. Wears animal
skins. Rapes women and kills men. Openly
practices sodomy.
Distribution: Santa Elena, Ecuador.
Significant sighting: A group of giant men is
said to have landed their seagoing rafts near
Santa Elena, Ecuador, in the remote past. Large
fossil ribs, skulls, and teeth were discovered by
Capt. Juan de Olmos of Trujillo in the area in
1543 and attributed to the myth.
Possible explanations:
(1) Memory of a pre-Columbian visit by
Polynesians.
(2) Legends surrounding the Las Vegas
preceramic culture, which lived in the area
8000-4700 B.G In 1977, a burial site
yielded some 200 interments from the
period, including the double burial of a
man and woman entwined in each others’
arms; they became affectionately known as
the “Lovers of Sumpa,” as the area is called.

Distribution: Ecuador.
Present status: Only one report from Ecuador
in the 1980s.
Possible explanation: A surviving Giant
ground sloth ( Megatherium ), which could walk
either bipedally or quadrupedally. This sloth
was a large-bodied browser that lived in South
America from the Late Pliocene to the Pleis-
tocene, 1.9 million-8,000 years ago.

Elephant-Dung Bat
Small, unknown B AT of East Africa.
Physical description: Silver, brownish-gray fur.
Paler underparts. Very small wingspan, possibly
only 5 inches.
Behavior: Roosts on the ground in piles of
dried elephant dung.
Distribution: Marsabit Forest and Mount
Kulal, Kenya.
Significant sighting: Terence Adamson briefly
ran across this bat in the 1950s in two different
locations in Kenya.
Possible explanation: The small Horn-skinned
bat ( Eptesicus floweri ), suggested by Karl
Shuker, has a habit of roosting in acacia roots,
which are possibly comparable in texture to
dried dung. It is known in Mali and southern
Sudan.

ELEPHANTS (Unknown)
There are three species of living Elephants
(Order Proboscidea): the African bush elephant
( Loxodonta africana ), the African forest elephant
(L. cyclotis ), and the Asian elephant ( Elephas
maximus). DNA tests conducted in 2001 con-
firmed that the two African species are geneti-
cally distinct and probably diverged about 2.6
million years ago. Elephas evolved in Africa but
migrated to Eurasia around the same time.
Asian elephants are smaller, with humped or
rounded backs, smaller ears, and one finger in-
stead of two on the tip of the trunk.
The African bush elephant is the largest
known living terrestrial animal. The average
adult male stands 9 feet 10 inches- 12 feet 2
inches at the shoulder and weighs 4. 4-7.7 tons.
The largest specimen on record had a shoulder
height of 13 feet and an estimated weight of
13.5 tons; it was shot in Angola on November
7, 1974.
Though elephants are best known for their
elongated trunks, their earliest ancestors com-
pletely lacked them. The hippo-sized
Moeritherium of the Late Eocene (35 million
years ago) had nasal bones placed far forward on
its face, indicating a lack of large muscles neces-
sary for a trunk. The identifying characteristics
of proboscideans are much less obvious and in-
volve particular skull and shoulder-blade fea-
tures, teeth with unique cusps, hind feet with a
specific ankle formation, and wrists with serial
bone arrangement. The earliest was Phos-
phatherium , which weighed about 33 pounds
and stood 2 feet at the shoulder. Proboscideans
first evolved, probably in North Africa, near the
end of the Paleocene, 55 million years ago, from
primitive hoofed mammals called condylarths.
The best-known extinct proboscideans are
mastodons and mammoths, which were contem-
poraneous in North America for about 4 million
years in the Pliocene and Pleistocene. American
Mastodons (Family Mammutidae) were
browsers that split off from the elephant family
tree in the Oligocene, nearly 30 million years
ago, while the Mammoths (Family Elephanti-
dae) were grazers with a slender build; a taller
skull; inwardly-curving tusks that projected well
below the horizontal; and flat, ridged teeth.
Mammoths died out relatively recently at the
end of the Pleistocene in both Eurasia and
North America. They are featured in about 400
162 ELEPHANT-DUNG BAT
cave paintings in Europe; in Ukraine, archaeol-
ogists have discovered dwellings constructed
partially from mammoth bones and tusks. In
North America, there is considerable evidence
that the Paleo-Indians hunted or scavenged
mammoths as recently as 10,000 years ago. Folk
traditions of these interactions may be preserved
in myths of the Mam ANTU in Siberia and China
and the StifrLegged Bear in North America.
Another group of proboscideans, the gom-
photheres, may have lingered in Southeast Asia
and provided inspiration for the MAKARA.
The Beast of Bardia, the Pygmy Elephant
and the Thai MAMMOTH could represent new
species or distinct variations in known forms.

Buenos Aires area of Santa Cruz Province, Ar-
gentina; southern Mendoza Province, Argentina.
Present status: Probably extinct.
Possible explanations:
(1) May represent a recently surviving
Patagonian cave-dwelling sloth (. Mylodon
darwinii ), subfossil remains of which are
known from the Cueva del Milodon in
southern Chile. Manuel Palacios told Bruce
Chatwin there was a rock painting of a
Mylodon in the Monumento Natural los
Bosques Petrificados, Santa Cruz Province,
Patagonia.

Emela-Ntouka
Unknown DlNOSAUR-like reptile or HOOFED
Mam M AL of Central Africa.
Etymology: Bomitaba (Bantu), “killer of ele-
phants” or “eater of the tops of the palms.”
Variant names: Aseka-moke, CHIPEKWE,
Emeula natuka, Emia-ntouka (in the Congo),
Forest rhinoceros, Ngamba-namae, Ngoulou
(Baka/Ubangi), NSANGA, Nyama
Physical description: As large as an elephant or
larger. Reddish-brown to gray. Hairless. Single,
large, curved, ivory horn on its nose. Beaked
mouth. Short, frilled neck. Massive legs. Heavy
tail like a crocodile’s.
Behavior: Amphibious. Foul-tempered.
EMELA-NTOUKA 163
The Emela-ntouka, an elephant-killing, dinosaur-like animal of Central Africa. (William M. Rebsamen)
Snorts, howls, and roars. Feeds on a wide vari-
ety of leaves, including the Malombo liana (like
the MOKEIE-MBEMBE). Disembowels elephants,
buffalos, and hippopotamuses with its horn.
Tracks: Like a rhinoceros.
Habitat: Dense rain forest.
Distribution: Liberia; Boumba and Ngoko
Rivers, eastern Cameroon; Gabon; Loubomo,
Kelle, Ouesso, Impfondo, Dongou, and Epena
in the Republic of the Congo; Central African
Republic; Zambia.
Significant sightings: In 1913, Hans Schom-
burgk heard stories from the Klao tribe about a
small rhinoceros that lived in the mountains of
Liberia.
In 1950, a French official named Millet, sta-
tioned at Kelle in the Republic of the Congo,
heard of a rhinoceros that lived in the forests.
Inhabitants of the district drew sketches of its
footprint, which resembled that of a rhinoceros.
In August or September 1966, Atelier Yvan
Ridel photographed some 10-inch-wide, three-
toed footprints along a riverbank northeast of
Loubomo, Republic of the Congo.
Roy Mackal collected information on the
Emela-ntouka during his expeditions to the
Congo in 1980 and 1981, noting that lore
about the animal is often confused with that of
the Mokeie-Mbembe.
Possible explanations:
(1) A semiaquatic rhinoceros that inhabits
the rain forest, suggested by Lucien
Blancou, though the large tail argues against
it. A semiaquatic fossil rhino named
Teleoceras is known from 17—5 million years
ago in Late Miocene river and lake
sediments of North America. It was
hippolike, with short limbs, a massive body,
and high-crowned teeth.
(2) Roy Mackal has proposed a surviving
ceratopsian dinosaur like Monoclonius , a
quadrupedal herbivore about 1 8 feet long
with a backwardly curved nose horn and a
bony neck frill. Monoclonius fossils have
been found in Montana and Alberta and
date from the Late Cretaceous, about 70
million years ago. However, no ceratopsians
are known from Africa. Also, they were egg-
laying dinosaurs, and no reports of the
Emela-ntouka describe it as oviparous.
(3) The elephant-sized Elasmotherium was a
Pleistocene rhino with a 7-foot horn in the
center of its forehead. It is known from
grasslands in Europe, Siberia, and China.

Enkidu
The original mythical image of the WlLDM AN in
the Middle East, from the Babylonian Epic of
Gilgamesh. Enkidu was a wild warrior and com-
panion to Gilgamesh, the king of the city-state

ENTITIES
Despite the desire of most cryptozoologists to
explain all observations of unknown animals in
zoological terms, there nonetheless exist experi-
ences that seem to belong to the psychic, the
paranormal, or the spiritual world rather than
the physical. BLACK DOGS disappear into thin
air, FLYING Humanoids with batlike wings ap-
pear in an area of concentrated unidentified fly-
ing object (UFO) reports, and HAIRY BIPEDS are
impervious to bullets.
These high-strangeness cases often, but not
always, intertwine the metaphysical or cultural
belief systems of the observer with whatever
stimulus happens to be physically present. A
furtive shadow on the wall in a New Delhi sub-
urb becomes a menacing MONKEY Man; an
out-of-place moose is transformed into an extra-
terrestrial-like Dover Demon; a distant house
cat provides the inspiration for an ALIEN Big
C AT report; an odd combination of unrelated
sights, sounds, and smells creates the illusion of
a mythical CHUPACABRAS with fiery red eyes.
Sometimes, the stimulus is a cryptid whose
appearance is magnified through a filter of fear
and preconception. Undoubtedly, the BEAST OF
Ge\AUDAN (a hyena) contributed to WEREWOLF
lore in eighteenth-century France. The sighting
of an errant B IGFOO T reinforces the CANNIBAL
GIANT folklore espoused by a startled Native
American or muddles the sensory input of a
midwestern couple unfamiliar with the physical
characteristics of a Pacific Northwest hominid.
Of course, it is possible that genuine appari-
tions of a psychic nature are responsible for
some of these phenomena. Whether or not
that’s true, cryptozoologists still need to study
Entity cases in order to discern the differences
between Sm ALLHOMINIDS andLlTILE PEOPLE or
between BLACK DOGS and German shepherds
on the loose. Are fiery red eyes always a charac-
teristic of a paranormal entity? Or are there cir-
cumstances under which the eyes of real animals
can appear red and luminous? We need to know
the precise mechanisms by which observers per-
ceive or misperceive unusual, unexpected, or in-
explicable events and how belief and veridical
experience interact.
Eleven of the fifteen Entities in this section
have a roughly human or humanoid shape.

Ethiopian Deer
Unidentified HOOFED Mam M AL of East Africa.
Distribution: Southern Ethiopia.
Significant sighting: Apparently known to the
ancient Egyptians.
Possible explanations:
(1) Surviving fossil giraffid ( Climacoceras)
that lived in the Miocene (18—6 million
years ago) in East Africa. It had branched,
antlerlike cranial appendages.
(2) Ethiopian subspecies of the Fallow deer
( Dama damd) found in Ethiopia and Egypt
from the Late Pliocene to the Late
Pleistocene (2 million-10,000 years ago).

Ethiopian Hyrax
Unknown HYRAX of East Africa.
Distribution: Southern Ethiopia.
Significant sighting: There is a vague tradition
of a giant herbivorous mammal, 4 feet long and
2 feet high at the shoulder, in the Ethiopian
desert.
Possible explanation: Unknown species of
Hyrax (. Procavia ) or Bush hyrax (Heterohyrax) .

Ethiopian Vampire Bat
Unknown B AT of East Africa.
Variant name: Death bird.
Physical description: Wingspan, 12-18 inches.
Behavior: Said to feed on the blood of animals
and humans, causing puncture wounds and de-
bilitating sickness.
Distribution: Devil’s Cave, somewhere near
Nek’emte, in the Welega division of Ethiopia.
Significant sighting: In the 1930s, Byron de
Prorok explored a cave said by the locals to be
haunted by hyena-men and a death bird. The
hyenas proved real enough, and so did the death
birds, in the form of a huge swarm of bats. De
Prorok noted that goatherds in the area looked
very debilitated, and they blamed their condi-
tion on bites from these bats.
Possible explanations:
(1) The only known sanguinivorous bats are
found in Mexico, Central, and South
America. Infected bites from parasites
carried by the bats might be mistaken for
bat bites.
(2) Fungal spores from guano or Leptospira
bacteria causing Weil’s syndrome, which
produces liver and kidney problems,
meningitis, and vomiting, could be
mistakenly blamed on bat bites.
(3) African vampire legends might also
exaggerate a normal bat’s activities.

ETHIOPIAN VAMPIRE BAT 167
European Flying Snake
Flying Reptile of Southern Europe.
Physical description: Length, 3-6 feet. Green,
black, gray, or white. Sometimes said to have
wings.
Behavior: Moves along the ground in a
straight line. Emits a peculiar vocalization.
Distribution: Alpes-Maritimes Department,
France; near Sarajevo, Bosnia; Bulgaria.
Significant sightings: In 1930 or 1931, a green
snake with wings frightened the mother of
Andre Mellira in a forest near La Bollene-
Vesubie, Alpes-Maritimes Department, France.
In Bulgaria in the summer of 1947, Hazel
Goksu surprised a group of snakes 3-6 feet long
on a footpath. With a peculiar cry, they flew
into the air 6-9 feet above the ground toward a
spring and vanished behind some trees.

Fairies engage in such complex social structures
as government, art, music, marriage, labor, fu-
neral s, and war.
Distribution: Worldwide but especially
known in Ireland, Scotland, Iceland, Isle of
Man, and Norway.
Significant sightings: In 1188, a Welsh cleric
named Elidyr told Gerald of Wales that when
he was t wel ve years ol d, he had encount ered t wo
tiny men who led him through a dark tunnel
and int o a fant ast ic real m of 1 it 1 1 e peopl e rul ed
by a king. He returned to visit several times
until he tried stealing a golden ball. The little
men pursued and took it back from him, aft er
which he coul d no 1 onger find t he t unnel .
In 1757, when British cleric Edward Wil-
liams was seven years old, he and some other
chil dren pi aying in a fiel d in Wal es saw a group
oft iny coupl es dressed in red and carrying whit e
kerchiefs. One of the little men, who had an
“ancient, swarthy, grim complexion,” chased
t he chil dren. The incident puzzl ed Wil 1 iams al 1
his life.
In t he early t went iet h cent ury, W. Y. Evans-
Wentz traveled throughout Ireland, Scotland,
Wales, Cornwall, and Brittany, gathering many
oral traditions of Fairies from all social classes.
One informant, named Neil Colton, told him
about Fairies he had seen in t he mid-ninet eent h
century at Lough Derg, County Donegal, Ire-
land. He and some other children were gather-
ing berries when they heard music and saw six
to eight of them dancing a few hundred feet
away. A little woman came running toward
t hem and hit a girl on t he face wit h a green rush.
The girl faint ed aft er t hey al 1 ran home and was

was only in 1983 that the women finally admit-
ted to using cutouts from Princess Mary's Gift
Book (London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1914),
by Princess Mary, Countess of Harewood, on
two of the photos taken in 1917. Three other
photos taken in August 1920 with a different
camera were probably double exposures. How-
ever, they never denied seeing real Fairies in the
beck near Cottingley, Yorkshire, and claimed
the hoax was done to demonstrate their reality.
The photos and related documents sold for
£22,000 at an auction in July 1998.
On April 30, 1973, Mary Treadgold was
traveling by bus on the Island of Mull in Scot-
land when she looked out the window and saw
a small figure, about 18 inches high, who ap-
peared to be digging peat with a spade. It was
dressed in bright-blue pants and suspenders and
a white shirt with rolled-up sleeves, and it re-
mained completely still as the bus passed.
Unexpected mishaps during construction of a
new road at Akureyri, Iceland, in 1984 were
blamed on the local fairies. Helgi Hallgrimsson,
director of the Akureyri Natural History Mu-
seum, has collected many eyewitness reports
from the district around Eyjafjordur, where a
Fairy town is said to be located.
Brian Collins, age fifteen, was vacationing on
Aran Island, County Donegal, Ireland, around
1992 when he saw two men about 3 feet 6
inches tall, talking in Irish and dressed in green
with brown boots. They were sitting on a bank,
fishing in the ocean, but suddenly they jumped
away and disappeared. Collins retrieved a pipe
one had been smoking, but it later disappeared
from a locked drawer.
Present status: Not a traditional cryptozoolog-
ical puzzle in that these diminutive entities do
not seem to belong to the purely physical realm.
However, Fairies serve as a reminder that even
Western cultures can have difficulty separating
the real world from the paraphysical.
Possible explanations:
(1) Folk memories of a race of small-statured
people said to have existed in Europe in
antiquity, suggested by Elizabeth Andrews
and others. The survival of megalithic
monuments that were apparently built by
shorter people contributed to this belief.
(2) Folk memories of Celtic or other pagan
gods, dimly remembered from pre-Christian
times.
(3) Folk memories of an ancient cult of the
dead or actual spirits of the dead. Various
types might be classed as the evil dead, the
recently dead, the heathen dead, and the
ancient dead.
(4) Nature spirits of gardens and glens;
elemental personifications of trees, plants,
earth, and water.
(5) Hallucinations of some kind, perhaps by
fantasy-prone individuals.
(6) Paranormal or supernatural apparitions,
fallen angels, or a race of beings halfway
between the material and the spiritual.
(7) A premodern manifestation of entities
related to the unidentified flying object
(UFO) phenomenon. Individuals who are
“taken by the fairies” have been compared
to those who claim abduction by UFO
aliens.

Father-of-All-the-T urtles
A giant TURTLE, one category of SEA MONSTER
identified by Bernard Heuvelmans.
Etymology: From a Sumatran legend.
Variant name: Aspidochelone (Greek, “snake-
turtle”).
Physical description: Tortoiselike head. Large,
prominent eyes. Wide mouth. No teeth.
Medium-length, slender neck. Rounded cara-
172 FANGALABOLO
pace with a saw-toothed ridge. Large scales on
the back. Two pairs of flippers.
Behavior: Breathes through its mouth, mak-
ing a whistling noise.
Distribution: North Atlantic Ocean and the
Caribbean Sea.
Significant sightings: As his three caravels
sailed east along the southern coast of the Do-
minican Republic in early September 1494,
Christopher Columbus and his crew saw a
whale-sized turtle that kept its head out of the
water. It had a long tail with a fin on either side.
On March 30, 1883, the schooner Annie L.
Hall sighted what looked like a capsized ship on
the Grand Banks (or off the Azores if you go by
the longitude provided) in the North Atlantic
Ocean. However, it turned out to be a turtle
“40 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 30 feet from the
apex of the back to the bottom of the under
shell.” The flippers were 20 feet long. This re-
port was apparently confused in contemporary
newspapers with a more conventional, 100-
foot-long Sea Monster sighting that took place
in November 1883 by Capt. W. L. Green and
some fishermen off Long Branch, New Jersey.
On March 8, 1955, L. Alejandro Velasco was
stranded on a raft off the Gulf of Uraba, Colom-
bia, when he saw a yellow turtle about 14 feet
long.
In June 1956, the cargo steamer Rhapsody re-
ported a 4 5 -foot turtle with a white carapace
south of Nova Scotia. It had flippers 15 feet
long and could raise its head 8 feet out of the
water.
On September 13, 1959, Tex Geddes and
James Gavin were fishing off Soay in the Inner
Hebrides, Scotland, when they saw the head and
back of a huge animal approach them until it was
only 20 yards away. Its body was 4-8 feet broad
at the water line, and the back was 2 feet-2 feet 6
inches high. They watched it for five minutes,
after which it dived and swam further out to sea.
In August 1971, NESSlE-hunter Tim Dinsdale
discovered a huge, dead turtle in a storage shed
in Mallaig on the coast of Scotland not far from
Soay. He estimated its weight at 1,500 pounds.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Atlantic leatherback turtle
{Dermochelys coriacea coriacea) ranges
throughout the North Atlantic from
Newfoundland to the British Isles and can
reach a length of 7-8 feet. It has
longitudinal ridges on its back but no
jagged ridge. It rarely exceeds 800 pounds.
(2) A surviving Archelon ischyros, the largest
known turtle, measured up to 16 feet long
and 12 feet wide, and may have weighed as
much as 11,000 pounds. It lived some 70
million years ago in marine seas of the Late
Cretaceous. Fossils have been found in
South Dakota, Kansas, and Colorado.

Fating’ho
Sm ALL Hom inid of West Africa.
Etymology: Mandinka (Mande) word.
Variant name: Kudeni.
Physical description: Large head. Long head-
hair. Red eyes. Shaggy, black body-hair.
Behavior: Walks upright. Grunts.
Habitat: Dense forests.
Distribution: Senegal; northern Guinea.
Significant sightings: Long ago, a hunter from
around Diaroume, Senegal, captured a female
FATING’HO 173
Fating’ho and succeeded in taming it and hav-
ing children by it. A daughter, named Na Fan-
cani, was said to be of great beauty, and her de-
scendants still lived in the area in 1945.
In November 1992, entomologist Malang
Mane was collecting specimens at an altitude of
3,600 feet in a forested area of northern Guinea
when he saw a man-sized, black-haired creature
walk to within a few feet of him before it ran
away.

Filipino Secretary Bird
Unknown Bird of prey of Southeast Asia.
Physical description: Feathers longer on the
lower portion of the crest. Outermost tail feath-
ers longer than the inner feathers.
Distribution: Philippine Islands.
Significant sighting: French naturalist Pierre
Sonnerat visited the Philippines from 1771 to
1772 and reported the existence of a large bird
of prey similar to the secretary bird of sub-Saha-
ran Africa.
Present status: No known species of secretary
bird exists outside Africa.
Possible explanations:
(1) Specimens of the African Secretary bird
(. Sagittarius serpentarius) , a long-legged,
crested, eaglelike bird, may have been
bought to the Philippines by traders.
(2) Sonnerat might have heard secondhand
accounts of the Philippine eagle
(Pithecophaga jefferyi), which was unknown
in the eighteenth century.

FISHES (Unknown)
In general, a fish is a streamlined animal with a
backbone that swims by undulations and
breathes through gills. It has a cranium and a
muscular tail with a tail fin. There are several
different groups, the most important three
being the sharks, rays, and chimaeras with carti-
laginous skeletons (Class Chondrichthyes); the
familiar ray-finned fishes with bony skeletons
(Actinopterygii); and the lobefins and lungfishes
that belong to the Sarcopterygii, which have
pairs of fleshy fins or limbs with a series of in-
ternal bones, only one of which is attached to
the shoulder girdle or pelvis. This last group is
174 FAUN
the one from which humans — indeed, all
tetrapods (four-legged animals) — evolved.
The earliest recognizable bony fishes arose in
the Ordovician period, more than 450 million
years ago. Called ostracoderms, they lacked
movable jaws but had a distinctive brain encased
in cranial bones and often were armored with
bony plates and scales. Other jawless fish, the
still-existing lampreys and hagfishes, are about
300 million years old, from the late Carbonifer-
ous; they probably arose from a different group
of ostracoderms than the jawed fishes.
The earliest fish with jaws probably appeared
as early as the late Ordovician, 450 million years
ago. Microscopic scraps of sharklike skin denti-
cles have been found in the United States dating
from that time and in Mongolia from the Sil-
urian, about 420 million years ago. The most
anatomically primitive shark fossils date from
the Late Devonian, 360 million years ago. Even
at this early stage, this class of animal had an
elongate body, large triangular fins, an upturned
tail, and a mouth filled with rows of teeth.
The placoderms were a formidable group of
jawed fishes from the Late Devonian and were
the largest vertebrates of their time, some of
them reaching 26-33 feet in length. Nearly 200
fossil placoderm genera are known.
The earliest fossil lobefins are from China,
Spitsbergen, Norway, and Canada and date
from the Early Devonian, 400 million years ago.
For a time, before bony fishes got into their
stride, they were the dominant fishes of the De-
vonian. Lungfishes and coelacanths are the only
finned relatives of land animals to have survived
the major extinction at the end of the Permian,
251 million years ago. The COELACANTHS in-
clude only two living saltwater species ( Latime -
via chalumnae and L. menadoensis). Some of the
more primitive coelacanths had a sharklike,
asymmetrical tail with special muscles that al-
lowed it to twitch. Coelacanths of the Early
Cretaceous, 120 million years ago, such as
Mawsonia (10 feet long), lived in brackish wa-
ters in Brazil and Africa.
Isolated scales from relatives of bony fishes
have been obtained from the late Silurian of Rus-
sia and China, and fragmentary bones and teeth
have been found in similar strata in Estonia. One
of the most primitive bony species known is
Cheirolepis, from the Middle Devonian, 380 mil-
lion years ago. Its anatomy suggests it was a swift
swimmer, and the pointed teeth in its large
mouth indicate it was an efficient predator.
Almost half of all known species of verte-
brates now alive are ray-finned bony fishes; the
23,681 species cataloged in 1994 by Joe Nelson
are probably a vast underestimate, since isolated
pools and streams in tropical forests can, over
time, evolve new varieties. Sturgeons (Family
Acipenseridae) belong to a primitive group
called chondrosteans that are separate from the
more advanced teleost fishes. Often listed as
candidates for FRESHWATER MONSTERS, stur-
geons have largely cartilaginous skeletons and
live in the sea but travel a long distance up rivers
and into lakes to breed. Teleost fishes fall into
four major groupings: the Bonytongues (Os-
teoglossomorpha); Eels and Tarpons (Elopo-
morpha); Fierrings and their relatives (Clupeo-
morpha); and everything else, from salmon to
minnows (Euteleostei).
The largest living fish is the Whale shark
(Rhincodon typus ), found in tropical oceans. In
early 1919, an unverified 55-foot whale shark be-
came wedged in a fish trap off Ban Ko Chik,
Thailand. A huge individual known as Sapodilla
Tom frequented the waters off Fionduras for fifty
years and was said to measure 60-70 feet in
length. The largest official specimen measured 41
feet 6 inches and was caught in the Indian Ocean
off Karachi, Pakistan, on November 11, 1949.
The largest carnivorous fish is the Great white
shark ( Carcharodon c arch arias) , which averages
14-15 feet in length. Outsize specimens grow to
at least 20 feet.
The largest bony fish is the Ocean sunfish
( Mola mold), which averages 6 feet from snout
to tail and 8 feet in vertical length; an outsize
specimen caught in 1908 off Sydney, Australia,
measured 10 by 14 feet. The largest freshwater
fish is the Giant catfish or Pa beuk ( Pangasian -
odon gigas ), found in the Mekong River and its
tributaries in Southeast Asia. A specimen 9 feet
10 inches long and weighing 533 pounds was
caught in the Ban Mee Noi River, Thailand.
Of the twenty-three fishes in this list, seven
appear to be unknown ray- finned fishes, eight
FISHES 175
appear to be sharks or rays, one might be a sur-
viving placoderm, three are lungfishes or
lobefins, two are of ambiguous provenance, and
two others are probably not fishes at all.
Some Sea Monsters, Freshwater Mon-
sters, and MERBEINGS may also involve known
or unknown species of fishes.

Scientific name: Bathysidus pentagrammus,
given by William Beebe.
Physical description: Roundish body. Five
lines of purple and yellow photophores on the
sides. Large eyes. Small pectoral fins.
Distribution: North Atlantic Ocean.
Significant sighting: Observed only once at
1,900 feet by William Beebe in a bathysphere
off Bermuda in the early 1930s.
Possible explanation: Carl Hubbs thought
Beebe had seen a mass of jellyfish distorted by the
mist of his breath on the bathysphere’s porthole.

Five-Toed Llama
Unknown HOOFED Mam M ALof South America.
Significant sighting: Pottery fragments show-
ing animals that look like llamas with five toes
were discovered in the 1920s in the pre-Incan
Paracas culture area near Pisco, lea Department,
Peru, by Julio C. Tello. Estimates of the cul-
ture’s age are now put between 600 B.G and A.D.
200. Tello also apparently came across bones
that seemingly belonged to such an animal. Lla-
mas normally have only two toes, and most fos-
sil camelids are similarly cloven-hoofed.
Possible explanations:
(1) A Llama (Lama glama) with polydactyly,
a condition producing more than the
normal number of toes, might have been
given special treatment by Paracan artists
and shamans. Llamas have been
domesticated for thousands of years; their
ancestors are represented in cave paintings
in the Cueva de las Manos, Rio Pinturas,
Santa Cruz Province, Argentina.
(2) An unknown variety of litoptern, an
order of odd-toed South American
ungulates that ultimately died out in the
Pleistocene. Some were medium-sized and
horselike ( Thoatherium ), while others were
long-necked with an elongated tapirlike
snout (Macrauchenia) . Most had three toes,
but some were reduced to one toe.

Significant sightings: William H. Smith saw a
winged human form moving over Brooklyn,
New York, on September 18, 1877.
In September 1880, a black man with bat’s
wings was seen flying 1,000 feet over Coney Is-
land toward New Jersey. The figure had a “cruel
and determined expression.”
On April 14, 1897, B. C. Wells, the mayor of
Mount Vernon, Illinois, and other citizens saw
something that resembled the “body of a huge
man swimming through the air with an electric
light on his back.” The incident occurred dur-
ing a wave of unidentified flying object (UFO)
sightings throughout the midwestern United
States.
On July 11, 1908, writer Vladimir K. Ar-
sen’ev encountered what he thought was a flying
man in the Sikhote Alin Mountains, Siberia.
Local hunters had apparently seen it on other
occasions.
On January 6, 1948, Bernice Zaikowski and
a group of children in Chehalis, Washington,
claimed to have seen a man flying by means of
long, mechanical wings that he manipulated
with instruments on his chest.
In 1952, U.S. Air Force private Sinclair Tay-
lor saw what he thought was an enormous bird
while on guard duty at Camp Okubo near
Kyoto, Japan. As it hovered not far away, he saw
it had the body of a man about 7 feet tall and a
7-foot wingspan. Fie emptied his carbine into it
as it landed but couldn’t find a trace of it.
Hilda Walker and two other residents of
Houston, Texas, on June 18, 1953, watched a
bat-winged figure wearing a cape and bathed in
a dim, gray light glide into a pecan tree at 1 1 8
East Third Street. The light faded, and the fig-
ure disappeared as a torpedo-shaped object
swooped overhead.
U.S. Marine Earl Morrison was on guard
duty near Da Nang, Vietnam, in the summer of
1969 when he and two other soldiers saw a
naked woman with black, furry skin fly about
6-7 feet over their heads just after 1:00 AM. It
was about 5 feet high; flew by flapping black
wings attached to its arms, hands, and fingers;
and gave off an eerie greenish glow.
Possible explanations:
(1) Test flights of personal aeronautical
devices.
(2) UFO phenomena or paranormal
apparitions.
(3) Misidentifications of various birds or
bats.

FLYING REPTILES
In the animal world, there are three types of
flight: gliding, soaring, and powered. Gliding is
passive, involving extended body surfaces that
transform a vertical fall into a gradual transverse
descent. A diapsid reptile named Coelurosaur-
avus, found in Western Europe and Madagascar,
was the first vertebrate to develop this method in
the Late Permian, 260 million years ago; it was
1-2 feet long and had large, retractable wings
supported by twenty-two rodlike bones that
were not attached to the skeleton and probably
were evolved specifically for flight. Another glid-
ing reptile, Icarosaurus siefkeri, lived during the
FLYING REPTILES 177
Triassic, 175-200 million years ago, and devel-
oped a gliding flight from membranes attached
to hinged wing struts extended from its ribs; it
was 7 inches long and had a 10-inch wingspan.
The Common flying lizard ( Draco volans) of
Malaysia is similarly outfitted with wings sup-
ported by elongated ribs; these are spread when
it jumps from trees and glides as far as 30 feet to
the ground. Other gliders include the Chinese
gliding tree frog ( Polypedates dennysi ), which has
suction cups on its toes that enable it to stick to
the bark and leaves of the tropical trees and
webbed feet that act as parachutes as it falls from
tree to tree; the 7-inch Flying gecko ( Ptychozoon
lionotum ), which has a loose fold of skin along
its legs that allows it to glide; and the 3- to 4-
foot Golden tree snake ( Chrysopelea ornata) of
Malaysia and Indonesia that jumps from tree to
tree by contracting its body into a concave sur-
face to slow its fall and by undulating in the air
to change course (broad, keeled scales on its un-
derside allow it to grip the tree bark).
Soaring is accomplished by using extended
body surfaces to navigate air currents or rising
columns of air, as hawks and eagles do. Powered
flight is generated by flapping paired aerody-
namic wings up and down, creating lift.
The flying reptiles of the Mesozoic were ca-
pable of both soaring and true flight. Pterosaur
wing membranes were attached to a tremen-
dously elongated fourth finger, supported by
three other digits that allowed the animal to
crawl on the ground or clamber through trees
after the wing was folded. The early, crow-sized,
short-tailed pterodactyls were powered, flapping
fliers, slightly unstable yet agile. Long-tailed,
narrow-winged pterosaurs such as Rham-
phorhynchus were probably accomplished soar-
ers. Pteranodon y with a wingspan of 23 feet, was
capable of short, powered flights but was better
at long, soaring flights over the sea. The large,
short-tailed Cretaceous pterosaurs, such as
Quetzalcoatlus with a wingspan of 38 feet, were
limited to continuous gliding and soaring under
mild weather conditions.
Of the thirteen flying reptiles in this section,
five are clearly identified as flying (or gliding)
snakes. The other eight have been compared to
pterosaurs by observers or commentators. The
evidence for any one of these cryptids is not par-
ticularly strong, but collectively, these creatures
embody an intriguing tradition.
Additional types of animals or legends may be
involved, such as unknown types of B ATS, Big
BIRDS, or various DRAGON traditions. A Mayan
relief sculpture of a bird with reptilian charac-
teristics was discovered in the 1960s by archae-
ologist Jose Diaz-Bolio at the ruins of El Taj in
in Veracruz State, Mexico, which flourished
from A.D. 600 to 1200. Such representations are
considered by Mayan scholars to depict either
stylized birds such as Macaws (parrots of the
genera Ara and Anodorhynchus) or myths such as
the celestial bird Itzam-yeh, which represents
nature tamed by the Mayans. Some have com-
pared the El Taj in sculpture to a primitive bird
such as an Archaeopteryx or a pterosaur. “Ser-

FRESHWATER MONSTERS
A wide variety of unidentified animals have
been reported in freshwater lakes and rivers
around the world. These animals often go under
the generic name of lake monsters or river mon-
sters. Most also are known by the name of the
lake or river plus the word “monster,” as in the
“Payette Lake monster.”

Some of the most common descriptions are
of animals that resemble either a telephone pole,
a big fish, an overturned boat (especially larger
individuals), a head and long neck, a floating
log, a serpent, or a string of humps. The shape
of the head is most often described as either
horselike, cowlike, serpentine, crocodilian, or
fishlike. Ridges, spines, or horns are sometimes
reported. Appendages include fins, flippers, or
feet. The skin is as often smooth as scaly.
Whiskers and a mane are frequent adornments.
It is difficult and probably ill advised to place
specific Freshwater monsters into distinct cate-
gories. Eyewitness descriptions are often impre-
cise, and in many cases, the animals themselves
appear to lack any distinguishing features other
than unusual size. Several different descriptions
FRESHWATER MONSTERS 179
may be given for animals seen in one specific
lake. Though this could mean that several un-
known species live in the same body of water, it
is more likely that (1) descriptions of an unex-
pected, exotic animal viewed at a distance under
unfavorable atmospheric or optical conditions
by untrained observers may often be less than
accurate, and/or (2) cultural preconceptions of
what a Freshwater monster should look like may
override an observer’s objectivity.
However, in general, at least four categories
of unknown animals seem to be involved:
(1) A long-necked animal, perhaps a
freshwater equivalent of Bernard
Heuvelmans’s marine LONGNECK. Some of
the most notable are CHAMP, NESSIE, and
S TORS JOOD JURE T. In general, this type has a
small, flat head on a long neck; small eyes;
small horns, which may actually be either
ears or some form of breathing apparatus; a
mane; two or three dorsal humps; little or
no tail; and four webbed feet or paddles.
The animal is most often seen in warm
weather when the water surface is flat calm.
It can swim and dive swiftly.
(2) A serpentine freshwater animal similar
to Bernard Heuvelmans’s MULTIHUMPED
Sea MONSTER, often perceived only as a
string of humps or coils. The Canadian
MANIPOGO and OGOPOGO could be placed in
this category. This type has a serpentine
body and a long tail, and it usually swims
by vertical undulations.
(3) The European WtER HORSE appears to
be a freshwater form of Bernard
Heuvelmans’s MERHORSE. Its distinctive,
horselike head gives credence to the legend
that the animal can pass as a domestic
horse.
(4) Different types of large FISHES, especially
those that have the distinctive, razorback
scutes of a sturgeon along the spine.
Possible explanations:
(1) A surviving basilosaurid, a family of
archaic CETACEANS that lived 42-33 million
years ago in the Middle to Late Eocene,
could account for the serpentine type of
Freshwater monster. These animals
possessed torpedo-shaped bodies with
flexible vertebrae, elongated skulls, limber
necks, twin flippers derived from forelegs,
small dorsal fins, and long, fluked tails. The
hind limbs, about 2 feet long in Basilosaurus
isis, were reduced but functional. Nostrils
were placed at the top of the snout. Unlike
modern whales, their teeth were
differentiated into incisors, canines, and
molars. Basilosaurids came in a wide range
of sizes, 6-82 feet long. They are known to
have inhabited shallow coastal waters and
swamps as well as open oceans. Fossils have
been found in Egypt (especially the
Zeuglodon Valley), India, and North
America.
(2) A surviving plesiosaur matches the
morphology of many lake monsters. This
group of marine reptiles lived 238-65
million years ago and swam with paddlelike
limbs. Some, but not all, species had long
necks, and body length varied from 6 to 46
feet. The continuing evolution of a
surviving species from the Mesozoic might
account for such characteristics as cold-
weather adaptation, a freshwater habitat,
and the ability to crawl on land.
(3) An unknown, large, long-necked S E AL
(Suborder Pinnipedia) could account for
animals existing in cold, northern lakes.
This theory was first advanced for NESSIE by
the Dutch zoologist Anthonie Cornelis
Oudemans in 1935, based on his idea in the
1890s that most Sea MONSTER sightings
involved such an animal. However, the
fossil evidence is lacking. A seal would likely
be seen at the surface more often than most
lake monsters.
(4) Various species of Sturgeon (Family
Acipenseridae), large marine fishes with
several rows of dorsal plates, swim up rivers
into lakes for spawning and are likely
candidates for certain lake monsters.
(5) An unknown species of giant Freshwater
eel (Family Anguillidae) would account for
scarce surface sightings of serpentine
animals but is more problematic for the
humped variety.
(6) A surviving duck-billed DINOSAUR
(Family Hadrosauridae), one of the most
180 FRESHWATER MONSTERS
abundant types in North America in the
Late Cretaceous, 80 million years ago, was
suggested by Loren Coleman. These
browsing vegetarians often had bony head
crests that probably served as visual and
audible signaling devices. However, because
of their stiff tails, short toes, and small
hands, it’s unlikely they spent much of the
time in the water.
(7) Boat wakes, logs, swimming deer, and
other misidentifications.
(8) Mats of rotting vegetation.
(9) The Northern river otter ( Lontra
canadensis) and European otter ( Lutra lutra )
can appear mysterious to the untrained eye.
The otter’s streamlined body is almost
serpentine, and several animals swimming in
a row could simulate a monster from a
distance.
(10) Wayward Sharks (Subclass
Elasmobranchii) often travel many miles
upriver. In 1978, a shark was found in the
water intake of Edison’s Trenton Channel
Power Plant off the Detroit River in
Michigan.
(11) Wayward seals also migrate into
freshwater environments occasionally.
(12) A surviving Phobosuchus , a 50-foot
marine CROCODILIAN that lived in the
Cretaceous, 70 million years ago, has been
proposed by Mark A. Hall.
(13) A surviving mosasaur, such as Clidastes
propython , a marine reptile that lived 88-74
million years ago, also was suggested by
Mark A. Hall. It was about 12 feet long, ate
fishes and squid, and swam by horizontal
undulations. Fossils have been found in
Kansas and Alabama. Plotosaurus was nearly
three times as large (33 feet) and was also
found in Kansas. The end of its tail
extended into a vertical fin. Platecarpus ,
another Kansas mosasaur, was about 21 feet
long and died out at the end of the
Cretaceous.

Freshwater Octopus
Medium-sized CEPHAIOPOD occasionally found
in rivers of North America.
Physical description: Length, 2-3 feet.
Distribution: Licking River, Kentucky;
Kanawha and Blackwater Rivers, West Virginia;
Ohio River, at Louisville and Cincinnati.
Significant sightings: On December 24, 1933,
Robert Trice and R. M. Saunders were fishing
on the Kanawha River near Charleston, West
Virginia, when they hauled in a 3-foot octopus.
Recent research by Mark Hall has proven this
incident a hoax.
On January 30, 1959, a gray octopus was
seen surfacing and moving onto the bank of the
Licking River near Covington, Kentucky.
On November 19, 1999, a dead octopus was
found on the bank of the Ohio River at the Falls
of the Ohio State Park, Jeffersonville, Indiana,
on some fossil beds. It was identified as either a
Caribbean armstripe octopus ( Octopus burryi )
or a Bumblebee two-stripe octopus (O. filosus ),
both Atlantic species, and was not in a state of
decomposition. Both are available through
aquariums.
Present status: All known cephalopod species
are exclusively marine. Octopuses, even more
than squid, require high salinity levels.
Possible explanations:
(1) Discarded aquarium pets.
(2) Wandering, senescent individuals at the
end of their life cycle, though the Ohio
River is a bit far to stray in essentially toxic
water.
(3) An unknown species of octopus adapted
to a low-saline environment.

Furred Sea Monster
Sea MONSTERof the Indian and North Pacific
Oceans.
Physical description: Length, 25-47 feet. Cov-
ered in thick, white fur. Tapering head like an
elephant’s, 5 feet long. Trunklike appendage, 5
feet long and 14 inches in diameter. Tail, 14
feet long, beginning at the rib section.
Behavior: Fights with whales.
Distribution: The coasts of South Africa and
Alaska.
Significant sightings: On November 1, 1922,
Hugh Ballance saw two whales fighting with an
unusual animal some 1,300 yards off the shore
near Margate, KwaZulu-Natal Province, South
Africa. Through binoculars, it looked like a
huge polar bear with a tail with which it struck
the whales repeatedly. Crowds of people
watched the battle for three hours until the
monster was killed. The next night, the carcass
washed ashore and lay on the beach for ten days.
It had an elephant’s trunk and was covered in
snow-white hair.
In November 1930, the carcass of a 25-foot
animal with a long and tapering head washed up
on Glacier Island, Alaska. W. J. McDonald, su-
pervisor of the Chugach National Forest, and
six others examined the body, which had very
little flesh left on it. The widest part of the skele-
ton was 3 feet 2 inches. Its weight was estimated
at 1,000 pounds.
Possible explanations:
(1) A decomposing shark or whale, where
the dried-out, fibrous connective tissue
looks like white fur.
(2) An unknown marine mammal,
completely unlike anything else in the fossil
record.

182 FURRED SEA MONSTER
G
Gabon Orangutan
Mystery PRIMATE of Central Africa.
Variant name: AIZ 6624 (specimen catalog
number).
Physical description: An unusually small vari-
ety of chimpanzee. Weight, 6 pounds. Dark,
gray-brown skin on face, ears, back, and lateral
portion of limbs. High, hairless forehead. Small
face. Protuberant eyes. Narrow nose. Hands and
feet small in relation to the body. Lacks thumbs
and big toes.
Behavior: Said to travel in a group of 100.
Distribution: Gabon.
Significant sighting: A specimen was obtained in
August 1957 by Phillip J. Carroll and sent to the
Anthropological Institute of the University of
Zurich. It had fallen froma tree, injured itself, and
died three weeks later. Carroll claimed it was with
a group of 100 other chimps of the same size.
Probable explanation: The individual was a
young Chimpanzee ( Pan troglodytes) with severe
deformities of the skull and skeleton.

Gabriel Feather
A single Bird feather housed in El Escorial
Palace near Madrid, Spain.
Etymology: Said to have come froma wing of
the Archangel Gabriel.
Physical description: A rose-colored feather of
extraordinary beauty.
Present status: Acquired by El Escorial some-
time after the palace was built between 1563
and 1584 by King Philip II. Seen in 1787 by
William Beckford. Apparently, the Monastery
of San Lorenzo at the palace no longer owns this
relic.
Possible explanations:
(1) A feather of the Resplendent quetzal
( Pharomachrus mocinno) of Central America,
a bird of the Trogon family sacred to the
Aztec and Maya Indians and famous for its
plumage. But the prized wing and tail
feathers of the male are green, not rose.
(2) A plume from one of New Guinea’s
Birds of paradise (Family Paradisaeidae).
Survivors of Ferdinand Magellan’s voyage
around the world took back to Portugal
skins of these birds obtained from the
island’s inhabitants in 1522. Count Raggi’s
bird of paradise ( Paradisea raggiand) has
rose-colored plumes, which Karl Shuker
suggests might account for the Gabriel
feather.

Gabriel Hound
BLACK Dog of northern England.
Etymology: First recorded around 1665. Orig-
inally, a spectral dog in a pack led by the pre-
Christian spirits Herne or Gwyn that escorted
souls to the underworld; in Christian folklore,
the pack was transferred to the care of the
183
Archangel Gabriel. An alternate explanation is
that the word is derived from an ancient word,
gabbara (“dead body”).
Variant names: Gabble ratchet, Gabriel
ratchet, Skyyelper.
Physical description: Huge dog with a human
head. Sometimes described as a spectral bird
with glowing eyes.
Behavior: Makes eerie howls. Said to travel
high in the air and hover over a house when
misfortune is about to occur.
Distribution: Lancashire, Derbyshire, and
Cleveland, England.
Possible explanation: It is said that the sound
of migrating Bean geese ( Anser fabalis) flapping
their wings can be mistaken for the baying of a
pack of these hounds. The howling or “gab-
bling” sounds might also be produced by a
Curlew ( Numenius arquata :), Eurasian wigeon
{Anas penelope ), or Eurasian teal {Anas crecca).

Gally-Trot
BLACK Dog of southern England.
Etymology: Possibly from the French gardez le
tresor (“guard the treasure”); from gaily
(“frighten”) + the German Trotsch (“spirit”); or
from the Frisian glay or gley (“shining”) + Trotsch.
Variant names: Galley trot, Hound of the hill,
White hound of Cator.
Physical description: Size of a bullock. White,
shaggy coat. Red ears.
Behavior: Chases people who try to run away
from it.
Habitat: Lives in hollow hills.
Distribution: Norfolk and Suffolk; Leek
Brook, Staffordshire; Pluckley, Kent; Welling-
ton, Somerset; Bunbury, Cheshire; Dartmoor,
Devon.

Gambo
Sea Monster of West Africa.
Etymology: Coined by Karl Shuker after the
name of the country, The Gambia.
Variant name: Kunthum belein (Mandinka
word for dolphin, literally “cutting jaws”).
Physical description: Smooth, scaleless skin.
Length, 15 feet. Width, 5 feet. Dark brown on
top, white below. Dolphinlike head. Small,
brown eyes. Jaws, 18 inches in length, with
eighty sharp, conical, uniform teeth. No blow-
hole. Nostrils are at the tip of the jaws. Short
neck. No dorsal fin. Four paddle-shaped flip-
pers, each 18 inches long. Pointed tail, 5 feet
long. No flukes.
Distribution: Kotu, The Gambia.
Significant sighting: On June 12, 1983, Owen
Burnham discovered the carcass of an odd sea
creature washed up on the beach near the Bun-
galow Beach Hotel at Kotu. Local people were
in the process of cutting off the head to sell
when he found it.
Possible explanations:
(1) The combination of four paddles, eighty
teeth, lack of scales and blowhole, and long
tail rules out seals, known cetaceans,
sirenians, modern reptiles, and fishes.
(2) Fossil archaic basilosaurid whales only
had forty teeth.
(3) Shepherd’s beaked whale {Tasmacetus
shepherdi ) matches somewhat in coloration,
but it has a blowhole, tail flukes, a dorsal
fin, a much shorter beak, no nostrils, and
no pelvic flippers. In addition, this rare
cetacean prefers the cold water of New
Zealand and the South Atlantic.
(4) A surviving pliosaur, a member of a
group of short-necked plesiosaurs with large
heads, elongated jaws with massive teeth,
1 84 GALLY-TROT
Gambo, an odd sea monster that washed up on the beach in Gambia in 1983. (William M. Rebsamen)
two sets of flippers, and pointed tails. In
some larger species such as Kronosaurus
queens landicus (over 40 feet), the skull was
as much as 10 feet long. These marine
reptiles lived 200-65 million years ago
(from the Early Jurassic to the end of the
Creta ceous) , swa m underwa ter
aerodynamically like penguins, and were
probably pursuit predators.
(5) A surviving mosasaur, a group of twenty
genera that included some of the largest
marine reptiles ever, frequently exceeding
33 feet in length. They lived in the Late
Cretaceous, 95-65 million years ago, and
had large, conical teeth, each set in a deep
socket. The plioplatecarpines and
tylosa urines had short bodies and long,
narrow tails.
(6) A surviving metriorhynchid archosaur, a
member of a group of thalattosuchians with
flippers, no dermal armor, and an expansion
at the end of the tail. These reptiles lived
200-95 million years ago, from the Early
Jurassic to the Late Cretaceous. Like
mosasaurs, they moved through the water
by undulating trunk and tail.
(7) A surviving ichthyosaur, a group of
dolphinlike reptiles with narrow, pointed
snouts and spindle-shaped bodies. They
lived 245-65 million years ago, from the
Early Triassic to the end of the Cretaceous,
reaching their greatest size (about 48 feet) in
the Late Triassic. The ichthyosaur had big
eyes, nostrils placed well back from the tip
of the snout, a dorsal fin, and a fishlike tail
that did all the work of moving the animal
through the water.
(8) A surviving champsosaur, a freshwater,
crocodile-like animal with a flat skull and
slender snout that lived from the Late
Cretaceous to the Oligocene, 70-30 million
years ago. It had well-ossified limbs and
could probably walk on land.

Ganba
Mythical giant SNAKE of Australia.
Etymology: Miming (Australian) word.
Variant name: Jeedarra.
Physical description: Huge size.
Behavior: The gurgling sound of under-
ground streams is said to be caused by its breath.
Seizes and eats people.
Habitat: Underground caves; also the ocean.
Distribution: Nullarbor Plain, South Aus-
tralia.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Amethystine python ( Morelia
amethystine i) of Cape York, Queensland, is
Australia’s largest snake. Average specimens
are 1 5 feet long, though outsize individuals
attain nearly 24 feet. Its scales have an
iridescent sheen. However, this snake
strictly lives in the forest.
(2) The Taipan ( Oxyuranus scutellatus) , one
of Australia’s most dangerous snakes, is
found along the coast of Queensland and
the Kimberley region.

Gargouille
Legendary DRAGON of France.
Etymology: French, “gargler.”
Variant name: Gargoyle.
Physical description: Serpentine. Scaly head.
Slender snout. Eyes that gleam like moonstones.
Long neck. Four membranous flippers.
Behavior: Shoots jets of water from its mouth.
Lives in a cave on the riverbank. Capsizes boats.
Eats people.
Distribution: Seine River in Normandy,
France.
Significant sighting: A scaly monster emerged
from the Seine River near Rouen, France, in the
early seventh century and caused flooding by
emitting jets of water from its mouth. It was
subdued by St. Romain (Romanus), archbishop
of Rouen (from A.D. 626 to 640), who led it
back to town, where it was burned to death.
Present status: Served as the inspiration for the
architectural gargoyles that began to adorn
French churches in the thirteenth century as wa-
terspouts.

Garuda
Flying Humanoid or bird of the Indian sub-
continent. In Hindu mythology, it is the king of
the birds and is identified with fire and the sun.
Etymology: Sanskrit (Indo-Aryan) word.
Variant names: Garutmat, Gerda (in
Malaysia), Kruth (in Cambodia), Nagantaka
(“destroyer of snakes”), Sitanana (“white face”),
Taraswin, Vinayaka (“destroyer of obstacles”).
Physical description: Large bird with human
arms and legs. Said to be as bright as the sun. Its
white face is half human, half bird. Golden or
green body feathers. Scarlet wings.
Behavior: Enemy of snakes (Naga).
Distribution: India; Southeast Asia.
Present status: In Hindu mythology, this en-
tity is the vehicle of the god Vishnu. Earlier de-
pictions show the Garuda as an eaglelike bird;
later artwork makes it more human. In Indone-
sia, the Garuda has survived modernization to
become the national emblem.
Possible explanation: The Brahminy kite
{H alias tur indus) is a common hawk found from
India east to the Solomon Islands. It has a dis-
tinctive, deep-chestnut color and a white head
and neck. Length, 20 inches. Hindus consider it
a sacred bird associated with Garuda.

Gauarge
Mythical F RESHmiER MONSTER of Australia.
Etymology: Australian word.
Physical description: Like a featherless emu.
Behavior: Drags bathers down into a
whirlpool.
Habitat: Water holes.
Possible explanation: Folk memory or extrapo-
lation based on fossils of an Australian theropod
dinosaur such as Kakuru, which lived in the
Early Cretaceous, 110 million years ago, in
South Australia.

Genaprugwirion
Mystery LIZARD of Wales.
Etymology: From Welsh genau (“mouth”) +
pryf(“ insect”) + gwirion (“silly”) = “silly insect-
eater” (?).
Variant name: Cenaprugwirion.
Physical description: Length, 12 inches.
Muddy-brown color. Head is the size of an or-
ange. Pronounced dewlap. Long tongue.
Behavior: Rolls its eyes continually. Lives in a
burrow, poking its head out to catch flies or in-
sects.
Distribution: Aber Soch, Lleyn Peninsula,
Gwynedd, Wales.
Present status: Now rare but said to be com-
mon long ago.
Possible explanations:
(1) Naturalized population of a nonnative
lizard, such as an Iguana (Family
Iguanidae), Agama (Family Agamidae),
Skink (Family Scincidae), or Chameleon
(Family Chamaeleonidae) . However, the
Welsh climate is not suitable for a sustained
population of these tropical lizards.
(2) Karl Shuker has suggested a naturalized
population of Tuataras ( Sphenodon
punctatus or S. guntheri ) of New Zealand,
lizardlike reptiles that were often kept as
exotic pets in the nineteenth century. Adults
measure 1 6-26 inches long and have such a
low metabolic rate that they can go an hour
without breathing and subsist indefinitely
on two earthworms a week. Their
maximum life expectancy in the wild could
be 100 years or more. Able to withstand a
temperate climate, the Tuatara is the last
living representative of the Order
Sphenodontida and is now confined to
about twenty small islands off the northeast
coast of New Zealand and in Cook Strait.

Sphenodonts were once widespread, and
fossils from the Late Triassic through the

Giant Anaconda
Individual SNAKE or a separate species of ana-
conda of South America that exceeds the ac-
cepted length of 30 feet.
Variant names: Boiuba, Boiuna, Camoodi,
Cobra-grande, Controller, Ibibaboka, Lam-
palagua (in Argentina), Matatora (Spanish,
“bull-killer”), SACHAMAMA, Sucuriju gigante
(Portuguese, “giant anaconda”), Yaurinka.
Physical description: Length, 40-150 feet. Dark-
chestnut color. Diameter, more than 2 feet 6
inches. Weight, up to 5 tons. Triangular head.
Two horns above the eyes. Large eyes glow phos-
phorescent blue at night. Off-white spots on belly.
Behavior: Semiaquatic. A swift swimmer.
Creates a huge wake.
Tracks: Wide furrow through the swamp,
with trees pushed up.
Distribution: Amazon River basin, Brazil; less
credible reports are from Argentina, Venezuela,
and Guyana.
Significant sightings: Explorer Percy H. Faw-
cett shot a 62-foot anaconda on the Rio Abuna,
Acre State, Brazil, near the Peruvian border, in
January 1907. However, its largest diameter was
12 inches, which seems small for the length.
Fr. Victor Heinz saw a giant water snake on
the Amazon near Alenquer, Brazil, on October
29, 1929. Its blue-green, phosphorescent eyes
were at first mistaken for a riverboat’s lights.
A photo made into a postcard shows a 105-
foot snake with shining eyes that was reportedly
killed by the Brazilian Boundary Commission
on the frontier with Venezuela in 1932. It was
said to be 4 feet thick. No hint of the snake’s

size is provided, though three out-of-focus hu-
mans can be seen in the background.
Another photo taken in 1948 or 1949 by
Joaquim Alencar shows a huge snake, variously
said to be 115 or 147 feet long, floating on the
Rio Abuna, Acre State, Brazil.
In 1977, Amarilho Vincente de Oliveira saw
a giant snake with horns and greenish eyes on a
tributary of the Rio Purus, Brazil.
Present status: The record length for an ana-
conda of 37 feet 6 inches, reported in 1939 or
1940 by Robert Lamon, is not universally ac-
cepted. John Murphy and Robert Henderson
point out that enormous snakes have fewer
places in which to hide from predators, and
their great size would cause problems with
maintaining blood pressure in the tail. After
surveying the ratio of minimum adult length to
the record length of many snake species, Peter
Pritchard has concluded that the maximum
length of a snake is 1.5-2. 5 times its shortest
adult length; small anacondas are 10-12 feet
long, making the largest theoretical length 30
feet. Aaron Bauer estimates that Fawcett’s 62-
foot snake had to have been at least 30 inches in
diameter and spend virtually all its time in the
water.
Possible explanations:
(1) Skins of normal-sized Anacondas
( Eunectes murinus) are often dried and
stretched, resulting in a much greater
length. Even a skin that is not stretched can
be 10-20 percent longer than the live snake.
(2) Field estimates are often unreliable,
especially for snakes that are partially
submerged.
(3) An unknown species of anaconda that
normally attains such lengths.
(4) Reports of horns might be caused by
protruding eyes, fleshy outgrowths caused
by an injury, or barlike markings on the
head.

drops on all fours and uses the edges of its front
feet.
Tracks: Gorilla-like. Five toes. Length, 5.5
inches.
Distribution: Magaliesberg Range, near Preto-

Africa, apparently shows a battle between
Khoisan people wielding spears and apelike
creatures using stones as weapons.
A gorilla-like ape was seen several times near
Outjo, Namibia, in November 1959.
Possible explanations:
(1) An out-of-place Gorilla {Gorilla gorilla)',
the nearest of these animals live 1,000 miles
away in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo. However, it’s unlikely that a zoo
escapee would have gone unnoticed. The
arid environment of Namibia would be
inhospitable for a forest ape.
(2) Surviving australopiths, whose fossils
have been found in the region around
Johannesburg. Australopiths were a family
of Pliocene fossil hominids that persisted
into the Early Pleistocene, 4.4— 1.4 million
years ago. They had apelike skulls, hominid
teeth and projecting jaws, and an upright,
bipedal gait, although they apparently also
climbed trees.

Giant Aye-Aye
Mystery PRIM ATE of Madagascar.
Distribution: Northwestern Madagascar.
Significant sighting: An exceptionally large aye-
aye skin was found around 1 930 by a government
official named Hourcq at a native’s home near
Andranomavo, Soalala District, Madagascar.
Possible explanation: A surviving fossil lemur,
Daubentonia robusta, that was probably contem-
poraneous with humans. It was three to five
times heavier than the living Aye-aye ( D . mada-
gascariensis) • No skull has yet been found, but
postcranial bones are larger and much more ro-
bust than those of the living form. Teeth perfo-
rated for stringing offer direct evidence that the
animal was hunted by humans, and it is virtually
certain that this species was driven to extinction
by human action in the past 2,000 years.

Giant Beaver
Legend of a large, beaverlike RODENT in eastern
Canada.
Physical description: Not much information is
available from the Native American legends,
even on size. However, the animal must have
been larger than the American beaver ( Castor
canadensis ), which is about 2 feet-2 feet 6 inches
long, with a 10-inch tail.
Distribution: Labrador, New Brunswick, and
Nova Scotia. Mishtamishku-shipu (Giant
Beaver River), Labrador, 54°40' N, 62°25' W,
was named for the animals that were killed
there, according to the local Montagnais-
Naskapi people.
Significant sighting: The Giant beaver created
much damage with its huge dams. The Indian
folk hero Gluskap set out to destroy it but
wound up chasing it further west.
Possible explanation: Surviving Giant beaver
( Cast oroides ohioensis ), a large North American
beaver that ranged from the Yukon south to
Florida and from New York west to Nebraska
and apparently died out 10,000 years ago. It was
7 feet 6 inches long and may have weighed 440
pounds. Its cutting teeth were 6 inches long,
with strong enamel ridges. The tail was appar-
ently round, not fiat.

Giant British Octopus
Large CEPHAIOPOD of the North Atlantic
Ocean.
Physical description: Octopus with arms 6 feet
or more in length.
Distribution: Western coast of Scotland and
Cornwall.
Significant sighting: On January 12, 1952,
Constable John Morrison came across a
cephalopod lying half out of the water near
Broadford, Isle of Skye, Scotland. He gave it a
hefty kick, but it gripped him by the left ankle
with a 6-foot tentacle. Morrison slipped out of
his boot and eventually killed the animal with
rocks and garden shears. It was later identified as
a Red flying squid ( Ommastrephes bartrami ), ap-
parently an occasional visitor to Britain.
Possible explanation: The Common octopus
( Octopus vulgaris) has an average radial size of
1-2 feet, but outsize specimens with a radial
spread of just over 6 feet have been reported in
British waters.

Giant Bushbaby
Unknown PRIMATE of Central and West Africa.
Physical description: Large galago (also known
as a bushbaby) the size of a cat. Pale-gray fur.
Distribution: Cameroon; Cote d’Ivoire;
Senegal.
Significant sightings: Owen Burnham saw a
Giant bushbaby accompanied by some young
ones in Casamance Lorest, Senegal, in June
1985.
A specimen was photographed in Cameroon
in 1994 by an assistant of zoologist Simon K.
Bearder.
Present status: Greater galagos (Otolemur spp.)
are not known in Cameroon. The largest, al-
most cat-sized at 1 5 inches in length not count-
ing the tail, is the Silver galago (O. argentatus),
found only in Kenya. Smaller galagos, especially
the Senegal galago ( Galago senegalensis) , which
has a body length of only 6.5 inches, do occur
in Cameroon.

192 GIANT BEAVER
Giant Centipede
Oversized segmented INVERTEBRATE of Mis-
souri and Arkansas.
Physical description: Length, 7-18 inches.
Arthropod with multiple legs.
Behavior: Female wraps itself around newly
hatched young.
Distribution: Ozark Mountains near
Gainesville, Bradleyville, Stone County, and
Taney County, Missouri; Marion County,
Arkansas.
Significant sighting: S. C. Turnbo collected
stories of large centipedes in the Ozarks in the
mid-nineteenth century. An 18-inch centipede
was said to have been captured alive by Bent
Music on Jimmie’s Creek in Marion County,
Arkansas, in 1860. It was placed in a jar of alco-
hol in a drugstore in Yellville, but people lost
track of it during the Civil War.
Possible explanation: The largest known
species of centipede in North America is the
Giant desert centipede ( Scolopendra heros ), a
black- and-orange banded animal with yellow
legs that grows to more than 8 inches. It is
found in Mexico and the southern United
States. Females guard their hatchlings closely for
a few days after birth. A related species, the
Galapagos centipede ( S . galapagensis) , is the
largest in the world, growing to 17 inches.

Giant Cookiecutter Shark
Unknown FlSH of the North Pacific Ocean.
Behavior: Takes large circular bites out of
whales and dolphins.
Distribution: Arctic waters off Alaska.
Significant sighting: While working in Alaska,
a colleague of Eugenie Clark reported that a
dead Narwhal (. Monodon monoceros) was pulled
up alongside their research boat for examination
one night. In the morning, as the scientists
began to examine it, they found round bites on
the animal that strongly resembled those left by
the Cookiecutter sharks (Isistius spp.). However,
they were much bigger than bites made by
known cookiecutters.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Cookiecutter shark ( Isistius
brasiliensis) and the Largetooth cookiecutter
shark (I. plutodul) are both subtropical
species. Neither grows much longer than
1 8-20 inches. The cookiecutter clamps
onto the flesh of its much larger prey with
its jaws and bites down with the sharp teeth
on its lower jaw to extract circular chunks of
flesh. Tunas, elephant seals, dolphins, whales,
swordfish, and other large marine animals
have been found with large gouges that were
probably inflicted by this shark. A giant
species of cookiecutter would theoretically
take much larger bites.
(2) The Pacific sleeper shark ( Somniosus
pacificus) frequently scavenges whale
carcasses.
(3) The Greenland shark ( Somniosus
micro cephalus) also leaves razor-edged,
circular bites on narwhals and seals.

Loose, gray skin. Dorsal crest. Huge, clawed,
three-toed feet.
Distribution: Ethiopia.

terviewed a big-game hunter who said he had
come across a large, lizardlike animal, about
10-12 feet long, on the border of Ethiopia and
Sudan.

GIANT ETHIOPIAN LIZARD 193
GIANT HOMINIDS
In this category are humanlike, hairy creatures
that are described as 6 feet 6 inches tall or
greater. Their bipedal gait, appearance, and be-
havior indicate a closer relationship to humans
(HOMINIDS) than to the apes (PRIMATES).
The only known fossil that comes close to
giant status is Gigantopithecus , a huge ape first
recognized by Dutch anthropologist G. H. R.
von Koenigswald from a single molar he pur-
chased in a Hong Kong pharmacy in 1935.
Since then, more than 1,000 other teeth and a
few mandibles have been recovered. There are
two known species, G. blacki of China and Viet-
nam and G. giganteus of India. G. giganteus is
older and smaller, dating from the Late
Miocene, 9—6 million years ago. By the time G.
blacki roamed East Asia in the Early and Middle
Pleistocene, 1 million-400,000 years ago, Gi-
gantopithecus had become extremely robust.
One estimate puts its height at 9-10 feet tall
and its weight at 900-1,200 pounds. However,
no weight-bearing bones have been recovered,
and it is possible that the animal’s teeth and jaws
were disproportionate to its body size.
Another von Koenigswald discovery involved
two large fossil mandibles recovered in Java in
1939 and 1941. Designated Meganthropus
palaeojavanicus, the specimens were described
by German anatomist Franz Weidenreich only
from casts that von Koenigswald made and sent
to Beijing before he was captured and interred
by the Japanese during World War II. A hand-
ful of other fragmentary finds have been in-
cluded in this taxon, but there is no consensus
on the creature’s status. Many regard it as be-
longing to Homo erectus, though some consider
it pathologically oversized.
Legends of a race of giants are found in many
cultures, making it all the more strange that the
known hominid fossil record is so sparse. The
Cyclops of Greece, Geendel of the Anglo-
Saxons, and the Nehiim in the Book of Genesis
are examples of this rich tradition of ancient gi-
ants. However, many legends were based on the
discovery of fossil elephants and other extinct
megafauna; the ancient Greeks and Romans
tended to identify huge skulls and femurs with
various mythical heroes, even if they were not
particularly human-looking. Still, persistent re-
ports of the discovery of GlANTHUMAN SKELE-
TONS have come from both Europe and North
America.
According to the Guinness Book of Records,
the tallest man in medical history was Robert
Pershing Wadlow (1918-1940) of Alton, Illi-
nois, who measured 8 feet 11.1 inches shortly
before his death. He weighed 491 pounds on his
twenty-first birthday.
Modern Giant hominids have been reported
from every continent except Antarctica. BlG-
FOOTof the Pacific Northwest is probably the
most familiar variety. Interestingly, a diverse tra-
dition of hairy giants also occurs in Siberia, the
logical origination for hominids migrating into
North America.
True Giants constitute a subcategory of
Giant hominids 10 feet or more tall.

Significant sightings: The earliest known dis-
covery of giant’s bones was near Ale a, Arcadia,
Greece, about 560 B.G, when a blacksmith un-
covered a 1 0-foot-long coffin containing a huge
skeleton. Hailed as the bones of the Spartan
hero Orestes, they were reburied in that city
with great honor. Some scholars think they were
the fossil remains of large animals, discovered
and interred in a coffin at a much earlier time.
Adrienne Major calls Herodotus’s account of
this event the earliest fossil measurement ever
recorded.
In 1509, some workers digging ditches near
Rouen, France, uncovered a stone tomb that
contained the skeleton of a man of enormous
size. The skull was large enough to hold a bushel
of corn, and the shinbone measured 4 feet in
length; from this, the full height was estimated
at 17 feet. On the tomb was a copper plate that
identified the body as Chevalier Ricon de Valle-
mont.
From the 1860s to the 1880s, settlers in Min-
nesota digging into Indian mounds excavated
human skeletons 7-8 feet tall. In December
1868, quarry workers at Sauk Rapids found a
petrified skeleton 10 feet 9.5 inches tall in a
grave chamber capped by a limestone slab about
7 feet below the surface. The skull was flat on
the top and measured 31.5 inches in circumfer-
ence. The femur was 26.25 inches long, and the
fibula was 25.5 inches.
A skeleton measuring 8 feet in length was dis-
covered by George B. Dresbach Jr. while level-
ing an earthwork near Dresbach, Minnesota, in
the nineteenth century.
Four skeletons of men 7-9 feet tall were un-
earthed in two mounds near Salem, West Vir-
ginia, in 1930. However, by the time anthro-
pologist D. T. Stewart reached the site, most of
the bones had disintegrated or become lost. The
few remaining bones were considered to be only
average size.
In 1965, Kenneth White dug up a perfectly
preserved skeleton under a rock ledge near
Holly Creek, Kentucky, that was 8 feet 9 inches
tall when reassembled. Its arms were relatively
long, its hands large, and its feet relatively small.
The skull was 30 inches in circumference. The
GIANT HUMAN SKELETONS 195
eye and nose sockets were slits instead of cavi-
ties. The jawbone was solidly fused to the skull.
Folklorist Michael Henson was able to examine
the skeleton before it was reburied by White.
In August 1965, physician Robert W. Den-
ton discovered the top portion of an unusual
skull in a boggy area in the Minarets Wilderness
in northern California. It was examined by Ger-
ald K. Ridge, a pathologist at the Ventura
County General Hospital, and by University of
California, Los Angeles (UCLA) archaeologists
Herman Bleibtreul and Jack Prost. The nuchal
ridge was unusally developed, leading Ridge to
think it was not human. The specimen has since
been misplaced, although, according to Matt
Moneymaker, it may be languishing unidenti-
fied in UCLA’s off-campus museum annex in
Chatsworth.
Present status: Most reports are old, uncon-
firmed, and of dubious provenance, but they are
nonetheless intriguing as possible physical evi-
dence for BlGFOOTor other GlANTHOMINIDS.
Possible explanations:
(1) Two diseases caused by oversecretion of
the human growth hormone (HGH) by the
pituitary gland can result in enlarged body
size. Acromegaly, a disorder usually caused
by a benign pituitary tumor, is marked by
gradual and permanent enlargement of the
jaw, hands, feet, internal organs, nose, lips,
and tongue. In most cases, onset occurs
between the ages of thirty and fifty after
normal bone growth has stopped, resulting
in bones that become deformed rather than
elongated. Overgrowth in the jaw causes it
to protrude, and the ribs thicken, creating a
barrel chest. Much rarer is gigantism, which
begins abruptly in childhood before the end
plates of the long bones have closed. The
condition leads to exaggerated bone growth
and abnormal height (with a growth rate of
as much as 6 inches per year). Afflicted
adults may reach a height of more than 6
feet 8 inches.
(2) The unearthing of mastodon bones and
other megafaunal remains undoubtedly
contributed to many of these accounts.

Giant Hyrax of Shaanxi
Unknown H YRAX of East Asia.
Physical description: A stocky quadruped with
a head like a hyrax’s, single hooves, and a short,
hippopotamus-like tail.
Distribution: Shaanxi Province, China.
Significant sighting: Chinese bronze statuettes,
at least one of which is from Shaanxi Province
and dates from the Period of Warring States
(403-221 B.c), depict this animal.
Present status: Presumably extinct.
Possible explanation: Pliohyrax, a hyrax about
the size of a large pig that lived in China 2 mil-
lion years ago, in the Late Pliocene. It is only
known from fossil skulls, but the eye placement
indicates a semiaquatic adaptation similar to
that of the hippopotamus. However, modern
hyraxes have hooflike nails, not hooves, and
Pliohyrax was probably no different — unless it
evolved a padded foot structure that was imper-
fectly conveyed by the sculptor.

Giant Jellyfish
Unknown marine INVERTEBRATE.
Distribution: North Atlantic and South Pa-
cific Oceans.
Significant sightings: In 1953, an Australian
deep-sea diver watched a shapeless, brown mass
engulf a shark.
Divers Richard Winer and Pat Boatwright
encountered a huge jellyfish, 50-100 feet in di-
ameter, when they were diving 14 miles south-
west of Bermuda in November 1969. It was
deep purple with a pinkish outer rim.
In January 1973, in the South Pacific be-
tween Australia and Fiji, the Australian ship Ku-
randa collided with a colossal jellyfish that
draped itself over the forecastle head. One crew
member came too close to one of the flailing
tentacles and died from the sting. Capt. Langley
Smith estimated that some of the tentacles were
200 feet long and that the deck was covered in
a slimy mass 2 feet deep. An SOS eventually
brought a deep-sea salvage tugboat, the Her-
cules, to the rescue, and the animal was dis-
lodged with the aid of high-pressure hoses. Sam-
ples of the remaining substance on the deck
were analyzed in Sydney and tentatively identi-
fied as a lion’s mane jelly.
Possible explanation: The largest known jelly-
fish is the Lion’s mane jelly ( Cyanea capillatd)
found in the North Atlantic and North Pacific
Oceans, most often in shallow coastal waters.
Large individuals are deep-red or purple in
color, while smaller ones are more yellow or
brown. The nematocysts produce painful stings
but are not usually fatal. One specimen exam-
ined in 1865 by Alexander Agassiz in Massa-
chusetts Bay had a bell measuring 7 feet 6 inches
across and tentacles stretching 120 feet long.

GIANT JELLYFISH 197
Giant Kangaroo
Mystery MARSUP IALof Australia.
Variant name: Kuperree.
Distribution: Eyre Peninsula, South Australia.
Significant sighting: The Aborigines of Port
Lincoln had a legend of the extinction of a
Giant kangaroo named Kuperree.
Possible explanation: The Eastern gray kanga-
roo (. Macropus giganteus) was much larger dur-
ing the Late Pleistocene, perhaps twice as mas-
sive. Specimens now grow no greater than a
body length of 5 feet, with a tail at least 3 feet
long. Buried in a swamp near Lancefield, Victo-
ria, are the remains of thousands of giant
Macropus fossils that died about 26,000 years
ago.

Possible explanation: The Giant Malagasy tor-
toise (Geochelone grandidieri), an extinct turtle
with a carapace 4 feet long, may have persisted
until the 1940s.

Giant Mediterranean Octopus
Large CEPHMOPOD of the Mediterranean Sea.
Variant names: Hydra, Scylla.
Physical description: Octopus with arms
longer than 10 feet.
Distribution: Mediterranean Sea off France
and Greece.
Significant sightings: A large octopus might
have inspired the Greek myths of the six-
necked, twelve-footed, cave-dwelling sea crea-
ture Scylla that attacked Odysseus’s crew in the
Strait of Messina, Italy, or the nine-headed, ser-
pentine Hydra that Herakles killed in the
marshes of Lerna south of Argos in the Pelo-
ponnesus, Greece.
An octopus with arms 13 feet long was re-
ported in 1912 off Toulon, France.
Sometime in the 1950s, a diver encountered
a huge octopus either in the Gulf of Corinth or
off Piraieus in the Aegean Sea.
Possible explanation: The Common octopus
(' Octopus vulgaris) has an average radial size of
1-2 feet, but outsize specimens with spans of
8-9 feet are known. Reports of sizes greater than
this are sparse and vague.

Giant North American Lizard
Large, unknown LIZARDS of North America.
Variant names: Canip monster lizard, Cross-
wick monster, Giant pink lizard, GOWKT^
Mini-rex, Mountain boomer, River dino, River
lizard.
Physical description: Various sizes and descrip-
tions.
Behavior: Some are bipedal, others quadru-
pedal.
Tracks: Three- or four-toed.
Distribution: British Columbia, Canada; Col-
orado; Texas; South Dakota; Ohio; Kentucky;
Pennsylvania.
Significant sightings: Prior to 1820, when a
198 GIANT KANGAROO
drought exterminated them, pink lizards 3-8
feet long were said to inhabit “Catlick Creek
Valley,” which Mark Hall has identified as
Scippo Creek in Pickaway County, Ohio. The
animals were said to have horns like a cow’s.
In the late nineteenth century, two young
boys fishing in a stream near Crosswick, Ohio,
were attacked by a lizard that stood 12-16 feet
tall. Three men rescued the boy, but the lizard
escaped into a huge hollow tree. Later in the
day, townsfolk came to cut the tree down, but
the animal ran away on its two hind legs.
Myrtle Snow claimed to have seen five “baby
dinosaurs” near Chromo, Colorado, in May
1935 when she was three years old. John Mar-
tinez had shot one a few months earlier after it
killed some sheep. It was 7 feet tall, gray, had a
head like a snake’s, short front legs with claws,
large hind legs, and a long tail. Snow saw simi-
lar animals near a cave in 1937 and October
1978.
Several reports of smallish, bipedal lizards
have come from Vancouver and Texada Islands,
British Columbia. In one instance, railroad
workers came across a nest of 12-inch-tall lizards
that scampered away on two legs.
In July 1975, there were several sightings of a
large, black-and-white-striped lizard with a red,
forked tongue near Canip Creek in Trimble
County, Kentucky. It left clawed tracks that
were 5 inches long by 4.5 inches wide. Clarence
and Garrett Cable saw it on three occasions in a
junkyard near Milton. It appeared to be about
1 5 feet long.
In 1981, a 2-foot, green, crested lizard was
chased by some boys along a railroad track in
New Kensington, Pennsylvania.
In the early 1990s, Jimmy Ward investigated
rumors of a green or brown, bipedal lizard with
a booming voice in west Texas near the Big
Bend National Park. It was called the Moun-
tain boomer and stood 5-6 feet tall on its hind
legs.
In 2000, Ron Schaffner obtained some pho-
tos showing small, dinosaur-like lizards allegedly
taken in the Fountain Creek, Colorado, area,
but the animals might well be rubber models.
Possible explanations:
(1) Unknown monitor lizards (Family
Varanidae), though existing species are
known only from Africa, Asia, and
Australasia.
(2) Surviving Matthewichnus caudifer, a
fossil amphibian whose tracks are known
from the Carboniferous period, 300 million
years ago, in Tennessee, suggested by Mark
Hall.
(3) A neotenic Mole salamander
(Amby stoma spp.), also suggested by Hall.
However, this overgrown, underdeveloped
larva (axolotl) does not leave the water.
(4) Escaped pet Colombian black-and-white
tegu ( Tupinambis teguixiri) , which looks
somewhat like a monitor lizard and grows
to 4 feet long, suggested by Chad Arment
for the Canip Creek animal.
(5) Escaped pet Green basilisk ( Basiliscus
plumifrons ), a bright-green, arboreal lizard
from Central America that grows to 3 feet
and has a banded tail and dorsal crest,
suggested by Chad Arment for the New
Kensington lizard.
(6) The Eastern collared lizard ( Crotaphytus
co llaris co llaris) is, for unknown reasons, also
called the Mountain boomer, though it has
no vocal cords. A Western subspecies (C. c.
baileyi ) is found in the Big Bend area and
grows to about 2 feet in length. It runs on
its hind legs.

Significant sightings: In January or February
1871, a snake 38 feet 9 inches long and 43
inches in circumference was killed near Fredo-
nia, Kansas. However, in the nineteenth cen-
tury, Kansas was widely regarded as an area for
exaggeration and tall tales.
A dead snake 13 feet 6 inches long was found
behind the Clyde Myers home near Doyles-
town, Ohio, on May 1, 1944. It was 6 inches in
diameter and had bent and broken the tall grass
in an area at least 30 feet in diameter with its
thrashings. It was on display at a service station
in Barberton for a week before health officials
ordered it buried.
An 8-foot snake with a diamond shape on its
flat head struck at Orland Packer’s horse as he
was riding near Kenton, Ohio, on June 9, 1946.
The D. A. Crance family was driving next to
Spy Run Creek in Fort Wayne, Indiana, on
June 13, 1952, when they saw an 18-foot, gray-
ish-blue snake with a head as big as a bulldog
cross the road. The Fort Wayne Journal-Gazette
nicknamed it “Pete the Python” after a hunt or-
ganized by Sheriff Harold Zeis had gone on for
three days without finding anything. Additional
sightings ended with a hoax story on June 18.
Eileen Blackburn was driving on 1-15 south
of Cascade, Montana, in October 1978 when
she struck a snake 20-30 feet long that was lying
in the road with its head and neck 2-3 feet in
the air. It was gray-white with a tan stripe and
had a flat head.
Clifton Louviere shot a 2 5 -foot snake on his
pig farm near Ames, Liberty County, Texas, on
April 10, 1982. However, the carcass disap-
peared the next day, and Louviere supposed the
snake had only been stunned.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Black rat snake ( Elaphe obsoleta
obsoleta ) typically grows no longer than 7
feet, although an 8-footer has been
recognized. It is a uniform black with faint
spotting and is found in the east from
Kansas to Connecticut.
(2) The Northern black racer ( Coluber
constrictor constrictor) does not grow much
longer than 6 feet. It is black, with dark,
middorsal blotches, and is found from
southern Maine to northern Alabama. The
Southern black racer (C. c. priapus) is similar
and ranges from southern Indiana to Florida.
(3) The Eastern coachwhip (Masticophis
200 GIANT NORTH AMERICAN SNAKE
flagellum flagellum ) is typically 4-5 feet
long, with oversize individuals reported up
to 8 feet 6 inches. The head and neck are
dark brown or black, gradating to a lighter
color ventrally. Found in the South from
North Carolina to Florida and west to
Texas.
(4) The Eastern cottonmouth ( Agkistrodon
piscivorus piscivorus) is a brown, black, or
olive semiaquatic snake normally only 3-4
feet long, with a maximum length of 6 feet.
Its range is from southeastern Virginia to
central Georgia. The Western cottonmouth
(A. p. leucostoma) maxes out at 5 feet and is
found from southern Illinois to Alabama
and eastern Texas.
(5) An escaped Indian python ( Python
molurus ), an Asian snake that has an average
length of 13 feet and an outsize length of 20
feet.

Giant Owl
Mystery Bird of the central and eastern United
States.
Variant names: Bighoot, Booger owl, Flying
head, In-da-dhin-ga (Omaha-Ponca/Siouan),
Mothman, WoooWc xx>.
Physical description: Length, 4 feet. White.
Wingspan, 10-12 feet.
Behavior: Nocturnal. Said to be able to carry
off lambs, calves, dogs, and small children.
Distribution: South Texas; the Ozark Moun-
tains, Arkansas; southern Ohio; northern New
Jersey; West Virginia.
Significant sightings: Iroquoian legends of
“flying heads” may be related to large owls.
A woman saw a large bird at Rocky Fork
Lake, southern Ohio, at sundown in August
1982. It looked just like a 10-foot tree until it
moved into a clearing and unfolded its wings.
One year later, near the same spot on the same
lake, she saw it again, this time noticing its yel-
lowish legs and feet.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Snowy owl ( Nyctea scandiaca) is the
closest in plumage but is only half as large,
with a wingspan of 4 feet 4 inches. It breeds
in the Arctic but winters as far south as
Minnesota, Michigan, and New York.
Strays are occasionally found much farther
south, often in the daytime and usually sick
or hungry.
(2) The largest living owl is the Eurasian
eagle-owl ( Bubo bubo ), which reaches 30
inches in length and is only found in
Europe and Asia. Its feet are the size of a
man’s hand.
(3) A giant flightless owl ( Ornimegalonyx
oteroi ) that exceeded 3 feet in length is
known from the Pleistocene of Cuba, but
there is no evidence of its persistence into
modern times.

Giant Pennsylvania Snake
Large SNAKE of south-central Pennsylvania and
northern Maryland.
Variant names: Big snake, Boss snake, The
Devil, Devil snake, Heap big snake, Log snake.
Physical description: Length, 15-20 feet. Di-
ameter, 8-10 inches, or as thick as a stovepipe.
Black with some gray, dark gray with yellow
markings, or dirty tan with variegated markings.
Huge mouth.
Behavior: Sometimes blocks rural roads. Coils
its tail around a tree branch and swings its head
to and fro. Said to be able to move with its head
and neck erect. Hisses or groans. Eats roosters
and cats.
Habitat: Forests, mountains, rocky areas.
Distribution: Southern Pennsylvania; north-
ern Maryland.
Significant sightings: Emanuel Bushman’s
brother and six others saw a Devil snake on Big
Round Top, south of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania,
in April 1833. Other reports place the snake in
Devil’s Den. It was probably gone by the Battle
of Gettysburg in July 1863, but the name
“Devil’s Den” may have originated with this
creature rather than Confederate sniper fire dur-
ing the battle.
A black snake 25-35 feet long was seen in the
vicinity of Allentown, Pennsylvania, in 1870
and 187L catching and eating roosters and cats.
A 15-foot “anaconda” was reported around
Hall’s Springs, Maryland, in the summer of
1875. Its track was measured at 11.5-15 inches
wide. It swallowed pigs, a turkey, and a chicken
in a trap set for it, but it eluded capture.
Present status: Possibly the same as other G I ANT
North American Snakes reported elsewhere.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Black rat snake ( Elaphe obsoleta
obsoletd) is the largest snake in Pennsylvania,
growing to 7 feet in length. It is solid black
with faint traces of a spotted pattern.
(2) The Northern black racer ( Coluber
constrictor constrictor) is the second-largest
snake in Pennsylvania but does not grow
much longer than 6 feet and is more slender
than the rat snake. It is bluish-gray to black
on top, with some white on the chin.
(3) The Bullsnake ( Pituophis catenifer sayi),
a yellowish colubrid snake with dark
blotches, grows to over 8 feet long but is
only found in isolated pockets in the East.
(4) A large, unknown subspecies of
bullsnake, suggested by Chad Arment.

Giant Python
Individual SNAKE or a separate species of reticu-
lated python of East Asia that exceeds the ac-
cepted length of 33 feet.
Physical description: Length, 33-70 feet.
Distribution: India; Bangladesh; Thailand;
Indonesia; the Philippines.
202 GIANT PENNSYLVANIA SNAKE
Significant sightings: On May 21, 1877, the
crew of the barque Georgina saw a large, gray-
and-yellow snake, 40-50 feet long, swimming
in the Indian Ocean west of Sumatra, Indone-
sia.
Third Officer S. Clayton, of the China Navi-
gation Company’s Taiyuan , observed what
looked to be a 70-foot, cane-colored python
swimming with horizontal undulations in the
Celebes Sea in the summer of 1907.
Present status: The greatest official length for
a Reticulated python ( Python reticulatus) was 32
feet 9.75 inches, recorded in 1912 on the north
coast of Sulawesi, Indonesia. It is the only
species that regularly exceeds 20 feet in length.

Giant Rabbit
Mystery MARSUP IALof Australia.
Habitat: Desert.
Distribution: Central Australia.
Significant sighting: Gold prospectors are said
to have reported rabbits 9 feet long, according
to Bernard Heuvelmans.
Possible explanations:
(1) Naturalist Ambrose Pratt suggested a
surviving Diprotodon optatum , the largest
marsupial that ever lived, which was
probably contemporaneous with earlier
generations of Aborigines and died out
18,000-6,000 years ago. This large-snouted
browser was nearly 1 0 feet long and almost
8 feet high at the shoulder.
(2) Palorchestes azael y a Late Pleistocene
herbivore, was a 1-ton marsupial the size of
a horse that could balance on its powerful
tail and hind limbs like a kangaroo while
reaching up with huge, curved claws on its
forelimbs to pull trees and branches into the
reach of its short, elephant-like trunk.
(3) Christine Janis pointed out that the
Sthenurinae, an extinct subfamily of
kangaroos, may be better candidates than
the lumbering Diprotodon optatum. The
sthenurine kangaroos had shorter tails,
bigger forearms, and possibly longer ears,
making them look more rabbitlike.

Unfortunately, the original source for the
prospectors’ report is unknown.
Giant Rat-Tail
Unknown marine FlSH.
Physical description: Length, 6-10 feet.
Distribution: North Atlantic Ocean.
Significant sightings: Two observations — one
in deep water near Bermuda in the 1930s, an-
other above the seafloor in the Gulf of Mexico
in the 1960s.
Possible explanation: Unknown species of
Grenadier or Rat- tail (Family Macro uridae) of
exceptional size. Macrourids are deepwater
fishes with sharply narrowing tails. There are
285 species, the largest of which is the Giant
grenadier (. Albatrossia pectoralis) , which grows to
5 feet long.
Source: Gardner Soule, Mystery Monsters of
the Deep (New York: Franklin Watts, 1981).
Giant Salmon
Mystery FlSH of northern China.
Physical description: Red fish similar to the
taimen but five times as large. Length, up to 33
feet. Head, 3 feet across. Spiny dorsal rays. Tail
fins.
Behavior: Causes huge waves. Said to feed on
cattle and sheep.
GIANT SALMON 203
Distribution: Lake Hanas, Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, China.
Significant sightings : Biologist Xiang Lihao
and his students visited the lake in July 1985
and photographed a school of some sixty of
these fishes. However, the photos have appar-
ently never been published.
Three 13-foot specimens were reported by
fishermen in July 1988.
Possible explanation: Enormous species of
Taimen ( Hucho taimen ), a large, freshwater
salmon that resembles a pike or muskellunge
and normally only grows to 6 feet long.

Giant Spider
Unknown arthropod INVERTEBRATE of Central
Africa and Australasia.
Physical description: Huge spider.
Distribution: Democratic Republic of the
Congo; Papua New Guinea.
Significant sightings: R. K. Lloyd and his wife
were motoring in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo in 1938 when they saw a large object
crossing the trail in front of them. At first, they
thought it was a cat or a monkey, but they soon
realized it was a spider with legs nearly 3 feet long.
An Australian soldier, on patrol along the
Kokoda Trail in Papua New Guinea in the fall
of 1942, claims to have run across a spider the
size of a puppy dog that had spun a 10- to 15-
foot web.
Present status: The largest known living spider
is the Goliath birdeater ( Theraphosa blondi) of
northern South America, a tarantula with a 13-
inch legspan and a body length of 3.5 inches.
Other big species are the Brazilian salmon taran-
tula ( Lasiodora parahybana) and the Brazilian
tawnyred ( Grammostola mollicomd) , both with
legspans of 10 inches. The largest known fossil
spider was Megarachne servinei, a 16-inch-long
giant with a legspan greater than 20 inches that
lived in San Luis Province, Argentina, 300 mil-
lion years ago, during the Carboniferous period.

Giant Tongan Skink
An unknown LIZARD of Oceania.
Physical description: Total length, about 18
inches long. Diameter, 1—1.5 inches. Dull
green, with blackish markings.
Behavior: Runs away swiftly.
Habitat: Wooded areas.
Distribution: Tongatapu Island, Tonga.
Significant sightings: Lannon Oldenburg saw a
lizard about 18 inches long running across the
ground in a plantation near Tupou College. It
was dull green with black markings and lacked a
middorsal ridge.
Peter Chignell observed a large lizard in an
isolated stand of forest near an ancient burial
mound during a burn-off of some scrubland. It
was about 1.4 inches in diameter.
Present status: John R. H. Gibbons conducted
an extensive search for skinks in the remaining
stand of forest on Tongatapu in 1985. No un-
known species were found. Deforestation and
the introduction of cats and rats have made it
difficult for any large lizards to survive on Ton-
gatapu. Neighboring Eua’ Island holds more
promise.
Possible explanations:
(1) A Giant skink ( Tachygyia micro lep is ) ,
known only from two specimens probably
collected from Tongatapu Island in 1827 by
J. R. C. Quoy and J. P. Guimard, was over
12 inches long. However, its coloration was
dark brown, with no markings. Also, this
species probably crawled rather than ran.
(2) An unnamed, olive-brown skink ( Emoia
trossula ) found in Tonga and Fiji is more
likely, though it rarely exceeds 6 inches in
length.

204 GIANT SPIDER
Giant Vampire Bat
Unknown B AT of South America.
Physical description: Large size.
Behavior: Said to attack cattle and horses.
Distribution: Rio Ribeira valley, Sao Paulo
State, Brazil.
Possible explanation: Surviving population of
the extinct Giant vampire bat ( Desmodus dracu-
lae ), a large bat that lived 500,000 years ago, in
the Pleistocene.

Gigantic Octopus
A huge CEPHMOPOD of the North Atlantic
Ocean.
Scientific names: Octopus giganteus , given by
Addison E. Verrill in 1897; Otoctopus giganteus,
proposed by Michel Raynal in 1986.
Variant names: Bermuda blob, Lusca.
Distribution: From the east coast of Florida to
Bermuda, Belize, and south Texas.
Significant sightings: On November 30, 1896,
a huge carcass was found washed up on Anasta-
sia Beach, near St. Augustine, Florida. DeWitt
Webb, a local medical doctor, examined and
took several photographs of it. The specimen
was 20 feet long, 4 feet high, and 5 feet wide. Its
estimated weight was 5 tons. It had a pear-
shaped, pinkish body with a silvery cast and was
covered with 3-6 inches of extremely tough
connective tissue. The stumps of five arms were
evident, and some of the detached arms, one of
which was 28 feet long and 8 inches thick, were
found lying several feet away. Some of the inter-
nal organs were still present. A storm carried the
mass out to sea in early January 1897, but it
reappeared 2 miles farther south, and Webb
managed to haul it up to higher ground using
horses, tackle, and windlass. He identified the
remains as an octopus and sent descriptions,
photos, and tissue samples to Yale cephalopod
expert Addison E. Verrill. Verrill first identified
the mass as a Giant squid ( Architeuthis ) but
DeWitt Webb shown in front of the remains of what
might have been a Giant OCTOPUS washed ashore near
St. Augustine, Florida, in 1896. (Fortean Picture Li-
brary)
changed his designation to Gigantic octopus
long enough to give it a scientific name; he then
retracted that statement after looking more
closely at Webb’s tissue samples and suggested
the mass may have come from the nose of a
Sperm whale ( Physeter catodori).
A blob of similar matter with five arms
washed into Mangrove Bay on Bermuda in May
1988. Discovered by Teddy Tucker, it was a
mass of tough, white, fibrous substance 8 feet
long and about 3 feet thick.
Tissue analysis: Fortunately, a sample from
the 1896 stranding sent to William H. Dali at
the Smithsonian Institution had been retained,
though the bulk of it is now lost. Three analyses
have been performed on this material: histolog-
ical tests in 1963 by Joseph Gennaro, amino-
acid analysis in 1986 by Roy Mackal, and elec-
tron-microscope and biochemical procedures in
1994 by Sidney Pierce. The first two analyses
indicated the substance was connective tissue
similar to that found in an octopus; the last sug-
gested that both it and the 1988 Bermuda sam-
ple consisted of collagen — whale blubber in the
first instance and the thick skin of a fish in the
second. Probably only a sophisticated collagen
electrophoresis test or amino-acid sequence
analysis will resolve this discrepancy. Unfortu-
GIGANTIC OCTOPUS 205
nately, the Florida specimen may be too con-
taminated now to be tested successfully.
Possible explanations:
(1) A gigantic North Atlantic variety of
octopus. The largest known species is the
Giant Pacific octopus (Enter octopus
dofleini ), which can exceed a radial spread
of 20 feet and a weight of 100 pounds. A
smaller relative, E. megalocyathus , is found
in the eastern South Pacific and South
Atlantic in Chilean and Argentinan waters.
Michel Raynal has suggested that a giant
form of cirrate octopus, such as Cirroteuthis,
might be involved.
(2) The spermaceti tank from a sperm
whale’s head, which has a baglike shape,
weighs several tons and is rich in collagen.
(3) A decomposed Ocean sunfish (Mola
mold) because of its unusual shape. The
heaviest of all bony fishes, with a maximum
weight of 4,400 pounds, the sunfish looks
like a big head with long dorsal and anal fins.
The scaleless body is covered with thick,
elastic skin. It grows to a maximum length of
nearly 1 1 feet and is common in warm and
temperate waters of the Atlantic. However, a
sunfish does not come close to matching the
description of the original specimen.

Gigantic Pacific Octopus
A huge CEPHALOPOD of the Pacific Ocean.
Variant name: G LOBSTER
Physical description: Grayish-brown. Arms,
8-75 feet long.
Distribution: Hawaiian Islands; the Philippines.
Significant sightings: In 1928, when stationed
at Pearl Harbor, Robert Todd Aiken discovered
a group of six large octopuses, 40 feet from tip
to tip, off the shore of Oahu. In July 1936, he
brought film director Robert Hale to the spot to
film a documentary. Whether it was ever filmed
or not is unknown.
206 GIGANTIC PACIFIC OCTOPUS
In 1950, Madison Rigdon saw an octopus the
size of a car surrounded by sharks off Lahilahi
Point, near Makaha, Oahu, Hawaii. It defended
itself with a 30-foot tentacle that had suckers
the size of dinner plates.
Also in 1950, off the Kona Coast, Hawaii,
fisherman Val Ako saw a monster octopus, with
tentacles 75 feet long and suckers as big as auto
tires, resting underwater on a reef. His kupuna
(family adviser) told him later that the octopus
came to the island every year for a month with
a female.
On December 24, 1989, a group of fourteen
people on an 18-foot motorized canoe in Iligan
Bay in the Philippines watched as a huge octo-
pus with 8-foot tentacles seized the boat and
started rocking it. After ten minutes, the boat
capsized. The passengers were either saved by
fishermen or swam to shore.
Possible explanation: A gigantic Pacific variety
of octopus. The largest known octopus is the
Giant Pacific octopus ( Enteroctopus dofleini ),
which can exceed a radial spread of 20 feet and
a weight of 100 pounds. One individual cap-
tured near Victoria, British Columbia, in 1967
weighed 156 pounds and was almost 23 feet
from arm tip to arm tip. There are unofficial
records of a few individuals greater than 300
pounds and one that was more than 400
pounds. This creature ranges from the coast of
southern California north to Alaska and into
Asia south to Japan. A smaller relative, E. mega -
locyathus, is found in the eastern South Pacific
and South Atlantic in Chilean and Argentinan
waters.

Gilyuk
True Giant hominid or Cannibal Giant of
Alaska.
Etymology : Probably Na-Dene word, “big
man with the little hat.”
Variant name: Nandna (Tanaina/Na-Dene).
Physical description: Covered with shaggy
hair.
Behavior: Whistles. Wears a little hat. Twists
birch saplings. Said to abduct and eat humans.
Distribution: Southern Alaska.

Gjevstroll
F RESHmiER Monster of Norway.
Distribution: Fyresvatn, Telemark County,
Norway.
Significant sighting: Two men saw a large an-
imal in the lake in 1918, and one of them fired
three rounds at it with his Krag Jorgensen rifle.

Glaucous Macaw
Colorful Bird of the Parrot family (Psittacidae)
in South America, presumed extinct since the
1930s.
Scientific name: Anodorhynchus glaucus , given
by Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1818.
Physical description: Dull-gray turquoise par-
rot with brownish-gray throat and sooty face.
Total length including tail is about 29 inches.
Black bill.
Habitat: Swampy riverlands.
Distribution: Recent reports have been from
Corrientes and Misiones Provinces, Argentina;
Artigas department, Uruguay; Rio Grande do
Sul and Santa Caterina States, Brazil.
Significant sightings: Unconfirmed reports of
this species were made in 1951, 1970, and
1988. In 1992, one of a pair of Lear’s macaws
was identified as a female Glaucous macaw by
several, but not all, macaw experts.
Present status: Most likely extinct since the
1930s, if not earlier. The last known specimen
died at the London Zoo in 1912. Another was
GLAUCOUS MACAW 207
housed in the Buenos Aires Zoo as late as 1936,
but it may have been a Lear’s macaw. Destruc-
tion of its primary food source, the Yatay palm
(. Butia yatay), has been the major factor in its
disappearance.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Hyacinth macaw ( Anodorhynchus
hyacinthinus) is larger and bluer.
(2) The Lear’s macaw (A. leari) is also
slightly larger and brighter.

Glawackus
Eastern Puma of Connecticut.
Etymology: From town name — Glastonbury,
Connecticut — plus “wacky.”
Variant names: Granby panther, Injun devil.
Physical description: Looks variously like a
large cat or dog. Length, 4 feet. Height, 2 feet-2
feet 6 inches. Black or tawny in color. Long tail,
sometimes described as bushy.
Behavior: Emits blood-curdling screams.
Tracks: Like a puma’s.
Distribution: North-central Connecticut.
Significant sightings: After weeks of hearing
odd animal cries, finding large cat tracks, and
seeing glimpses of a large black cat or dog, resi-
dents of Glastonbury, Connecticut, organized
an all-day hunt into the surrounding hills on
January 14, 1939. Nothing was found, but
sightings continued until February 24, when
Harold Roberts found a 2-mile trail of paw-
prints 4 miles east of town.
Another cluster of sightings took place in the
mid-1950s, with a climax in the summer of
1959 around Granby, Connecticut, where farm
animals were attacked by something pumalike.
Black cats continued to be reported through
1967. Since then, reports of tawny animals have
been more frequent.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Eastern Puma returning to its
former range. The last killing of a Puma
( Puma concolor couguar) in New England
was in 1881 at Barnard, Vermont.
(2) Accidental or deliberate reintroduction
of pet or show pumas.
(3) Escaped melanistic Jaguars ( Panthera
oncd) or Leopards ( Panthera pardus).
(4) Loren Coleman suggests that the black
cats are surviving maneless, female
American lions ( Panthera atrox ), a
Pleistocene lion that died out 9,000 years
ago, while the males are reported as MANED
American Lions.

Globster
Beached specimens of GIGANTIC PACIFIC OCIO-
PUS or other organic masses of the Pacific Ocean.
Etymology: Coined by Ivan T. Sanderson to
describe the 1960 carcass.
Variant names: Jughead, The Thing.
Physical description: No apparent bone struc-
ture. Ivory-colored, rubbery, stringy, extremely
tough skin. Covered with fine hair or fiber, like
greasy sheep’s wool. No defined head. No visi-
ble eyes. Five gill-like, hairless slits on each side.
Smooth, gullet-like orifice.
Distribution: Pacific Ocean.
Significant sightings: A headless carcass about
20-22 feet long and 4 feet wide was found on
the Pacific coast near Delake, Oregon, in March
1950. Local people nicknamed it “Jughead” and
cut off pieces of it as souvenirs.
A huge mass of organic material was found on
the beach north of the Interview River, Tasma-
nia, Australia, in August 1960 by Ben Fenton,
Jack Boote, and Ray Anthony. It measured 20
feet long by 18 feet wide by 4 feet 6 inches
208 GLAWACKUS
thick, and it weighed 5-10 tons. It appeared to
be made up of “tendon-like threads welded to-
gether with a fatty substance.” Over eighteen
months, it showed no signs of decomposition.
An on-site analysis of the material by Bruce
Mollison of the Commonwealth Scientific and
Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) on
March 7, 1962, was unable to provide an iden-
tification. A second CSIRO analysis on March
17, 1962, indicated protein and collagen as pri-
mary components and suggested the material
was “not inconsistent with blubber.”
Another fibrous Globster was found in
March 1965 on Muriwai Beach, North Island,
New Zealand. It was 30 feet long, 8 feet high,
and covered with hair 4-6 inches long.
Ben Fenton found a third Australasian Glob-
ster south of Sandy Cape, Tasmania, in No-
vember 1970. This one was 8 feet long.
An 8- to 1 0-foot specimen that washed ashore
near Wanganui, New Zealand, in early October
1997 was dismissed as a partly decomposed
sperm whale.
A 4-ton, 20-foot fibrous mass with six tenta-
cles washed up on Four Mile Beach, northwest
of Zeehan, Tasmania, in late December 1997
and was similarly diagnosed as whale blubber.
Possible explanations:
(1) A Pacific manta ray ( Manta hamiltoni ),
which can weigh up to 1.5 tons, was
suggested by A. M. Clark.
(2) Whale blubber, especially the 1965 New
Zealand carcass, though no one noticed any
characteristic oil, odor, bones, or internal
organs.
(3) Remains of a GIGANTIC PACIFIC
Octopus.
(4) The Basking shark ( Cetorhinus maximus)
attains a length of 40 feet. Decomposition
causes its muscle fibers to appear stringy.

210 GOATMAN
Golden Ant
Legendary INVERTEBRATE or RODENT of Cen-
tral Asia.
Physical description: Size of a fox. Skin like a
leopard’s.
Behavior: Moves swiftly. Digs holes in the
winter.
Distribution: Highlands around the Indus
River area in Pakistan; Jammu and Kashmir
State, India.
Significant sighting: The ancient Greek histo-
rian Herodotus wrote of an area in northern
India where large, vicious ants dug burrows that
turned up a large quantity of gold-bearing sand.
The Persians went to the region in the morning
to bag the sand and take it back while the ants
were still underground.
Present status: Not taken very seriously for
nearly 2,500 years, until Michel Peissel visited
the region in 1996.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Long- tailed marmot ( Marmota
caudata) of Baltistan in northern Pakistan,
Michel Peissel notes, burrows in gold-
bearing soil. The ancient Persian word for
these animals translates as “mountain ant,”
which resulted in Herodotus’s
misidentification.
(2) Other sources mention giant insects in
northern China. Berthold Laufer has
suggested a confusion of the Mongolian
word for ant, shorgoolj y with the Shirongol
Mongols, now more commonly known as
the Dongxiang, who currently live in Gansu
Province, China, east of Linxia.

Golden Ram
Sheep of West Asia; see Sem IM YTHI CAL BEASTS.
Physical description: Like a normal ram but
with wings and golden wool.
Behavior: Flies easily through the air. Has the
ability to reason and speak.
Distribution: The Black Sea coast of Georgia.
Significant sighting: Chrysomallus was a
winged ram with golden wool that was sent to
earth by Hermes. The animal was the object of
Jason’s voyage in the ship Argo to the shore of
Colchis on the Black Sea in 1400 B.G or earlier.
Possible explanations:
(1) Jason’s expedition might really have
been in search of gold said to be found in
the rivers of Colchis (modern Georgia). In
the first century B.G, Strabo described an
ancient method of extracting gold from
alluvial sands by sifting water over ramskins
that retained the grains of gold in their
fleece. The Egyptians used this method, as
documented on a wall painting in the
Temple of Ramses III at Medinet-Habu.
The myth of a Golden ram derived from
this process.
(2) The fleece of the Golden ram could
have possessed extremely fine fibers like
those from the wool of the Spanish or
American merino breeds, making it
considerably valuable for weaving. Scythian
fine-wooled sheep apparently existed around
the Black Sea as early as the fifth century
B.G
(3) In 1932, Claude Rimington, of the
Wool Industries Research Association in
Leeds, investigated a golden-brown pigment
found in varying intensities within the suint
secreted by the sweat glands of certain
sheep. Later research showed it was caused
by bilirubin from the sheep’s liver that had
passed into the sweat, producing an
abnormal golden coloration. The condition
was stimulated when the sheep ate the leaves
of certain plants, including Shrub verbena
( Lantana spp.) and the Olive tree ( Olea
GOLDEN RAM 211
europaea ), that prevent the liver from
excreting bilirubin effectively.

Golub-Yavan
WlLDM AN of Central Asia.
Etymology: Tajik (Persian), “wild man.”
Variant names: Galub-yavan, Ghool-biaban,
Gul-biavan, Gul’bi-yavan, Guli-b’yabon,
Gulibyavan, Khaivan-akvan, Voita. See also Gul
Physical description: Height, 5 feet— 6 feet 6
inches. Covered in reddish-gray or black hair.
Older individuals are grayer. Head-hair is thick
and matted. Slanting forehead. Brows and
cheekbones are prominent. Face is bare. Glow-
ing eyes. Wide, flat nose. Ears stick out. Lower
jaw is massive. Large teeth. Short neck. Thick
hair on chest and hips, close-cropped and thick
on the belly. Long arms. Buttocks are relatively
hairless. Knees are calloused. Feet and palms are
hairless. Feet are wider and shorter than a man’s.
Behavior: Call is a mewing or whistling
sound. Strong odor. Food includes berries.
Searches for marmots under rocks, making piles
of rocks in the process. Uses caves as shelters.
Uses sticks as weapons. Said to attack humans.
Tracks: Humanlike but shorter and broader.
The four smaller toes are wider than a human’s.
Distribution: Pamir and Tian Shan Moun-
tains, Kyrgyzstan; eastern Tajikistan. Possibly
extends into the Kunlun Mountains of western
China south of Taxkorgan, the Karakoram
Range in northern India, and the Hindu Kush
of eastern Afghanistan.
Significant sightings: Maj. Gen. Mikhail Top-
ilski, head of a scouting party in the fall of 1925,
ran across a group of Golub-yavan during a skir-
mish with White Russian guerrillas in the
Vanch District, Tajikistan; the guerrillas had
taken refuge in an ice cave that the creatures ap-
parently used as a shelter. One wildman was
shot and inspected by the party’s physician. The
dead creature was 5 feet 6 inches tall and looked
much more human than apelike, though it was
covered with dense hair except for its face,
palms, soles, knees, and buttocks. It had heavy
browridges, a flat nose, and a massive lower jaw.
The foot was noticeably wider than a human’s.
The soldiers could not take the body with them,
so they buried it under a heap of stones.
A resident of Imeni Kalinina, Tajikistan, was
attacked by a Gul-biavan while hunting in
1939. He wrestled it to the ground but lost con-
sciousness. Villagers found him later, along with
evidence of a struggle.
Hunters in the mountains around Vanch,
Tajikistan, call the wildman a Voita and say it is
taller than a man and covered with short, black
hair.
Alexander G. Pronin saw a Golub-yavan on a
cliff in the Balyandkiik Valley, Tajikistan, on
August 12, 1957. It walked out of a cave and
was visible for several minutes before it disap-
peared from view.
Possible explanation: A surviving early ho-
minid. Artifacts and Homo erectus- like remains,
dated at 125,000 years ago, have been found at
Selungur Cave, Kyrgyzstan. Early Paleolithic
stone flakes and cores about 850,000 years old
were discovered at Kuldara, Tajikistan. A Nean-
derthal burial and grave goods have been found
in the Teshik-Tash Cave in Uzbekistan.

Goodenough Island Bird
Mystery Bird of Australasia.
Physical description: Black plumage. Size of a
small crow. Long tail.
Behavior: Call is a short, explosive rattle.
Distribution: Goodenough Island, Papua
New Guinea.
Significant sightings: One member of the
1953 Fourth Archbold Expedition saw a crow-
sized, black bird high in the treetops on Good-
enough.
Zoologist James Menzies saw a group of these
birds in the forest canopy of Mount Oiamadawa
on December 28, 1975.
Possible explanations:
(1) An unknown species of Bird of paradise
(Astrapia sp.), Honeyeater (Meliphaga sp.),
or Drongo (Family Dicruridae).
(2) The Paradise crow ( Lycocorax
pyrrhopterus ), suggested by Karl Shuker,
although this is thought to be endemic to
Halmahera, Bacan, Obi, and adjacent
islands in Indonesia.

Gorillai
Either a WlIDM AN of West Africa or an ancient
encounter with an anthropoid ape.
Etymology: Unknown; probably derived from
an African word that Hanno the Carthaginian
heard. One hypothesis is that it represents the
Kongo (Bantu) word ngo diida (“powerful ani-
mal that beats its chest”), which assumes Hanno
made it south of the equator; other hypotheses
include the Wolof (Atlantic) word goloh (“ape”)
in Senegal and the Benga (Bantu) word ngiya,
used for the gorilla in Gabon.
Physical description: Hairy and wild.
Behavior: The males run away into the moun-
tains and let the females be slaughtered.
Significant sighting: Hanno the Carthaginian
discovered Gorillai’ on his voyage along the
African coast in the early fifth century B .G and
is said to have taken two skins back to Carthage,
where they were displayed in the Temple of
Juno.
Distribution: An island on the West African
coast. Bernard Heuvelmans thought the loca-
tion was Morocco; others think it was Senegal,
Sierra Leone, Cameroon, or Gabon.
Possible explanations:
(1) Neanderthals ( Homo neanderthalensis)
surviving into historical times in North
Africa, suggested by Heuvelmans. However,
so far there is no unambiguous evidence
that Neanderthals migrated into Africa from
either Europe or West Asia. Also, there is
no nautical reason to suppose that Hanno
did not actually travel past Cap Vert to the
Gulf of Guinea.
(2) An early account of the Lowland gorilla
(Gorilla gorilla), if Hanno made it as far as
Cameroon. The name of the animal itself
derives from Hanno’s account. Gorillas
can’t swim, however, so if Hanno actually
found them on an island, this explanation is
problematic.

Gougou
Cannibal Giant of eastern Canada.
Etymology: Micmac (Algonquian) word.
Variant names: Gugu, Gugwe, Kuhkw.
Physical description: Female monster taller
than a ship.
Behavior: Carries a pouch in which it puts hu-
mans to be eaten later. Whistles shrilly.
Distribution: Bonaventure Island, Quebec;
Miscou Island, New Brunswick.

Gowrow
Giant Lizard of Arkansas.
Etymology: From the sound the lizards make.
Physical description: Length, up to 20 feet.
Tusklike teeth.
Behavior: Makes an assortment of groans and
hisses.
Habitat: Caves.
Distribution: Boone and Searcy Counties,
northern Arkansas.
Significant sighting: Sometime before 1935,
E. J. Rhodes heard a commotion in a deep cav-
ern called Devil’s Hole, 3 miles northwest of
Myrtle, Arkansas. He crawled down 200 feet to
investigate, but couldn’t see anything. Later,
when he lowered a flatiron on a rope into the
cavern, something bit through the rope.
Present status: Only insubstantial rumors and
folktales exist.
Possible explanations:
(1) Classic example of Ozark folk humor.
(2) A legend based on the Alligator
(■ Crocodylus acutus) , which lives in the
southern two-thirds of Arkansas and grows
to 12 feet long.

Great Auk
Flightless sea Bird of the Auk family (Alcidae)
of the North Atlantic Ocean, extinct since
1844.
Scientific name: Alca impennis , given by Carl
von Linne in 1758.
Variant name: Garefowl.
Physical description: Length, 2 feet 6 inches.
Upper parts black, white below. Oval, white
patch in front of the eye. Large, black beak with
white grooves.
Behavior: Flightless.
Distribution: Canada; Greenland; Iceland;
Scotland; Norway.
Significant sightings: In 1 867, a native Green-
lander is said to have captured a Great auk on an
island in Qeqertarsuaq Tunua, Greenland, and
eaten it.
In the 1920s and 1930s, supposed Great auks
reported in the Lofoten Islands, Nordland
County, Norway, turned out to be penguins
brought from Australia and released by whalers.
Present status: The last known breeding pair
of Great auks were killed by three fishermen on
the island of Eldey, Iceland, on June 3, 1844.
The body parts of these two are kept in speci-
men jars at the University Zoological Museum
in Copenhagen, Denmark. Errol Fuller thinks
the skins are at the Los Angeles County Natural
History Museum and the Royal Institute of
Natural Sciences in Brussels. Other scattered
specimens may have lingered after 1 844 but not
for long.

Greek Dolphin
Unknown CETACEAN of the Mediterranean Sea.
Physical description: Similar to the striped dol-
phin but without the diagnostic dark stripe run-
ning from the underside of the tail to the eye or
the pale-gray, finger-shaped marking below the
dorsal fin.
Significant sighting: Seen several times in the
Mediterranean by Willem Morzer Bruyns.
Possible explanation: Significant variations in
the markings of the Striped dolphin ( Stenella
coeruleoalba ) are known to occur both individu-
ally and geographically.

Grendel
Legendary GlANT HOMINID of Northern Eu-
rope, as portrayed in the oldest narrative epic
poem in English or Teutonic literature, Beowulf.
The text in its known form dates from a copy
made around A.D. 1000, but it represents a tra-
dition that dates from a much earlier time.
Etymology: Old English, “grinder” or “de-
stroyer.”
Variant names: Eoten, Feond, Thyrs.
Physical description: Large. Gorilla-like. Cov-
ered with hair.
Behavior: Nocturnal. Eats humans. Able to
change shape.
Habitat: Marshes.
Significant sighting: The sixth-century Scandi-
navian hero Beowulf traveled from Geatland in
southern Sweden to aid the Danish king Hroth-
gar, whose great hall, Heorot (possibly located
on the site of modern Lejre near Copenhagen in
Denmark), was under attack by the giant Gren-
del. Beowulf killed both Grendel and its mother
in two separate battles.
Possible explanations:
(1) Folk memory of Neanderthals ( Homo
neanderthalensih or other early hominids
who coexisted with Europeans in ancient or
medieval times.
(2) Folk tradition of Scandinavian corpse-
eating ghosts (Draugr).

GRENDEL 215
Griffin
Sem im YTHICAL Beast of Central Asia.
Etymology: From the Latin gryphus , a mis-
spelling of grypus, derived from the Greek gryps
(“hooked”) and possibly related to the Persian
giriften (to “grip” or “seize”).
Variant names: BRENTFORD Griffin, Griffon,
Gryphon, Gryps.
Physical description: Size of a wolf. Has scales
or feathers. Crest (in Asia) or mane (in Greece).
Fiery red eyes. Knob or short horn on head
might represent long, upright ears. Strong beak
like an eagle’s. Neck is variegated, with blue
feathers. Black feathers on back, red feathers on
breast. Wing feathers are white. Four legs. Large
claws. Further symbolic embellishments were
added to this profile in the Middle Ages.
Behavior: Flightless despite its wings. Lays
eggs in burrows in auriferous deposits. Said to
guard gold and be protective of its young. At-
tacks horses, mountain lions, elk, geese, deer,
and humans. Can be captured with a baited trap.
Distribution: The Altai and Tien Shan Moun-
tains and the Gobi Desert of China, Mongolia,
and adjacent regions.
Significant sightings: The Griffin appears on
Scythian gold, bronze, wood, and leather arti-
facts from 3000 to 100 B.G It became a popular
theme in Greek art around 600 B.G and in
Roman art until A.D. 300.
The Griffin was first described in literature by
Aristeas in his lost epic the Arimaspea , written
about 675 B.G, as an animal known to Scythian
nomads who traded with the Greeks and trav-
eled as far west as the Altai Mountains of Mon-
golia and China. Intriguingly, the Scythian
word arimaspu, which refers to the CYCLOPS
(Arimaspeans) who try to steal gold from the
Griffins, is linguistically related to the Mongo-
lian Aim AS. Aristeas’s story was repeated by the
Greek playwright Aeschylus in his tragedy
Prometheus Bound (lines 790-805) and by other
classical authors.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Tibetan mastiff, a large guard dog
bred for centuries in the Himalayas to
protect monasteries, villages, nomadic
camps, and livestock herds, was suggested
by Valentine Ball.
The Griffin has appeared in artistic representations since
3000 B.c. (© 2002 ArtToday.com, Inc., an IMSI Com-
pany)
(2) A local Jerboa (Family Allactaginae) or
Squirrel (Family Sciuridae) because of its
burrowing activities.
(3) The Lammergeier ( Gypaetus barbatus ), a
large, carrion-eating bird of Central Asia,
has been suggested by Peter Costello; also
an eagle or another bird of prey. However,
as early as Aeschylus, the flightless gryps was
distinguished from the winged eagle aetos.
(4) A literary invention symbolizing
vigilance, the difficulty of mining gold on
the Asian steppes, swiftness, the sun, the
sky, death, or loyalty.
(5) A speculative re-creation based on the
fossil remains of the Woolly mammoth
( Mammuthus primigenius) , discovered in
antiquity near auriferous sands in Siberia,
proposed by Adolph Erman.
(6) As suggested by Adrienne Mayor, the
Griffin may be based on the fossil remains
of ceratopsian dinosaurs, especially
216 GRIFFIN
Protoceratops, a Late Cretaceous herbivore
that averaged 7-8 feet in length and whose
bones are commonly found in the Gobi,
Turpan, and Junggar Deserts along the
caravan route between the Tien Shan
Mountains of Kyrgyzstan and China and the
Altai Mountains of Mongolia. These
mountains and their alluvial basins were the
source of the gold mined by the Scythians
and other ancient peoples, and the proximity
of the desert fossils accounts for the ancient
association of gold and Gryps. Protoceratops
had a powerful beak and a dorsal shield like
a rearward-projecting horn. Its bones are
common even in modern times, and the area
is a rich source of fossil eggs and clutches of
young dinosaurs.

Groot Slang
Freshwater MoNSTERof South Africa.
Etymology: Afrikaans, “great serpent.”
Variant names: Kayman, Ki-man (Nama/
Khoisan), !Koo-be-eng (Nama/Khoisan),
IKouteign !koo-rou (“master of the water,”
Nama/Khoisan) .
Physical description: Length, 20-39 feet.
Larger than a hippo. Black skin. Head, 7-8
inches wide. Neck, 8-10 feet long.
Tracks: Width, 18 inches.
Habitat: Rivers, lakes, and swamps.
Distribution: Orange and Vaal Rivers, South
Africa.
Significant sightings: A Nama rock painting
on Cathedral Peak, KwaZulu-Natal Province,
South Africa, depicts a great horned serpent
called !Koo-be-eng. Others appear in Brak-
fontein Cave near Koesberg; in the cave near
Klein Aasvogelkop; and in the cave of the Great
Black Serpent in Rockwood Glen, near the
Upper Orange River.
About 1867, Hans Sauer saw a large, black
snake in the Orange River near Aliwal North,
Eastern Cape Province.
In 1899, merchant G. A. Kinnear was cross-
ing the Orange River near Upington, Northern
Cape Province, when he saw the head of a mon-
strous serpent emerge from the water. About
8-10 feet of head and neck were visible.
In 1910, Frederick C. Cornell was camping
about 20 miles from Augrabiesvalle, Northern
Cape Province, with two companions, one an
American named Kammerer, who was bathing
GROOT SLANG 217
in a pool nearby. Suddenly, Kammerer came
back shouting and said that a great wave had
come up behind him and that a head with mas-
sive jaws belonging to a giant snake had risen 12
feet in the air.
In May 1920, at the confluence of the Great
Fish and Orange Rivers, Frederick C. Cornell
and others in his party saw the head and neck of
a large snake swimming in the water.
John Clift saw a 20-foot crocodilian emerge
from the Big Hole, an abandoned mine crater
near Kimberley, Northern Cape Province, in
November 1947.
In November 1963, newspapers started re-
porting various encounters with a water monster
in the Vaal Dam, Free State Province. Most of
the reports were vague. Stanley Jacob and his fa-
ther, David, watched a monster surface 110
yards from their boat, near Oranjeville on Feb-
ruary 16, 1964. At first, it looked like a swim-
ming horse. They went to fetch a gun, then re-
turned. The animal had grayish-brown skin,
smoother than a hippo’s.
Possible explanations:
(1) A large variety of African rock python
(. Python sebae ), which often grows to 30-33
feet.
(2) The Water monitor ( Varanus niloticus)
is Africa’s largest lizard, reaching more than
5 feet.
(3) An unknown species of monitor lizard,
suggested by naturalist Mike Meyring.
(4) Bernard Heuvelmans equated this
animal with his LONGNECK variety of seal,
which he thought might be responsible for
NESSIE and other lake monsters.

Grotte Cosquer Animal
Paleolithic cave art depicting a Sea MONSTER in
Prance.
Physical description: Fat, bulky body. Small
head on a relatively long neck. Two flexible
front flippers and two pointed rear flippers.
Distribution: Grotte Cosquer, Cap Morgiou,
near Marseille, France.
Present status: This underwater cave was dis-
covered in 1985 by Henri Cosquer, who also
found the artwork six years later. The entrance,
120 feet below water level, would have been
above water during the Ice Age. The charcoal
drawings of animals in the cave were confidently
dated by Jean Courtin and Jacques Collina-
Girard in 1994 as 18,000-19,000 years old.
Most of the images are of land animals, espe-
cially horses, but fully 1 1 percent depict marine
life, including auks, fishes, seals, and jellyfish.
Possible explanations:
(1) Commonly accepted by archaeologists as
depicting a Penguin (Family Spheniscidae),
though it looks nothing like this Antarctic
bird. However, during the Pleistocene, the
colder European climate would have been
favorable to penguins.
(2) A Pur seal or Sea lion (Family
Otariidae), though probably an unknown
species.
(3) The image is remarkably close to
Bernard Heuvelmans’s LONGNECK variety of
Sea monster.

Unknown FlSH of the Indian Ocean.
Physical description: Larger than a great white
shark, which has an average length of 14 feet.
No prominent dorsal fin.
Behavior: Lies in wait for other fishes on the
ocean floor. Said to be a man-eater.
Distribution: Timor Sea.
Possible explanation: A giant form of Wobbe-
gong shark (Family Orectolobidae), suggested by
Karl Shuker. The Spotted wobbegong ( Orec -
tolobus maculatus) inhabits Australasian waters
and grows to 10 feet 6 inches. It feeds on the bot-
tom but attacks waders and fishers in tidal pools.

Guai Wu
Freshwater MoNSTERof China.
Etymology: Mandarin Chinese (Sino-
Tibetan), “strange beast.”
Physical description: Size of an ox. Black with
white underparts. Large, seal-like head. Long
neck.
Distribution: Chon-Ji Lake (also called Tian-
chi, Changbai, or Dragon Lake), Jilin Province,
China.
Significant sightings: Reports date back to the
nineteenth century, but Chinese researchers
claim to have collected 100 reports between
1962 and 1994.
In August 1980, a party of meteorologists saw
a large animal with a 3-foot neck, a cow-shaped
head, and a duck-shaped beak.
In early January 1987, a group of fifty tourists
was surprised when a lake monster surfaced near
the eastern shore. One witness, Shen Ruder,
said it roared like a locomotive and sprayed
water out of its nose.
Photos and a video of a dragonlike animal
were taken on September 2, 1994. The creature
swam for ten minutes on the surface, raising
waves 6 feet high.
Four black animals were seen frolicking in the
lake by more than 200 people in 1996 and were
allegedly captured on film by photographer
Wang Ling.
Present status: The volcano where this lake is
located erupted in 1702, so presumably, any-
thing in it has been imported since that date.

220 GUGWE
Significant sightings: Western Tajikistan has
been the traditional origin of a curative drug
said to be made from the skin of wildmen.
Called mu-go or mu-miyo (possibly from the
Farsi mum, “wax,” though mu also means
“hair”), the preparation was carried by pilgrims
to Mecca and was at one time said to be one of
the sources of wealth for the emir of Bukhara.
The village of Khakimi in the Karatag Valley
was once a production center.
Igor Tatsl and Igor Bourtsev found Gul
tracks near Khakimi, Tajikistan, on August 15
and 21, 1979.
Ukrainian library-school student Nina
Grinyova came close to a Gul nicknamed
“Gosha” in the Varzob River gorge, Tajikistan,
on August 20, 1980, during an expedition to
search for the creatures. Grinyova offered to stay
alone in the woods one night in order to en-
courage a close encounter with a Gul that had
been leaving tracks in the area. The Gul ap-
proached, but Grinyova inadvertently scared it
away by offering it a squeaky rubber toy. She ex-
perienced a fugue walking back to camp and be-
lieves that the creature had a psychic effect on
her.
Vadim Makarov discovered a four-toed,
19.25-inch print on the banks of the Varzob
River on September 29, 1981.

moshin’ (for the female).
Behavior: In the summer, catches fishes, crus-
taceans, and frogs in the rivers. Approaches vil-
lages in the autumn to raid vegetable gardens.
Distribution: Talysh Mountains, Azerbaijan.
Significant sightings: One evening in the
1890s, noted zoologist K. A. Satunin watched a
female Biaban-guli cross a clearing in the Talysh
Mountains, Azerbaijan.
In the summer of 1 947, a soldier in the Azer-
baijani militia named Ramazan was walking
home at night when a shaggy wiidman attacked
him and dragged him to the foot of a nearby
tree, where a female was waiting. The two crea-
tures examined his face and clothes, then
seemed to get into a gutteral argument and
shoving match. Near dawn, they left him alone.

Distribution: Powys, South Wales.
Significant sightings: Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
heard of the Black dog of Hergest while staying
near Clyro, Powys, and was inspired to write his
Sherlock Holmes story “The Hound of the
Baskervilles.” He agreed with the Welsh
Baskerville family to set the scene in Dartmoor
rather than Wales.
Dozens of sheep near Clyro were found with
their throats ripped out in August 1989. At least
two people saw the predator, which they
thought was a large, dark-colored dog.

Hairy Biped
A humanlike or apelike ENTITY ofNorth Amer-

Giant Hominids or North American Apes.
Etymology: Coined by Jerome Clark as a
catchall term for humanoids reported in the
midwest ern and eastern United States and
Canada.
Variant names: Big hairy monster (BHM),
Billiwack monster (in southern California),
BOOGER, Buena foot (in southern California),

(Dakot a/Siouan, “what’s that?”), Wejuk (in
Vermont), Wood devil, Wookie, Woolly

Physical description: Not as uniform as the
BIGFOOT of the Pacific Northwest, though al-
ways covered with hair and walking on two legs
(hence it s name). It ’s difficult t o gener alize t r ait s
from reports that might have multiple causes,
but some of the following features are usually
present . Height , 4—9 feet , t hough sizes up t o 12
feet are mentioned. Hair or fur is r eddish-br own
to black, often described as 6-8 inches long.
Often distinctly lacking in facial features, but a
catlike face is occasionally reported. Red, or-

ange, yellow, or green glowing eyes. Flat, broad
nose. Pointed ears. Werewolflike fangs. Mane.
Long arms. Hands are sometimes clawed. Long
legs-
Behavior: Primarily noct ur nal. Usually has an
awkward, bipedal gait but so met imes runs on all
fours. Said t o be able t o swim. Occasionally seen
with young. Reported calls are moans, grunts,
howls, high-pit ched shrieks. St r ong, put rid odor
like decaying flesh or rotten eggs. These crea-
tures are sometimes ascribed such paranormal
features as invulnerability, transparency, insub-
stantiality, invisibilit y, and the ability to disap-
pear inst ant aneously. Appears to show interest
in and have no fear of human dwellings. Dis-
likes cars and dogs, which often react with great
fright. Sometimes associated with unidentified
flying object (UFO) sightings.
Tracks: Anywhere from two- to six-toed.
Three-toed are perhaps commonest and have
been reported from the South, the Midwest,
Pennsylvania, Maryland, and southern Califor-
nia. Length, up to 14 inches. Stride, up to 5
feet . Hair samples have been found.
All primates have five toes. Any Hairy biped
that leaves clear imprints showing anything less
t han five t oes const it ut es an ext r erne evolut ion-
ary anomaly. Pentadactyly (having five fingers
or toes) is a common and primitive feature of
reptiles and mammals. However, it is not an es-
sential requirement, and many animals have
modified the plan: frogs only have four digits,
cows have two, horses have dropped all but one,
and snakes have gotten rid of legs altogether.
Most birds get by walking on only four (three in
front and one behind), while the Ostrich
(. Struthio camelus) only has two. If three-toed,
humanlike bipeds really exist as flesh-and-blood
creatures and are not paranormal apparitions, it
would be most interesting to find out more
224 HAIRY BIPED
about their foot structure. Perhaps three toes is
better than five when you’ve chosen a swamp or
wetland as your habitat.
Habitat: Secluded areas, often forested wet-
lands or mountainous regions.
Distribution: Nearly every U.S. state and
Canadian province. Most sightings represent
only transient individuals.

HAIRY BIPED 225
Significant sightings: Riley W. Smith saw a
naked hairy man, about 6 feet tall, while picking
berries near Winsted, Connecticut, on August
17, 1895. The incident was the first of about
twenty that allegedly took place in western Con-
necticut and the Catskill Mountains of New
York over the next few weeks. Widely and pos-
sibly erroneously regarded as a hoax by newspa-
perman Louis T. Stone, the original incident
may have involved a bear.
An apelike, bipedal creature with a yellow
head and mane was seen by workers near the Vi-
olet Mine east of Cobalt, Ontario, in September
1906. In 1923, two prospectors saw a similar yel-
low-headed, black-haired animal eating blueber-
ries; they thought it was a bear until they threw
a rock at it, prompting it to get up and walk
away on two legs. Later sightings earned it the
nickname “Old yellow top.” The last sighting
was in August 1970 when Aimee Latreille, the
driver of a bus carrying twenty-seven miners, was
forced to swerve after he saw an apelike creature
with a light mane cross the road; the bus nearly
had a fatal crash down a nearby rock cut.
In August 1963, Harlan E. Ford and a friend
encountered a huge humanoid in Honey Island
Swamp near Slidell, Louisiana. It glared menac-
ingly at them and ran away on two legs.
In May 1964, near Sister Lakes, Michigan,
Gordon Brown and his brother saw a hairy man
about 9 feet tall who made a whimpering sound.
Shortly afterward, three teenagers saw a 7-foot
creature with a black face running through the
underbrush in Silver Creek Township. Many
other witnesses came forth and were named in
extensive newspaper coverage.
A green, 10-foot- tall monster with glowing
red eyes was seen in March 1965 by teenagers in
the woods south of French Lick, Indiana. They
called it “Fluorescent Freddie.”
In 1965, two teenagers were chased from
their campfire by a 9- to 10-foot hairy creature
on the north slope of the San Gorgonio Moun-
tains, California.
On August 13, 1965, Christine Van Acker
and her mother were driving near Monroe,
Michigan, when a hairy, 7-foot giant stepped in
front of their car. Van Acker hit the brakes,
stalling the car, and the creature reached
through the open window and grabbed the top
of her head. The women’s screams and horn
honking apparently made it retreat.
On May 19, 1969, George Kaiser saw a man-
sized creature covered in black fur on his farm
near Rising Sun, Indiana. It made a strange
grunting sound, jumped over a ditch, and
swiftly ran down the road. Later, footprints with
three small toes and a big toe were found. A
greenish-white UFO was seen by a neighbor the
next night.
Odd, froglike noises woke up teenagers
Wayne Hall and Dave Chapman early on July
24, 1972, at the latter’s home near Crystal Lake
Reservoir in northwestern Connecticut. Look-
ing outside, they saw an 8-foot hairy creature. It
crossed a road and moved around in the shad-
ows near a horse barn. After forty-five minutes,
it crossed the road again and disappeared in the
woods by the lake.
On the night of April 22, 1973, William
Roemermann, Brian Goldojarb, and Richard
Engels saw a BlGFOOT-like creature near the
Sycamore Flats campground in Big Rock
Canyon, Los Angeles County, California. It
chased their truck for about twenty seconds, its
long arms swinging in front of its chest. On re-
turning, they found many huge, three-toed
tracks.
In May and June 1973, an apelike creature
terrorized the area around Sykesville in Carroll
County, Maryland. Five-toed, 13-inch foot-
prints were found, separated by a stride of 6 feet.
On June 25, 1973, Randy Needham and
Judy Johnson were parked near a boat ramp on
the Big Muddy River near Murphysboro, Illi-
nois, when they heard a piercing cry that came
from the nearby woods. They looked up and
saw the sound came from a huge shape lumber-
ing toward them. The creature was about 7 feet
tall and covered with a matted, whitish hair.
Others saw and heard the same creature over the
next two weeks, and it reappeared in the sum-
mers of 1974, 1975, 1988, and 1989.
At 4:30 AM. on September 2, 1973, Chester
Yothers woke up and saw a BlGFOOT-like crea-
ture only 5 feet away outside his trailer near
Whitney, Pennsylvania, apparently looking at
the house next door. He woke his wife and
226 HAIRY BIPED
called the police, who arrived shortly afterward.
The monster was gone, but they found wet foot-
prints on the concrete and in the flower bed.
Dennis Smith and Jimmy Slate heard pound-
ing and shrieking noises in the woods next to
Overlook Drive, near Watertown, New York, in
the early morning of August 10, 1976. As the
sun was rising, they saw an erect, black hominid
walking down the road about two city blocks
away. When Smith yelled, the creature turned
around and ran in the opposite direction. Later,
two 15-inch-long tracks, trampled grass, and
some long hairs were found.
On May 18, 1977, two thirteen-year-old
boys were walking their dog near the historic
Roberts Covered Bridge south of Eaton, Ohio,
when the dog got frightened and they smelled a
rotten-meat odor. Turning around, they saw a
9-foot, apelike creature with dirty brown hair,
white eyes, and long arms; it chased them to-
ward the road. Both boys were terrified for
weeks after the incident. Two 1 4-inch, human-
like prints were found near Seven Mile Creek on
a nearby farm.
Some twenty-eight sightings of BlGFOOT-like
creatures 6-9 feet tall were reported in wooded
areas around Little Eagle in the Standing Rock
Reservation in South Dakota from September
to November 1977. Numerous large footprints
were found, and high-pitched shrieks were
heard repeatedly. Cecelia Thunder Shield said
the being was tall with gray, shining hair and a
black face.
In January 1980, an employee of Reynolds
Electrical and Engineering Company saw a 6- to
7-foot hairy creature while driving along a high-
way at the northern end of the Nevada Test
Site. It disappeared in the sagebrush.
James Guyette saw a huge hairy humanoid
walking and swinging its arms along an inter-
state highway near Hartland Dam, Vermont, in
April 1984. It moved down the embankment
and headed west.
A woodsman of Gray Station, Pennsylvania,
was walking at the forest edge at dusk on De-
cember 13, 1986, when something threw a large
piece of wood at him. He looked up and saw a
hairy creature, standing 8-9 feet tall with wide
shoulders and long arms, blocking the path.
After a moment, it turned, stooped, and ran
into the woods.
Gary Lee Hayes was hunting near a tract of the
Houghton Lake State Forest, Michigan, on No-
vember 25, 1990, when he saw a tall, upright
creature moving on the crest of a nearby hill. It
had black hair all over its body and was 7 feet tall.
The creature walked down to a large beaver dam,
squatted down, stood up, then went back uphill.
Robert Toal found huge, human-shaped
tracks in the snow on his property in Kingsville,
Maryland, on the night of February 4-5, 1995.
Field investigators from the Baltimore-area
Enigma Project arrived a few days later and pho-
tographed the tracks, which were 20 inches
long, 11 inches wide, but only 1 inch deep in
the powdery snow. The tracks had an average
stride of 4 feet 10 inches in a straight line and
apparently passed through a 4-foot-high wire
fence. Since even humans weighing less than
200 pounds made deeper impressions in the
snow, the Enigma group thought these were the
full-body impressions of a much lighter animal,
possibly a jumping rabbit.
Early in the morning of March 28, 2000,
James Hughes was driving his newspaper route
near Grafton, Wisconsin, when he saw an 8-
foot hairy humanoid standing by the side of the
road. The creature was carrying something that
looked like a dead goat.
Human tracks 14 inches long and 5 inches
wide were found in early June 2001 on the
Weenusk Indian Reservation at the mouth of
the Winisk River on Hudson Bay, Ontario. The
stride measured 6 feet.
Present status: Distinctions between NORTH
American Apes, Devil Monkeys, Hairy
bipeds, and BlGFOOTare nebulous and possibly
arbitrary. In general, NORTH AMERICAN APES
are tailless and primarily quadrupedal, and they
resemble chimpanzees; DEVIL MONKEYS are
tailed and resemble baboons; Hairy bipeds cover
a wide range of descriptions, from apes to WlLD-
MEN and even paranormal ENTITIES; BlGFOOTis
a robust, tall hominid with a range that seems
restricted to the Pacific Northwest.
Possible explanations:
(1) Many hoaxes, such as pranksters wearing
masks or suits. The Selbyville, Delaware,
HAIRY BIPED 227
swamp monster of 1 964 was admittedly a
hoax perpetrated by a man in a monster
suit.
(2) Mentally unstable or homeless humans
living in the woods. This explanation may
have been especially true for nineteenth-
century reports.
(3) Misidentified American black bears
( Ursus americanus).
(4) Monkeys or apes escaped from zoos or
circuses.
(5) Entities associated with UFOs,
suggested by Stan Gordon and Don
Worley.
(6) Occurrences of BlGFOOT outside its
traditional range in the Pacific Northwest.
The only comparative analysis of Hairy
biped data in eastern North America has
been done by Craig Heinselman, who
looked at 654 reports from fifteen eastern
and northeastern states between 1838 and
2001 and found few differences in height or
other narrowly selected physical
characteristics from the Pacific Northwest
Bigfoot: He arrived at a tentative
population estimate of 210-420 adult
individuals for all fifteen states.

Hantu Sakai
Unknown PRIMATE of Southeast Asia.
Etymology: Malay (Austronesian), “demon
Sakai”; Sakai is a generic derogatory term for
the Senoi, nomadic hunters and gatherers of
Malaysia.
Variant names: Hantu raya, M JWAS.
Physical description: Height, 3 feet 10 inches.
Thick body-hair. White or pinkish skin. Long,
black head-hair. Sad-looking face. Receding
forehead. Projecting brow. Bushy eyebrows. Red
eyes. Long mustache. Long canine teeth. The
back of the forearm is said to have a sharp bone.

heels. Croaks like a bird. Keen sense of smell.
Strong animal odor. Uses forearm to cut foliage.
Timid. Recognizes guns and is afraid of them.
Said to kill and eat humans, especially thin ones.
Wears a bark loincloth.
Distribution: Peninsular Malaysia.
Significant sightings: A. D. Frederickson was
visiting the maharajah of Johor, Malaysia, in the
1870s when he observed a captive wildman that
had been found in the interior. It was allegedly
being taken to a learned society in Calcutta. He
drew a sketch of it for his notebook.
Two males and one female were seen by six-
teen-year-old Wong Yee Moi at a rubber plan-
tation at Terolak, Perak State, Malaysia, as she
was tapping a rubber tree on December 25,
1953. The two males stood behind her as the fe-
male approached and got her attention by
touching her shoulder, offering a fang-filled
smile, and croaking like a bird. The girl
screamed and ran. Over the next few days, the
creatures were seen by five or six others, includ-
ing Corporal Wahab of the Malayan Home
Guard.
Possible explanations:
(1) A surviving Homo erectus, fossils of
which have been found in Java. The
projecting brow is a feature of erectus fossils
but not orangutans.
A captive wildman, or Hantu Sakai, found in the
interior of Malaysia in the 1870s. From Aug Daniel
Frederickson, Ad Orientem (London: W. H. Allen,
1889). (From the original in the Northwestern University
Library)
(2) A surviving mainland population of the
Orangutan ( Pongo pygmaeus), which is now
limited to the islands of Borneo and
Sumatra. Orangutan fossils from around 2
million years ago have been found in Laos,
Vietnam, and southern China, as well as the
islands of Sumatra, Java, and Borneo. These
apes are more distantly related to humans
than are Chimpanzees ( Pan troglodyte s) and
Gorillas {Gorilla gorilla) . The lineage is
unclear, but the likeliest theory is that they
derived from Sivapithecus, an extinct ape
that lived in India and Pakistan in the Late
Miocene 12-8 million years ago. The
arboreal abilities of Hantu Sakai favor this
theory.

1941.
In the spring of 1968, Donald Humphreys
saw a silver-green animal, 24 feet long (later re-
vised to 14-16 feet long), at the southern end of
the lake. It had a large head with one tooth and
a pair of front flippers.
Sonar tracings on an Eagle Z-5000 “fish-
finder” portable device, taken by Michael
Bradley on October 5, 1988, showed two 8- to
10-foot objects swimming side by side and
heading toward the surface from a depth of 54
feet.
Possible explanations:
(1) A stray seal.
(2) A Lake sturgeon ( Acipenser fulvescens ),
though none are officially known to live in
Muskrat Lake.

that run from head to tail rather than down-
ward.
Distribution: Terengganu State, Malaysia.

Harpy
Mythical FLYING HUMANOID of Southern Eu-
rope.

Significant sighting: Phineus, the seer and blind
king of Thrace, was tormented by Harpies sent
by the gods to steal his food and make him starve.
When the Argonauts visited the area (modern
Kiyikoy on the Black Sea in European Turkey),
they drove the birds away to the Strophades Is-
lands in the Ionian Sea. In return, Phineus gave
them some Black Sea navigation tips.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Hoopoe ( Upupa epops) has a
distinctive crest and a call that is a swiftly
repeated “hoop.” It is found throughout
Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia. It is
notoriously foul and unhygienic.
(2) Wood hoopoes (Family Phoeniculidae)
have a preen gland that produces a bad
odor. They are found in Central, East, and
South Africa.
HARPY 231
(3) The Hoatzin ( Opisthocomus hoazin ) was
suggested by Raymond Manners, who
thinks Jason and the Argonauts may have
made it to South America.

Significant sighting: Represented in traditional
Scandinavian folk art as a horse-fish hybrid with
a long, scaly, curved tail.
Possible explanation: The Walrus ( Odebenus
rosmarus) is found in the Norwegian depend-
ency of Svalbard and may have occasionally
strayed to the Norwegian coast in earlier eras.

Physical description: Oxlike body. Skin like a
hippopotamus’s. Short, curled horns. Legs like a
turtle’s.
Distribution: Lake Duobuzhe, Tibet.

Hoan Kiem Turtle
Giant freshwater TURTLE of Southeast Asia.
Etymology: Vietnamese (Austroasiatic), “re-
turned sword,” after the legend by which the
lake got its name.
Scientific name: Rafetus hoankiemensis, given
by Ha Dinh Due.
Physical description: Possibly the world’s
largest freshwater turtle. Length, 5 feet-6 feet 6
inches. Width, 3 feet. Weight, 440 pounds.
Gray, mottled upper shell. Pinkish belly.
Distribution: Hoan Kiem Lake in Hanoi,
Vietnam.
Significant sightings: The turtle’s first appear-
ance was around 1428. When King Le Thai To
was boating on the lake in celebration of his suc-
cessful martial exploits against the Chinese, a gi-
gantic tortoise rose from the depths and pulled
the king’s sword from his hands. Le Thai To re-
named the lake Hoan Kiem (“returned sword”)
because he believed that in this way, the blade
had been restored to his DRAGON protector.
A stuffed specimen of this turtle exists in
Ngoc Son Temple on an island in the middle of
the lake. An amateur cameraman took a video of
three turtles when they surfaced March 24,
1998. Still photos were taken of specimens on
the surface in November 1993 and on March
14, 2000, by Ha Dinh Due.
A 1 -inch x 2-inch egg thought to be from one
of the turtles was found April 7, 2000; an un-
successful attempt was made to incubate it.
Present status: The number of individuals re-
maining in the lake is unknown.
Possible explanations:
(1) An outsize specimen of Swinhoe’s
softshell turtle ( Rafetus swinhoei ), which
grows to more than 300 pounds. The only
known captive specimen is in the Shanghai
Zoo.
(2) The Asian giant softshell turtle
(Pelochelys bibroni ) has a carapace nearly 4
feet long and is found elsewhere in
Vietnam, China, the Philippines, and Papua
New Guinea.
(3) A surviving Stupendemys geographicus,
the largest fossil freshwater turtle, known
from the Early Pliocene 6 million years ago
in Venezuela and Brazil. Its carapace was
nearly 7 feet in diameter.

Hominids
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, before the
methodology of cladistics was defined and the
genetic analysis of relationships in the human
234 HIPPOTURTLEOX
family tree became possible, it was the estab-
lished practice to classify humanlike primates
(Hominidae) separately from apelike primates
(Pongidae). Two classic works of cryptozoology
dealing with sightings of hairy, primitive-look-
ing creatures were written in this transitional pe-
riod by Bernard Heuvelmans ( On the Track of
Unknown Animals, 1958) and IvanT. Sanderson
( Abominable Snowmen: Legend Come to Life ,
1961). Traditionally, human beings (genus
Homo) and their ancestors all the way back to
Australopithecus were placed in the Hominidae,
and the great apes (except the gibbons) were
classed in the Pongidae. Some of the writers who
have consulted these works have not updated the
terminology and the concepts that underlie the
new taxonomy, which may be confusing.
Molecular studies have shown that modern
Humans ( Homo sapiens) shared a common an-
cestor with Chimpanzees {Pan troglodyte 5 ) and
Gorillas ( Gorilla gorilla) only about 7-5 million
years ago. Because 98 percent of the DNA of
modern humans and chimps is more or less the
same and that of gorillas is nearly so, many an-
thropologists have placed the African apes and
humans in the same subfamily (Homininae) of
the Hominidae. At the present writing, all pri-
mates are divided into three suborders — the
Prosimians (lemurs, lorises, and bushbabies),
the Tarsiiformes (tarsiers), and the Anthro-
poidea (monkeys, gibbons, orangutans, African
apes, and humans).
There is still no complete consensus on the
various branches of the human family tree, but
anthropology is resilient and can accommodate
multiple hypotheses until clear evidence is un-
covered. However, this can be confusing at first
to those who haven’t kept up to date with taxo-
nomic theory.
For example, bipedalism was at one time
stressed as a hominid characteristic, but the ape-
like nature of upright australopiths has called this
into question. The discovery of tool use among
chimps and other animals has also led to down-
grading primitive toolkits as exclusively human.
A complex brain and the capacity for structured
speech remain two of the major characteristics
that humans have over apes. After further molec-
ular work is done, one of the following scenarios
will most likely be adopted: (1) humans and aus-
tralopiths will stay in the Hominidae, and every-
thing not quite so bipedal will go to the Pongi-
dae; (2) chimps and gorillas will join humans in
the Hominidae, while Sivapithecus and the
Orangutans ( Pongo pygmaeuh will be reserved for
the Pongidae; or (3) the DNA linkage will be-
come overwhelming, all the apes will stay with
their cousins the humans in the Family Ho-
minidae, and the Pongidae will be abandoned.
For cryptozoology, which does not have the
luxury of examining crania, mandibles, and fe-
murs (not to mention the DNA that orders their
construction), it seems more practical to call any-
thing walking on its hind legs a hominid. Any-
thing that seems uncomfortable with bipedalism
(no matter how brainy it seems or what toolkit
it’s using) will get conservatively lumped into an
unknown PRIMATE category, deferring for the
time being its proper classification.

Homo ferus
WllDM AN of Europe.
Etymology: Latin, “wild man.”
Present status: Homo ferus was the Swedish
taxonomist Carl von Linne’s classification of
what were probably feral children, allegedly
raised in the wilderness by animals. In the tenth
edition of his Systema naturae in 1759, Linne di-
vided the genus Homo into seven racial types,
more or less based on skin color: europaeus
(white), asiaticus (yellow), americanus (red), afer
(black), troglodytes (orangutan), monstrosus (gi-
ants and mutants), and ferus (hairy, mute, and
walking on all fours). His successor Johann
Friedrich Blumenbach dropped the ferus and
troglodytes categories in 1775 and added a
Malayan race (brown) in 1795. These racial
types became the basic anthropological designa-
tions used until the mid-twentieth century.

Homo noctumus
PRIM ate of Southeast Asia.
Etymology: Latin, “night man.”
Present status: Homo noctumus was the
Swedish taxonomist Carl von Linne’s original
classification of the Orangutan ( Pongo pyg-
maeus) in the first edition of his Systema naturae
in 1735. Linne used as a type specimen the
young orangutan described by Jakob de Bondt
as Homo sylvestris (“forest man”) in a work pub-
lished posthumously in 1658.

Homo troglodytes
Primate of Southeast Asia.
Etymology: From the Latin homo (“man”) +
the Greek troglodyta'i (“cave”). See also
Troglodyte.
Present status: Homo troglodytes was the
Swedish taxonomist Carl von Linne’s reclassifi-
cation of the Orangutan ( Pongo pygmaeus) in the
tenth edition of his Systema naturae in 1759.
The type description was also loosely based on
stories of an albino tribe on the island of Ter-
nate in the Moluccas in Indonesia and a white
tribe in Central Africa whose members had
membranes over their eyes. The specific name
troglodytes has been perpetuated in the scientific
name for the Chimpanzee {Pan troglodytes).

HOOFED MAMMALS (Unknown)
Simply put, hoofed mammals have toes covered
with a horny structure composed of keratin that
helps them to run away from predators effi-
ciently. Hooves, like the nails of primates,
evolved from the keratinous claws of other
mammals, such as cats and rodents. Like ballet
dancers standing on point, these animals have
their entire weight concentrated on their toes.
Hoofed mammals have traditionally been
called ungulates (from the Latin ungula, “hoof’),
a group that had a common origin sometime in
the Late Cretaceous, 70-65 million years ago.
Recent evidence that also places the nonhoofed
ELEPHANTS, Hyraxes, and aardvarks in the Su-
perorder Ungulata (as well as the aquatic
CETACEANS and Sirenians derived from ungu-
lates) makes it more convenient to group hoofed
cryptids separately. Most are herbivorous.
The two major extant orders of hoofed mam-
mals are:
(1) The Artiodactyla, the order of even-toed
or cloven-hoofed animals that includes
cattle, deer, antelopes, giraffes, pigs, hippos,
and camels. First seen in the Early Eocene,
55 million years ago, they are characterized
by their elongated third and fourth toes,
which form the primary support for the
limbs. The skulls of living artiodactyls are
elaborately modified for defense, with
canines, incisors, horns, and antlers.
(2) The Perissodactyla, the order of odd-
toed animals, with the middle toe bearing
the primary weight. These animals include
horses, rhinos, tapirs, and the extinct
chalicotheres and brontotheres. This group
diversified in North America and Eurasia to
become the most abundant herbivores
between 55 and 25 million years ago.
Extinct orders of hoofed mammals are the
236 HOMO NOCTURNUS
embrithopods of Oligocene Africa, which in-
cluded the rhinolike, twin-horned Arsi-
noitherium; the notoungulates, South American
ungulates that included the horse- or rhinolike
toxodonts and the smaller typotheres; the
litopterns, also endemic to South America,
which incorporated the long-necked, camel-like
macraucheniids; the uintatheres of North
America and Asia, among them the huge Uin-
tatherium , which had three pairs of bony
swellings on its skull and powerful canine teeth;
the carnivorous mesonychids such as An-
drewsarchus that may have been ancestral to
cetaceans; the astrapotheres, South American
animals that resembled tapirs or rhinos; and the
pyrotheres and xenungulates, little-known
South American ungulates.
Of the thirty-eight mystery animals in this list,
twenty seem related to pigs, hippos, camels, deer,
antelopes, giraffes, or oxen; eleven can appar-
ently be grouped with horses, rhinos, and tapirs;
three may be surviving notoungulates; one could
be a survival into historical times of a litoptern;
and three are too problematic to classify.
Six are found in North America, six in South
America, four in Europe, eight in Africa, twelve
in Asia, and two in Australasia.

Horn Head
A category of Sea MONSTER identified by Gary
Mangiacopra.
Physical description: Long, round body.
Length, 25-60 feet. Dark on top, underside
lighter. Scales like a crocodile’s. Flat, round
head about 2 feet across. Horns. Two pairs of
flippers. Sawlike projections on the back. Tail
forked or tapering to a point.
Behavior: Seen with young. Spouts water.
Distribution: North Atlantic Ocean.
Significant sightings: On November 23, 1869,
while 300 miles off the coast of New England,
Captain Allen and the crew of the bark Scottish
Bride watched a 2 5 -foot-long animal with a
large, flat head and thick scales like a crocodile’s.
A smaller animal, apparently a juvenile only a
few feet long, accompanied the large one.
On June 26, 1904, passengers on the French
Line steamer La Lorraine saw a huge animal
that spouted, churned the water into a foam,
and dived and resurfaced repeatedly for more
than an hour about 560 miles off Brest, France.
Its eyes were huge, it had horns about 20 inches
in length, its head stood 12 feet out of the
water, and one dorsal fin ran nearly the entire
length of its back, which some estimated to be
150 feet long.
Possible explanation: Similar to Bernard
Heuvelmans’s LONGNECK.

Horned Hare
Legendary RABBIT of West Asia, Europe, and
the United States.
Scientific name: Lepus cornutus.
HORNED HARE 237
Variant names: Jackalope (in the United
States, “jackrabbit” + “antelope”), Raurackl
(Old German), Wolpertinger (in Bavaria).
Physical description: Rabbit with antlers or
horns.
Distribution: Western and midwestern
United States; southern Germany; West Asia.
Significant sightings: The horned Raurackl
was generally known to Bavarian hunters of the
sixteenth century and appeared in a contempo-
rary print by Joris Hoefnagel.
German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas al-
legedly shot a Horned hare in Azerbaijan in the
late eighteenth century.
Douglas, Wyoming, claims the dubious dis-
tinction of the first Jackalope taxidermist hoax,
involving a model created in 1934 by Douglas
Herrick.
Present status: Often the subject of obviously
faked photographs and postcards, the Horned
hare has a venerable history going back to third-
century Persia. It was considered rare but real in
the eighteenth century.
Possible explanations:
(1) Photographic hoaxes or taxidermist
hoaxes in which deer antlers are attached to
the head of a stuffed rabbit.
(2) Cranial tumors in the shape of horns or
antlers, which is a disease of Cottontails
(. Sylvilagus spp.) and other rabbits. Called
papillomatosis, the condition is caused by
the Shope papillomavirus and is probably
transmitted by the Rabbit tick
( Haemaphysalis leporis-palustris) or
mosquitos. The tumors are irregular in
shape and can appear on the face, neck, and
rump, as well as the top of the head.

Horned Jackal
Mystery DOG of the Indian subcontinent.
Variant name: Churail (in India).
Physical description: Jackal with a small, bony
horn at the back of its head, usually hidden by
hair. It grows to about half an inch long.
Behavior: Sri Lankan folklore suggests that
only the leaders of a pack possess this horn,
which is called a narri-comboo. The horn is
revered as a powerful talisman.
Distribution: Sri Lanka; India.
Significant sighting: A skull with such a horn
was housed at the Museum of the College of
Surgeons in London during the nineteenth cen-
tury.
Possible explanation: A genetic defect or phys-
ical injury might produce a hornlike growth in
the Golden jackal ( Canis aureus).

Freshwater MONSTERof Quebec, Canada.
Variant name: MlSlGANEBlG
Physical description: Length, 6-30 feet. Head
is like a horse’s.
Behavior: Swims swiftly. Travels on land be-
tween lakes. Tourists used to put cartons of
cream in the water for the monster to drink.
Distribution: Baskatong Lake, Lac Bitobi, Lac

Huia
A perching Bird of the Wattlebird family
(Callaeatidae) of New Zealand, supposed ex-
tinct since 1907.
Etymology: Maori (Austronesian) word, from
its distinctive call.
Scientific name: Heteralocha acutirostris , given
by John Gould in 1836.
Physical description: Black plumage with
metallic green gloss. Length, 19 inches. Orange
facial wattles. Males have medium-length,
sturdy bills; females have long, curved bills. The
difference in bills between the two sexes is
unique among bird species. Both bills are ivory-
colored. Large, black tail feathers with white
tips.
Behavior: Call is soft and fluting. Formerly
prized by the Maori for its tail feathers.
Habitat: Beech and podocarp forests.
Distribution: When Europeans arrived in
New Zealand, Huias were found in the south-
ern half of North Island, from East Cape to
Wellington. Any survivors may have moved
north to the Urewera State Forest or the
Tarawera Range.
Significant sightings: Throughout the 1920s,
some twenty-three unsubstantiated reports were
logged. Signs of Huias were found during an of-
ficial search in 1924, though no living birds
were seen.
On October 12, 1961, Margaret Hutchinson
spotted a Huia at Lake Waikareti in the Urew-
era State Forest, North Island, noting its dis-
tinctive tail.
In 1991, Danish zoologist Lars Thomas
claimed to have seen a Huia in the Pureora For-
est, North Island.
Present status: Presumed extinct since shortly
after December 28, 1907, when W. W. Smith
spotted two males and a female; this is consid-
ered the final official sighting. Scientists and
ethicists meeting in New Zealand in July 1999
agreed to allow the cloning of a Huia, using pre-
served DNA samples.

Huilla
Freshwater MONSTERof the West Indies.
Etymology: Huilla is a common name for the
Anaconda ( Eunectes murinuL) in South America.
Physical description: Serpentine. Length,
25-50 feet. Moss green. Scaly. Horselike head.
Behavior: Amphibious. Swims swiftly by flex-
ing its body into arches. Migrates from one
body of water to another. Emits a high-pitched
whistle.
Tracks: Three-toed.

HUILLA 239
Hungarian Reedwolf
Unknown wild DOG of Central Europe.
Scientific names: Canis lupus minor, given by
M. Mojsisovics in 1887; Canis aureus hungari-
cus, renamed by Gyula Ehik in 1938.
Variant name: Rohrwolf (German).
Physical description: Like a small wolf.
Distribution: Hungary; eastern Austria.
Present status: Apparently became extinct in
the early twentieth century. Some museum
specimens exist.
Possible explanations:
(1) A diminutive subspecies of Gray wolf
( Canis lupus), first suggested by M.
Mojsisovics and now the generally accepted
identification.

HYENAS (Unknown)
Hyenas (Family Hyaenidae) are long-legged,
long-necked scavengers and carnivores with
large eyes and ears, blunt snouts, high shoulders
and low hindquarters, shaggy coats, and short
tails. They probably originated in the Late
Oligocene, 25 million years ago, from relatives
of the CIVETS in Africa or Eurasia, parallel to the
development of DOGS in North America. They
were a diverse group that ranged from Europe to
Africa and Indonesia, and one species (Pachycro-
cuta brevirostris) grew as large as lions and ulti-
mately specialized in the ability to crush, swal-
low, and digest large mammal bones and teeth.
The only hyaenid in North America was the
extinct genus Chasmaporthetes, also known from
Eurasia and Africa. It lived from the Pliocene to
the Pleistocene, 2 million-10,000 years ago,
and was not a bone-cracker; its teeth were more
adapted to slicing flesh.
There are only four extant species, all found
in Africa. The largest is the Spotted hyena ( Cro-
cuta crocuta ), which grows to a body length of 5
feet 9 inches. The others are the Striped hyena
(Hyaena hyaena), also found in Arabia and
India; the Brown hyena (H. brunnea ); and the
more distantly related Aardwolf (Proteles crista -
tus), which feeds on about 250,000 termites in a
single night.
Of the eight hyaenids in this section, three
could be explained by the striped hyena, three
could be surviving Chasmaporthetes, one could
be a surviving Pachycrocuta, and one seems to be
an unknown variety.

Hyraxes (Order Hyracoidea) are rabbit-sized
animals that have no visible tail and look like
guinea pigs. The forefeet have four toes bearing
240 HUNGARIAN REEDWOLF
blunt, hooflike nails; the hind feet have three
toes, two with nails and the third with a curved
claw. They were once grouped with the RO-
DENTS and later with the ELEPHANTS to which
they are closely related. Thomas Huxley was the
first to put them into an independent order of
their own. Current molecular studies show a
close connection to both the proboscideans and
the perissodactyls (HOOFED Mammais).
There are three existing genera of hyraxes, all
living in Africa: Rock hyraxes ( Procavia :), Bush
hyraxes ( Heterohyrax ), and Tree hyraxes {Den-
drohyrax). All three flourish in forested and
rocky environments that hoofed mammals have
difficulty with. These are only a small percent-
age of hyracoids that lived in the early Cenozoic,
when they were the dominant herbivores in
Africa. At that time, some were as large as rhi-
noceroses, including Titanohyrax and Kvabebi-
hyrax. The earliest known hyraxes lived in
Tunisia and Algeria in the Middle Eocene, 45
million years ago. The three cryptids in this sec-
tion are ambiguously described but might rea-
sonably be identified as hyraxes.

Physical description: Long fingernails. Shaggy,
uncut hair.
Behavior: Eats dried fishes. Wears animal
skins. Does not engage in trade.
Distribution: Sudan; Ethiopia; northwestern
India.
Possible explanation: Any number of indige-
nous peoples in Africa and India have a high
proportion of fish in their diets.

Iemisch
OlTERl ike animal of South America.
Etymology: Tehuelche (Chon), “water tiger,”
also used for the Marine otter ( Lontra felind).
Probably not “little pebbles,” as Florentino
Ameghino claimed.
Scientific names: Neomylodon listai, given by
Ameghino in 1898, based on the fossil Mylodon
hide from the Cueva del Milodon and Ramon
Lista’s sighting; Iemisch listai, given by Santiago
Roth in 1899 based on the femur of an extinct
jaguar found in the cave.
Variant names: Chimchimen, Erefilu, Guari-
filu, Hymche, Jemechim, Jemisch, Nerrefilu,
Nervelu, Nguriivilu, Niribilu, Nirribilu, Nurii-
filu (Mapudungun/Araucanian), Yem’chen,
Yenische, Zorro-vibora (Spanish, “fox -viper,”
also used by Araucanian speakers).
Physical description: Size of a puma . Covered in
short, coarse hair. Bay or dark brown color.
Short, round head. Circl e of 1 ight hair around the
eyes extending to the ear-hole. No external ears.
Big canine teeth. Short, plantigrade feet. Three
webbed toes on the forefeet, four webbed toes on
the hind feet. Long, fl at, otterl ike, suppl e tail .
Behavior: Nocturnal . Aquatic. Digs a burrow.
Seizes horses and drowns them Said to drag hu-
mans into the water.
Tracks: Catlike.
Distribution: Lago Col hue Huapi, Rio Sen-
guer, and Estancia Valle Huemeles, in Chubut
Province, Argentina; Santa Cruz Province, Ar-
gentina; Aisen del General Carlos Ibanez del
Campo Region, Chile. Formerly ranged north
to the Rio Negro Province, Argentina, and in
the south to lakes on the eastern slopes of the
Andes Mountains and the Straits of Magellan.
Significant sighting: Ramon Lista came across
a large animal that looked like a giant Pangolin
( Manis spp.) with hair instead of scales in Ar-
gentina’s Santa Cruz Province in the 1870s.
Bull ets fail ed to penetrate the animal ’s skin.
Possible explanations:
(1) An undetermined species of giant
ground sloth, according to Florentino
Ameghino, who was determined to show
that the bones and tough, red-haired skin
found in a cave now known as the Cueva
del Mil odon (24 kil ometers north of Puerto
Natal es in Chile) were from an animal the
Indians knew as Iemisch. However, the
amphibious, carnivorous, web-footed
Iemisch doesn’t seem to match a terrestrial,
vegetarian, huge-clawed sloth. The Mylodon
243
remains have been reliably carbon-dated to
13,000-8,600 years ago, though some
stratigraphic evidence indicates ground
sloths survived as recently as 3000 B.G
(2) An aquatic rep til e with the head of a
fox, suggested by Esteban Erize.
(3) An unknown species of large otter or a
surviving population of the Giant otter
(. Pteronura brasiliensis) , which is now largely
restricted to the Amazon watershed and
grows to a length greater than 5 feet,
incl uding the tail .
(4) A confusion between the Marine otter
( Lontra felina ) and the Jaguar (Panthera
onca ), which once existed in Patagonia and
grows to a ful 1 1 ength of 6 feet.
(5) Exaggerated accounts of the Southern
river otter ( Lontra provocax), widely
distributed in southern Chile and Argentina
until the early twentieth century but now
endangered and officially found only in
isolated pockets in the southwestern fjords
area. However, this animal may persist as far
north as the Rio Colorado and La Pampa
Province, Argentina. It has a long body, flat
head, small ears, and a broad, whiskered
muzzl e. It grows to nearly 4 feet 1 ong,
incl uding the tail , and has strong cl aws on its
webbed feet. Color is dark to very dark
brown above, with a lighter cinnamon below.

June 13, 1983, by William W. Skrypetz from
the Government Dock and Marina.
244 IGOPOGO
A videotape of Igopogo was taken in 1991 by
the captain of a powerboat whose vessel had
broken down. A 1 arge, seal -1 ike animal reared up
out of the water twice, then submerged.
Possible explanation: An occasional seal that
makes its way to the 1 ake.

Physical description: Whalelike or seal -like.
Length, 10-20 feet. Dull gray. Dorsal fin with a
white stripe.
Behavior: Swallows boats, especially those
with red hul 1 s.
Distribution: Lake II iamna, Alaska.
Significant sightings: Babe Alsworth and Bill
Hammersley were flying over the lake in Sep-
tember 1942 when they noticed several dozen
grayish animals with large, blunt heads. Their
size was well over 10 feet.
In 1963, a biologist from the Alaska Depart-
ment of Fish and Game was flying his plane
over the lake and spotted an animal 25-30 feet
long that was swimming below the surface. It
did not come up for air during the ten minutes
he watched it.
Air- taxi pilot Tim La Porte was flying above
Pedro Bay in 1977 when he and his two passen-
gers saw a dark, 12- to 1 4-foot animal on the
surface. It dived straight down and revealed a
large vertical tail.
On July 27, 1987, Verna Kolyaha saw a 10-
foot, black fish with a white stripe along its fin.
The next day, Jerry Pippen observed a 1 arge seal
spouting water.
Possible explanation: A large Green sturgeon
(. Acipenser medirostris ) , which grows to 7 feet
long, or a White sturgeon (A. transmontanus ) ,
which grows to 20 feet. Sturgeons have not been
recorded in II iamna, but they are known in
other Alaskan lakes and coastal waters as far
north as Cook Inlet.

Ink Monkey
Small Primate of East Asia.
Etymology: So named because it had been
trained by Chinese schol ars to grind and prepare
ink, turn manuscript pages, and fetch brushes
when needed.
Variant name: Pen monkey.
Physical description: Length, 4-5 inches. Soft,
jet-bl ack fur. Scarl et eyes.
Behavior: Intel 1 igent enough to be trained as a
scribal assistant. Sleeps in the scholar’s desk
drawer or brush pot. Drinks the india ink 1 eft
over when the scholar is finished writing.
Distribution: China.
Significant sightings: Used by scholars from
2000 B.G to at least the time of Zhu Xi (a.D.
1130-1200).
A news item in the Chinese People’s Daily of
April 22, 1996, announced the rediscovery of
the Ink monkey in the Wuyi Shan Mountains,
Pujian Province, China. Beyond noting that the
animal was no 1 arger than a mouse and weighed
7 ounces, no other details were released. How-
ever, the story may actually refer to an earlier
announcement of the discovery in the Yuanqu
basin, southern Shanxi Province, of a mandible
of the fossil Eosimias centennicus, a tarsier-like
primate weighing 3.5 ounces that lived in the
Eocene, 40 million years ago.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Slow 1 oris ( Nycticebus coucang),
suggested by Cyril Rosen, is found in
southern China and Indonesia and grows
up to 15 inches 1 ong.
(2) An unknown species of Tarsier ( Tarsius
spp.) indigenous to China, perhaps even a
surviving Eosimias centennicus. Pirst
discovered in May 1995 by Chris Beard,
this primate’s chin was deep and robust like
a monkey’s, and its canine teeth projected

Inkanyamba
F RESHmiER Monster of South Africa.
Etymology: Xhosa (Bantu), “tornado.”
Variant names: Howie.
Physical description: Serpentine. Length, up to
25 feet. Head is like a snake’s or a horse’s. Long
neck. Mane of skin.
Behavior: Moves from one body of water to
another in the summer. Often seen in misty
conditions. Blamed for the loss of livestock and
storm damage.
Distribution: The pool below Howick Falls,
Midmar Dam in the Umgeni River, the Mko-
mazi River, and dams in the Dargle area, all in
KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa.
Significant sightings: In 1962, a game ranger
named Buthelezi saw a horse-headed animal
lying on a sandbank in the Umgeni River.
Caretaker Johannes Hlongwane saw the
Howick monster twice, both times in misty
conditions, in 1974 and 1981.
In September 1995, restaurant owner Bob
Teeney saw a large, serpentine animal from the
viewing platform at Howick Falls. Teeney of-
fered a reward to anyone who could produce a
photo of the animal , which created much media
interest.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Nile crocodile ( Crocodylus niloticus)
is found as far south as northern Natal , but
it doesn’t 1 ook particul a rly serpentine.
(2) The African longfin eel ( Anguilla
mossambica) grows up to 5 feet 1 ong, is ol ive
to grayish-black, and has a long dorsal fin.
It is found in eastern rivers of South Africa.
(3) The Giant mottled eel (A. marmoratd)

INSECTIVORES (Unknown)
Insectivores are an odd lot of small mammals
with primitive features and an uncertain 1 ineage.
Included in this grouping are hedgehogs, ten-
recs, shrews, moles, golden moles, solenodons,
and nesophontids. All share a simplified gut, a
reduced area of contact between the pubic
bones, and small teeth with pointed cusps.
However, a common insectivore ancestor has
not been identified in Cretaceous fossils.
Of the four cryptids in this group, two are from
Madagascar, one is from South America, and the
last is an entire family from the West Indies.

INVERTEBRATES (Unknown)
Most unknown animals of interest to cryptozo-
ology are vertebrates, or animals with back-
bones. Invertebrates encompass more than
thirty phyla, ranging from sponges and jellyfish
to worms, insects, spiders, mollusks, and
starfish. Animals without backbones attract our
attention when they are of unusual size or found
in odd environments; this is especially true of
the CEPHALOPODS (a cl ass of mol 1 usks containing
octopuses and squids), which have been placed
in their own section. The remaining thirteen in-
vertebrate cryptids are in four phyla.
In the Phyl umHemichordata (acorn worms),
the giant ACORN WORMS are the undiscovered
adults of a known species of larvae, while the
LOP HENTEROP NEUST bel ongs to an undescribed
INVERTEBRATES 247
deep-sea group. In the Phyl umCnidaria (corals
and jellyfish) are the G I ANT JELLYFISH and the
CUERD (which may also be an octopus). The
PhylumArthropoda (animals with jointed legs)
in cl udes the sea spiders (Deep-Sea Spider), myr-
iapods (Giant Centipede), arachnids (Giant
Spider), insects (Golden ANTand giant Mada-
gascan Hawk Moth), and crustaceans (MAG-
GOT and Specs). The Phyl um Annel ida (seg-
mented worms) may be appropriate for the
Mongolian Death Worm (more 1 ikely a snake
or lizard) and The Thing (a polychaete worm).

Ipupiara
MERBEING of South America.
Etymology: Guarani (Tupi), “water dweller.”
Variant names: Hipupiara, Iara (for the fe-
male), Igpupiara, Oyara, Uiara.
Physical description: Covered in short brown
hair. Females have long, beautiful head-hair.
Deep, sunken eyes. Whiskers. B1 owhol e is at the
back of the head. Tail fins.
Behavior: Moans. Kills victims by constric-
tion. Eats only the eyes, nose, tips of toes and
fingers, and genitals.
Distribution: Coast of Brazil .
Significant sightings: In 1554, Baltasar Fer-
reira encountered an Ipupiara moving along the
beach near Sao Vicente, Brazil . He kil 1 ed it with
his sword, al though it put up some resistance. It
was completely covered with hair and had
whiskers and tail fins.
Anatomist Pieter Pauw (1564-1617) dis-
sected a merman brought to him by merchants
of the Dutch East Indies Company, who had al -
legedly captured it off the coast of Brazil. The
corpse had a human head and torso, but the
lower extremity was a shapeless, tailless mass of
flesh. One hand and some ribs wound up in
Danish physician Thomas Bartholin’s “cabinet
of curiosities,” an early museum of anatomical
and zoological oddities. The hand’s fingers were
webbed, and the knucklebones were robust.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Boto dolphin (Inia geoffrensis) is
found in the Amazon and Orinoco River
basins. Its flipper might be mistaken for a
human hand, according to Michel Meurger.
In Amazonian myth, the Boto is said to be
able to interbreed with humans, producing
hybrids.
(2) The merman corpse may have been a
genetically malformed human suffering
from sirenomel ia , in which the limbs are
fused throughout their length and no
separate feet are present.

Irish Deer
Mystery deerlike HOOFED Mammal of Ireland.
Physical description: Large, black deer.
Distribution: Ireland.
Significant sighting: A bl ack deer was hunted by
ancient Irish tribes who used its skin for clothing
and its meat and milk for food. Centuries ago, a
human body was found in gravel under 1 1 feet of
peat and compl etel y cl othed in antique garments
of hair, said to be that of the legendary deer.
248 IPUPIARA
Possible explanations:
(1) Surviving giant Irish deer (. Megaloceros
giganteus ), which stood 4 feet 6 inches-5
feet at the shoulder and carried enormous
anders that attained a span of nearly 12 feet
and weighed up to 100 pounds. Irish deer
skulls found at Lough Gur, Limerick
County, in 1846 seem to have been
tampered with by humans; however, this
could have occurred at any time during the
recent past. Evidence exists elsewhere that
this huge deer persisted beyond its
extinction in Ireland 10,500 years ago, in
the Late Pleistocene. Fossils on the Isle of
Man have recently been dated at 9,200
years ago. See also SCHELCH.
(2) By contrast, some of the Irish skulls may
actually belong to Moose {Alces alces) that
formerly existed in Ireland.
(3) A large, black-coated variety of Red deer
( Cervus e lap has) might have been hunted by
the ancient Irish.

Irish Wildcat
Undescribed small CATof Ireland.
Physical description: Twice the size of a do-
mestic cat. Dirty-gray color. Tapering tail .
Distribution: Western and northern Ireland.
Significant sightings: William Thompson ex-
amined a 1 arge cat weighing 10 pounds 9 ounces
that had been shot in the early nineteenth cen-
tury in Shane’s Castle Park, near Randal stown,
County Antrim, Northern Ireland. It had a
pointed tail , not bushy at the tip.
In 1883, W. B. Tegetmeier exhibited a speci-
men at the Zoological Society of London that
looked like a domestic cat but had a distinctive
tail and feet. It had been obtained in County
Donegal .
Subfossil remains of what were at first
thought to be wildcats were found in Eden vale,
Newhall, and Barntick Caves, County Clare, in
1904. These, however, turned out to be domes-
tic cats from the Irish Bronze Age, 2000-500
B.G In 1965, A. W. Stelfox reported that these
were the earliest known cat remains in Ireland.
In the summer of 1968, Lionel Leslie and
others saw a large cat from a distance of 100
yards near Lough Nahooin, County Galway.
Present status: Only a handful of sightings are
on record.
Possible explanations:
(1) Feral Domestic cats ( Felis silvestris catus)
are the likeliest candidates, rather than a
native Irish wil dcat.
(2) Introduced African wildcat (F. s. lybica ),
the wild ancestor of domestic cats.
(3) Thompson thought the Shane’s Castle
cat was a European wildcat x Domestic cat
hybrid, though there woul d have to be a
native wildcat population for this to occur.

Irizima
Dinosaur-like animal of Central Africa, similar
to the Mokele-Mbembe.
IRIZIMA 249
Etymology: Unknown, “the thing that may
not be spoken of.”
Physical description: Larger than a hippopota-
mus. Black. Long neck. Said to have rhinolike
horns.
Behavior: Produces 3-foot-high waves in the
water with its breathing.
Habitat: Swamps.
Distribution: Lake Edward, in both the De-
mocratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda.
Possible explanation: A waterspout, suggested
by E. A. Temple- Perkins.

Irkuiem
Unknown Bear of Siberia.
Etymology: Koryak or Chukot (Chukotko-
Kamchatkan), “trousers pulled down.”
Variant names: Irquiem, Kainyn-kutkho
(“god-bear”).
Physical description: General shape of a pol ar
bear. Shoulder height, 4 feet 7 inches. Weight,
more than 2,000 pounds. White coat. Narrow
body. Small head. Long forelegs. A bulge of fat
hangs down between the short hind legs.
Behavior: Does not run but is said to move by
throwing down its front legs and heaving the
hind legs forward to meet them Said to cross
the Chukchi Sea to Alaska via ice floes.
Habitat: Tundra.
Distribution: Olyutorskiy, Karaginskiy, and
Tigil ’areas of the Kamchatka Peninsul a, Koryak
Autonomous Province, Siberia.
Significant sightings: Soviet hunter Rodion
Sivolobov collected eyewitness accounts of the
Irkuiem in the 1970s and 1980s, and in the
spring of 1987, he obtained a skin. A photo of
this skin (or another one like it) was examined by
Val erii Qrl ov, who thought it was that of a Brown
bear ( Ursus arctos). Reindeer hunters are said to
have killed specimens in 1976, 1980, and 1982.
Possible explanations:
(1) The fossil Short- faced bear ( Arctodus
simus) was 9 feet 6 inches 1 ong and 5 feet 7
inches high at the shoulder. An active
carnivore with a short, broad muzzle,
Arctodus coul d run swiftly and was a
fearsome predator. It lived 44,000-11,500
years ago and ranged from Ala ska to
Mexico. First suggested as a possibility by
Soviet zoologist Nikolai K. Vereshchagin.
However, the Irkuiem s peculiar locomotion
does not match the swift movements of
Arctodus.
(2) A stray Pol ar bear ( Ursus maritimus) or
an isolated population of these bears on
Kamchatka, suggested by Val erii Orlov.

Isiququmadevu
Dinosaur-like animal of Central Africa, similar
to the Mokele-Mbembe.
Etymology: Lozi (Bantu) word.
Variant names: Ing’ondotuya, Lengol engol e,
Lingongol e.
Physical description: Length, 20-40 feet.
Larger than an elephant. Head is like a snake’s.
Long neck. Lizardl ike 1 egs.
Behavior: Amphibious.
Tracks: Makes wide furrows in the reeds and
mud.
Habitat: Swamps, rivers.
Distribution: Zambezi River from the Barotse
Floodplain to Victoria Falls, Zambia.
Significant sightings: Lewanika, king of Barot-
seland in western Zambia in the early twentieth
century, went to the spot where a huge, aquatic
reptile had been seen. He found a large space
where reeds had been flattened and a channel as
large as a trek wagon where it had crawled
through the mud.
In the southern summer of 1925, a river-
transport manager named V. Pare saw a 30- to
40-foot, snakelike animal with a slate-gray head
resting on a rock in the flooded Zambezi River
250 IRKUIEM
near Victoria Falls, Zambia. It disappeared into
a deep cave.
E. C. Saunders watched two animals with
long necks in the Zambezi River near Ka tomb-
ora, Zambia, in January 1960. He estimated
they were 20-25 feet 1 ong and did not 1 ook 1 ike
pythons.
Possible explanations:
(1) An outsize African clawless otter (. Aonyx
capensis) may be the source of Pare’s 1925
sighting, according to Bernard Heuvelmans.
It grows to 5 feet in 1 ength, incl uding its
tail.
(2) Two African rock pythons ( Python sebae)
in coitus probably explain the Saunders
sighting.
(3) A surviving sauropod dinosaur.

Habitat: Mountainous forest at altitudes of
1,600-5,000 feet.
Distribution: Peru, from Loreto Department
in the north, through Yanachaga-Chemillen
National Park, to the Cordillera Urubamba.
Significant sighting: Ecuadorean botanist Be-
nigno Malo saw a large, black ape along the
Ecuador-Peru border in 1985 and managed to
take a photograph before it moved away. The
location of the photo is currently unknown.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Spectacled bear ( Tremarctos ornatus)
is black and lives in the area. It occasionally
climbs trees to reach fruit. However, its
white eye rings would be hard to mistake.
(2) An unknown species of monkey.

Significant sightings: On December 16, 1978,
Toshiaki Matsubara saw a strange whirlpool in
Lake Ikeda and took a series of photos of an an-
imal with humps.

Isturitz Scimitar Cat
Mystery big CAT of Western Europe.
Physical description: Short body. Spotted coat.
Sheathed incisors. Robust lower jaw. Long
limbs. Short tail .
Distribution: Southwestern France.
Significant sighting: In 1896, a 6.5-inch-long
Upper Paleolithic stone statuette of a big cat
with a short tail was discovered in a cave near Is-
turitz in the Pyrenees Mountains of France.
Present status: Extinct but of interest because
it may have been contemporaneous with mod-
ern humans.
Possible explanations: It was 1 ong thought that
the statuette showed a European cave lion ( Pan-
ther a leo spelaea ), which has also been depicted
in cave paintings. Vratislav Mazak believes it
more likely represents a Scimitar toothed cat
( Homotherium latidenf a Pleistocene sabre-
tooth, because of its tail and jaw. If so, this cat
would have survived until around 25,000 years
ago and not died out some 200,000 years ago as
is currentl y thought.

Ivory-Billed Woodpecker
Large Bird of the Woodpecker family (Picidae)
in the southern United States and Cuba, pre-
sumed extinct.
Scientific names: Campephilus principalis prin-
cipalis (in United States), given by Carl von
Linne in 1758; C. p. bairdii (in Cuba), given by
John Cassin in 1863.
Physical description: Length, 20 inches. Tall,
scarl et crest (mal es); bl ack crest (femal es). White
bil 1 . White stripes on either side of the neck.
Large patches of white on the wings.
Behavior: Feeds on wood-boring beetle larvae
that infest recently dead trees. Level flight.
Habitat: Tall bottomland, swamp forest.
Distribution: Historical range was from east-
ern Texas to North Carolina and north in the
Mississippi Valley to Missouri, southern Illi-
nois, and southern Indiana. Scattered sightings
since 1966 have been claimed in Texas,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida, and Cuba.
Significant sightings:
In the United States — John V. Dennis ob-
served Ivory-bills in the Neches River valley,
Texas, on December 10, 1966, and February
19, 1967.
Wildlife artist Frank Shields saw individual

Ivory-bil 1 s near Interl achen, FI orida, on April 4
and 15, 1969; on June 11, he found a distinc-
tive, black-and-white feather that he identified
as bel onging to an Ivory-bil 1 .
In May 1971, a pair of Ivory-bills was al-
legedly seen and one of them photographed by
an amateur birder in the Atchafal aya River area,
Louisiana. However, some have said the photo
shows a mounted museum specimen.
In 1987, Jerome Jackson heard a bird re-
spond to his Ivory-bill recordings north of
Vicksburg, Mississippi, but he did not see it.
On April 1, 1999, zoology student David
Kul ivan saw a pair of Ivory-bil 1 s at cl ose range in
the Pearl River Wildlife Management Area,
Louisiana. Merrbers of an expedition to the area
in the winter of 2002 heard and recorded the
bird’s distinctive rapping but made no sightings;
however, Cornel 1 University ornithol ogists con-
firmed in June 2002 that the sounds were made
by distant gunshots.
In Cuba — In 1948, John V. Dennis and
Davis Crompton discovered a population in the
Cuchillas del Toa Range, and in 1956, George
Lamb found six groups there. Since the 1959
Cuban Revolution, the status of the species is
uncertain.
In 1985, Lester L. Short found indirect evi-
dence of the Ivory-bill in the Cupeyal Reserve,
and on April 16, 1986, he saw a male Ivory-bill
in flight at a distance of only 18 feet.
Giraldo Alayon and Alberto Estrada found
traces in Ojito de Agua in 1986. On the after-
noon of March 16, 1987, the 1 ast positive record
of the species was recorded in the Cuchillas del
Toa Mountains by Alayon and Aime Pasada
when they saw a female woodpecker flying at a
distance of about 600 yards.
Merrbers of a 1988 National Geographic ex-
pedition, which included Ted Parker and
Jerome Jackson, could not find the species, al-
though one individual might have been
glimpsed. Unsuccessful searches were con-
ducted in 1991, 1992, and 1993, but in 1998
and 1999, new evidence indicating the bird’s
presence was discovered in the Sierra Maestra.
Present status: A major decline, associated
with the cutting of lowland hardwood forests,
began in the United States around 1885 and
continued until the 1920s. Considered extinct
in the United States by the 1960s and in Cuba
by 1990.
Possible explanation: The Pil eated woodpecker
{Dry o copus pileatus) is si ightl y smal 1 er and much
more common in the United States. It has a
dark bil 1 and an undul a ting fl ight pattern.

254 IVORY-BILLED WOODPECKER
Jacko
Alleged small BlGFOOT captured in western
Canada.
Physical description: Humanlike. Height , 4
feet 7 inches. Weight , 127 pounds. Covered in
glossy hair 1 inch in length. Long, black head-
hair. Hands and feet are hairless. Forearms are
longer t han a human’s.
Behavior: Makes a half-bark, half-growl noise.
Eat s berries and milk.
Distribution: Yale, Brit ish Columbia.
Significant sighting: On June 30, 1884, t rain-
men of the British Columbia Express line 20
miles nort h of Yale saw a wildman lying close t o
the tracks. They blew the whistle and applied
the brake, and the creature jumped up and
climbed a steep bluff. Conductor C. J. Craig
and others gave chase and after five minutes
t rapped it on a ledge. Craig t hrew a rock at it
and knocked it out, allowing them to haul it
back down wit h a rope. Aft er reaching Yale, t he
wildman, whom t hey st art ed calling Jacko, was
kept for a few days by George Tilbury. A report
that Jacko had been sent to the jail at New
West minst er t urned out t o be false.
Present status: Grover Krantz has suggested
that Jacko was acquired by P. T. Barnum and
exhibit ed as “Jo-Jo t he Dog-Faced Boy” in his
circus, beginning in 1884. However, it is fairly
well established that Jo -Jo was a Russian man,
Fedor (or Theodor) Jeft ichew, born in 1868 and
afflict ed wit h hypert richosis, which caused him
t o have long, silky facial hair.
Possible explanation: Probable hoax, based on
lat er newspaper account s.

Habitat: Favors t he seashore.
255
Distribution: Brazil; Guyana.
Significant sighting: Thomas Pennant claims
t hat t wo Jaguaret es were exhibit ed in London in
t he eight eent h cent ury.
Possible explanations:
(1) Melanist ic Jaguars ( Panthera onca) are
known, but t he black color is also found on
t he underpart s. The spot s are always faint ly
visible at cert ain angles t o t he light .
(2) A black-and-t an or pseudo melanist ic
jaguar morph, as suggest ed by Karl Shuker,
might explain t he dual colorat ion. However,
no modern inst ances have been report ed.

can be very playful. The Kuril Islands serve as a
breeding grounds from May to June; little is
known of t he animal’s whereabout s out side t he
breeding season.

Park ranger John Irwin saw a 6-foot -tall
biped wit h black fur st ep in front of his car as he
drove along t he Mullica River in t he Whart on
St at e Forest , New Jersey, in mid-December
1993. It s deerlike head had piercing red eyes.
In late 1995, Sue Dupre was driving near
Pompton Lakes, New Jersey, when a hopping
animal with an armadillo -like face raced across
t he highway.
Present status : Said t o be t he devilish offspring
of a Mrs. Leeds (or Shrouds) of Leeds Point or
Burlington, New Jersey, in about 1735, this
creature only came into prominence in 1909,
when a wave of sightings made headlines.
Nowadays, any New Jersey crypt id, from an
Eastern Puma to a Hairy Biped, is designat ed
a Jersey devil by t he media.
Possible explanations:
(1) An elaborat e hoax in 1909 designed t o
lower real est at e prices and creat e a buyer’s
market . Ivan T. Sanderson claimed t o have
discovered t he fake feet used t o make t he
foot print s in t he snow. Jersey devil pranks
and hoaxes have been frequent over t he
subsequent years.
(2) A st ray Sandhill crane ( Grus canadensis)
would be t all and weird-looking, but t his
bird no longer wint ers in t he Pine Barrens.
JERSEY DEVIL 257
The Great blue heron ( Ardea herodias) is
about the same size, however, and is a
yearlong New Jersey wetlands resident.
(3) The nocturnal calls might originate from
a Red fox ( Vulpes fulva ), an Eastern screech-
owl ( Otus asio) , a Long-eared owl ( Asio
otus ), or from ice breaking on rivers.
(4) A surviving pterosaur, a fossil FLYING
Rep HIE that supposedly died out at the end
of the Cretaceous period, 65 million years
ago.
(5) Some sightings might be attributable to
a kangaroo, though no escapees were
reported from local zoos.

bearlike creature as he was driving his tractor
near Gayndah, Queensland. It had a long snout
like a wallaby, but it lacked a long tail. Two days
later, his sister, Shirley Humphries, saw a simi-
lar animal ambling across a sandbank by a river.
Sam Hill, a local man who was part Aborigine,
declared that it was a Jongari.

The JOGUNG, a True Giant hominid of Australia. (Harry
Trumbore/Loren Coleman)
Dempster, Clarkson, and Harper heard from
Aborigines at Lake Grace, Western Australia,
about the Jimbra or Jingra, a fierce, monkeylike
animal that killed solitary travelers.
Around 1960, Andy Hoad and Brett Taylor
were prospecting in the Lake Ballard area,
Western Australia, when they saw a group of
huge, gorilla-like creatures emerge from a
stand of scrub. One female was 7 feet tall and
had long breasts and dark-brown hair, while a
male stood 9 feet tall. Hoad and Taylor ran
back to their hut, where they found a 10-foot
gorilla in the process of tearing it down. They
hid until the coast was clear, then jumped in
their truck and drove away. Aborigines in Kal-
goolrie-Boulder told them the gorillas were
called Jimbra.
In June 1970, mountaineers Ron Bartlett and
Frank Sinclair were breaking camp northwest of
Mount Kosciusko, New South Wales, when
they noticed huge, humanlike tracks in the
JOGUNG 259
snow nearby. They detected a strange odor and
felt they were being watched. As they moved
through the scrub, they saw a dark, hairy, 8-foot
figure staring at them. It moved away into the
dense bush.
In 1977, Vince and Trevor Collins were driv-
ing a truck north of Jimberingga Well in the
Great Sandy Desert, Western Australia, when
an enormous, black gorilla emerged from the
bushes into the road, brandishing a tree limb.
In 1989, a 13-foot, hairy giant wielding a
club was seen along Cooper Creek between
Maree and Birdsville, South Australia, by two
carloads of four-wheel-drive enthusiasts.

Jumar
Supposed Hoofed Mammal of Western Europe.
Etymology: From the French jument, “mare.”
Physical description: Mulelike. Head is like a
bull’s. Said to have small, knobby horns. Black
eyes.
Distribution: Southern France; Italy.
Significant sighting: Neapolitan physicist Gi-
ambattista della Porta saw apparent mule x bull
hybrids in Ferrara, Italy, in the sixteenth cen-
tury.
Possible explanations:
(1) Konrad Gesner’s suggestion that the
Jumar is a Donkey ( Equus asinus) x Bull
( Bos taurus) hybrid is impossible, since the
offspring would involve a mating between
two separate ungulate orders, the
artiodactyls and perissodactyls.
(2) The comte de Buffon supervised the
dissection of two alleged Jumars but found
them to be small donkeys.

Jungli-Admi
Multipurpose name for the Yeh, Hindu asce-
tics, or any group of people living in the moun-
tains of Central Asia.
Etymology: From the Urdu (Indo-Aryan) jan-
gli (“wild”) + admi (“man”).
Behavior: Said to use a bow and arrow.
Distribution: Nepal; Bhutan; Sikkim
Province, northern India.
Significant sighting: In May 1940, C. Regi-
nald Cooke and his wife, Margaret, were on the
Sikkim-Nepal border at an altitude of 14,000
feet when they found and took photographs of
tracks in the ground made by a heavy creature
with an opposed toe. The Sherpa guides said
they were made by Jungli-admi.

260 JUMAR
Nimbunj, Nyol (in eastern Victoria), Waaki,
Winambuu (Wiradhuri/Australian), Yuuri (in
New South Wales).
Physical description: Height, 3-4 feet. Up-
right. Brown or red skin. Apelike limbs. Cov-
ered with dark brown or black hair.
Behavior: Runs on two legs. Incredibly
strong. Calls are a series of three barks, “Arroo-
ARROO-arroo,” interspersed with a gurgling
“gu-gu-gu-gu.” Also said to cackle like a
chicken. Guards certain locations. Has super-
natural powers. Protects lost children.
Tracks: Variable. Three-toed or five-toed. In
some cases, similar to a five-year-old child’s; in
others, each toe is about the size of a human big
toe.
Distribution: Great Dividing Range of New
South Wales and Queensland; eastern Victoria;
Northern Territory north of the Roper River;
the Western Australia coast between Shark Bay
and Broome.
Significant sightings: Nathan Moilan’s father
had seen Junjadees in the woods several times
while logging in the Great Dividing Range west
of Tully, Queensland. One night, he and his
brother were sleeping in a bush hut in the Kir-
rama Range when a little, hairy man entered
and attacked them. They wrestled with it until
it broke free and escaped by jumping out the
window.
In 1956, a group of Aboriginal and Malay
workmen were sitting by a campfire at Shark
Bay, Western Australia, when a dark-skinned,
little man about 4 feet tall approached them ask-
ing for food supplies. The Malay pearl fisher-
men refused to spend the night alone along the
coast where these creatures live.
In September 1968, George Gray was sleep-
ing in a bush hut near the sawmill settlement of
Kookaburra in New South Wales when he woke
up to find a little man trying to drag him to the
door. It was 4 feet tall and covered with bristly,
gray hair. They wrestled for several minutes, but
the creature had loose skin and Gray couldn’t
get a firm grip on it.
Early in the morning of June 1, 1996, Gary
Opit heard about ninety loud, barklike calls in
the Koonyum Range of northeastern New
South Wales.
Possible explanations:
(1) A mutant strain of stunted Aborigines,
perhaps outcasts.
(2) A surviving group of pre-Aboriginal
peoples.
(3) A dwarf variety or juvenile Y3WIE.
(4) A supernatural entity.

JUNJADEE 261
K
Kadimakara
Legendary large reptile or MARSUPIAL of
Australia.
Etymology: Dieri (Australian) word.
Variant name: Kadimurka.
Physical description: Reptilian monster. Horn
on its forehead.
Habitat: Marshes and water holes.
Distribution: Lake Eyre, South Australia.
Significant sighting: Said by the Aborigines to
have lived in the Dreamtime, the mythical pe-
riod when the world was created.
Possible explanations:
(1) A memory based on the Saltwater
crocodile ( Crocodylus porosus) that formerly
lived along the southern coast.
(2) A surviving Diprotodon optatum, a fossil
marsupial (the largest known) that lived
from 2.5 million years ago to as recently as
6,000 years ago. It was the size of a modern
rhinoceros, about 1 0 feet long. Its heavy
skull, nearly 3 feet long, featured massive
jaws and a large lower incisor. Its bones
have been found frequently near Lake Eyre
and Cooper Creek, South Australia.
Diprotodon fossils at Riversleigh,
Queensland, bear marks suggestive of
butchery by prehistoric tribes.

Kakundakari
SMAILHOMINID of Central Africa.
263
Etymology: Konjo, Nyanga, and Kanu
(Bantu) word.
Scientific name: Congopithecus, proposed by
Charles Cordier in July 1960; amended to Con-
gopithecus cordieri by Heini Hediger in October
1960.
Variant names: Amajungi (Komo/Bantu),
KlKQMBA (possibly the male or adult of the
species), Lisisingo (Poke/Bantu), Mbatcha
(Tembo/Bantu), Niaka-ambuguza (Lega-
Mwenga/ Bantu) .
Physical description: Height, 2-3 feet. Gray
skin. Covered with thin hair except for the face.
Long, black head-hair shaped in pageboy fash-
ion. No large canine teeth. Short mane along
the neck.
Behavior: Bipedal. Strong for its size. Travels
alone or in pairs or threes. Does not climb trees.
Does not swim but crosses streams by holding on
to a floating log or by using a canoe. Horrible
odor. Eats crabs, ginger-fruit, millipedes, snails,
and birds. Carries a satchel made of leaves to
hold gathered food. Sleeps in caves. Makes a bed
of leaves. Dodges spears thrown at it. Possibly
uses a machete. Gathers wood in the cave as if to
make a fire but apparently cannot get it going.
Tracks: Four- toed. Length, under 5 inches.
Distribution: Kivu Region of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, north to the equator.
Significant sightings: In January 1957, a nearly
dead Kakundakari was found by a hunter south
of Kasese, near the Lugulu River. He brought it
to a village, where it was kept caged until it es-
caped. It was seen by many blacks and dozens of
whites.
Near Walikale, Charles Cordier found a 5-
inch-long footprint close to a cavern said to be
the home of a Kakundakari. The big toe was in
the same proportion as that of a human print,
but there was no trace of a fifth toe.
Present status: Always characterized as rare, it
may be severely reduced in numbers or even ex-
tinct because of deforestation and warfare in the
region.
Possible explanations:
(1) The PYGMIES of classical times, possibly
the ancestors of the short-statured Mbuti of
the Ituri Forest in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo. However, the Pygmies seem
more advanced physically and culturally
than the Kakundakari.
(2) Confused folklore about the
Chimpanzee {Pan troglodytes) or Bo no bo
{Pan paniscuf
(3) Surviving gracile australopith, suggested
by Bernard Heuvelmans. Australopiths were
a family of hominids known from the
Pliocene to the Early Pleistocene, 4. 4-1. 4
million years ago. More than 2,000
individual fossils are known. Australopiths
had apelike skulls, hominid teeth,
pronounced cheekbones, and projecting
jaws. The molars were heavy, with thick
enamel. In Ethiopia and Tanzania,
Australopithecus afarensis males probably
stood about 4 feet 6 inches tall and weighed
over 100 pounds; females stood about 3 feet
6 inches and weighed about 60 pounds.
The arms were proportionately longer than
those of humans but shorter than those of
apes. The chest tapered sharply upward.
Cranial capacity averaged 400-410
milliliters. They had an upright, bipedal gait
but apparently also climbed trees. They
were vegetarians, based on their molar size,
and probably ate leaves, fruit, tubers, seeds,
and insects.
The best-known specimen of A. afarensis is
known as Lucy, found in 1974 at Olduvai
Gorge, Tanzania, and considered by some
anthropologists, notably Donald Johanson,
to be ancestral to modern humans. Other
evolutionary relationships have been
proposed, but there is little consensus on
this issue; it’s likely that generic renamings
will occur as relationships are further
explored.
Bipedal footprints 3. 8-3. 6 million years old
preserved in volcanic ash at Laetoli,
Tanzania, and discovered by Mary Leakey
in 1978 may belong to afarensis. The
apelike and grasping big toe is in alignment
with the others, and the print roughly
resembles the sketch of a Kakundakari track
drawn by Cordier nearly twenty years
earlier.

Kalanoro
Lithe People of Madagascar.
Etymology: Betsileo and Sakalava Malagasy
(Austronesian) word.
Variant names: Biby olona, Kimos, Koko-
lampo, Kotokely.
Physical description: Height, 2-3 feet. Cov-
ered with hair. Head-hair falls to the waist. Fin-
gers with hooked nails. Three toes. Has many
other mythical attributes similar to those of Eu-
ropean FAIRIES and Meebeings. Characteristics
vary from region to region.
Behavior: Amphibious. Sometimes malevo-
lent. Voice like a woman’s. Eats fishes and likes
milk. Said to abduct children.
Habitat: Lakes, lagoons, caves, and forests.
Distribution: Lac Alaotra and Lac Kinkony;
Ankazoabo District; Andoboara Cave; the cen-
tral highlands, Madagascar.
Possible explanations:
(1) Surviving giant lemur, possibly
Archeolemur or Hadropithecus. These lemurs
had short limbs, hands, and feet and were
powerfully built. They probably represented
the same ecological niche for Madagascar as
Africa’s baboons. Weight was 30-55
pounds. However, they apparently were not
amphibious.
(2) The Malagasy equivalent of a MEEBEING.

of black slaves brought to the Philippines during
Spanish colonial times.

Kaptar
Wiidman of West Asia.
Etymology: Avar (North East Caucasian) word.
Variant names: Kara-pishik, Keetar, Kheeter,
Meshe-adam (Azerbaijani/Turkic, “forest man”),
Tukhli-adam, Veshshi-adam.
Physical description: Height, 5-7 feet. Cov-
ered in 1 -inch-long hair. Color varies from red-
dish-brown in smaller individuals to dark
brown, dark gray, black, and silvered. Head-hair
reaches to shoulders. Only slightly hairy on the
face. Wide shoulders. Slightly stoop-shouldered.
Long arms. Palms and soles free of hair. Fingers
thick and large. Females have breasts.
Behavior: Bipedal. Cry consists of several re-
peated high- and low-pitched sounds, some-
what plaintive. Prefers the cold; sweats in a
warm environment. Harbors body lice unlike
those found on humans. Bathes in rivers.
Tracks: Length, 9-10 inches. Large big toe,
3.5 inches long. Other four toes slightly splayed.
Narrower at the heel.
Distribution: Dagestan Republic, Russia;
Caucasus Mountains, Azerbaijan.
Significant sightings: In December 1941, Lt.
Col. Vazghen Sergeyevich Karapetian of the So-
viet Army Medical Corps inspected a captured
wiidman 18 miles from Buynaksk in Dagestan,
Russia. It was brought to him because local au-
thorities thought it might be a German spy in
disguise. The creature was nearly 6 feet tall and
covered with shaggy, brown fur like a bear’s.
Karapetian gave his opinion it was a wiidman
and no spy, and he never heard anything about
the incident again.
In July 1957, V. K. Leontiev was inspecting
game in an area near the head of the Jurmut
River, Dagestan, when he came across huge
footprints in the snow. That night, he heard
something make a strange cry, and the next day,
he saw and took a shot at a 7-foot- tall Kaptar.
He pursued it for several minutes, but it out-
paced him up a steep slope. He measured and
sketched the many prints it left behind.
On August 20, 1959, veterinarian Ramazan
Omarov encountered a male Kaptar on a moun-
tain path in Dagestan.
On September 18, 1959, anthropologists
Yuri I. Merezhinskiy and Marie-Jeanne Kofman
266 KAPRE
A Kaptar, or wildman, examined in 1941 by Lt. Col.
Karapetian of the Russian Army Medical Corps in the
Caucasus Mountains. (Fortean Picture Library)
staked out a spot near Balakon in northwestern
Azerbaijan in the hopes of photographing an al-
bino Kaptar said to frequent the area. They were
accompanied by an old hunter named Hajji
Magoma. Soon, they saw and heard the white-
haired creature splashing in a stream and mak-
ing laughing noises. Instead of taking its picture,
however, Merezhinskiy shot at it with a revolver
he had concealed. The Kaptar escaped, and
Magoma never took visitors back to the area.
Possible explanation: Hominid fossils from
this region are sparse but promising. An archaic
human mandible has been found at Azych,
Azerbaijan, in association with Early Paleolithic
hand axes. Neanderthal toolkits occur in several
caves in the region, and a probable Homo erectus
mandible 1.5 million-900,000 years old was
found in 1991 at Dmanisi in Georgia.

Etymology: Tsimihety Malagasy (Austrone-
sian) word.
Behavior: Amphibious.
Distribution: Ankaizina Mountains, north-
central Madagascar.

nocturnal Aquatic tenrec ( Limnogale mergulus ),
an insectivore that grows to not much more
than 12 inches in length, including its tail. It has
webbed feet and a flattened tail for swimming.

Kawekaweau
Unknown L IZARD of Australasia.
Etymology: Maori (Austronesian) word. With-
out the final “u” (Kawekawea), it refers to the
Long- tailed cuckoo ( Eudynamis taitensis).
Variant names: Kaweau, Kumi, Moko,
Ngarara, Taniwha
Physical description: Like a large gecko.
Length, 2-6 feet. Thick as a man’s wrist. Brown

have six legs.
Behavior: Nocturnal. Arboreal. Makes gut-
teral sounds. Eats roots and small birds.
Habitat: Lorests, riverbanks, caves.
Distribution: Waoku Plateau; near Gisborne,
North Island, New Zealand.
Significant sightings: A Urewera Maori chief
killed one of these lizards in 1870 in the
Waimana Valley, North Island.
Joe McClutchie claims to have seen a giant
gecko twice — once in the late 1960s and again
in the early 1980s — while driving at night.
In the late 1970s, Neil Farndale and others
were driving at night when their car hit and
killed a huge lizard. It was about 2 feet long.
Possible explanations:
(1) A living population of Delcourt’s giant
gecko ( Hoplodactylus delcourti ), the world’s
largest gecko, known only from a single
specimen of unknown provenance in the
Marseille Natural History Museum. It is a
short-headed lizard that measures 2 feet
long. Other Hoplodactylus geckos live
primarily in New Zealand.
(2) Exaggeration of the size either of one of
the sixty species of native gecko
( Hoplodactylus or Naultinus) , the largest of
which is the 6-inch Giant gecko ( H .
duvaucelii ), or of the 12-inch Otago skink
{Oligosoma otagense).
(3) An out-of-place Tuatara ( Sphenodon
punctatus ), a 2-foot-long, lizardlike reptile
that is now confined to about twenty small
islands off the northeast coast of New
Zealand and in Cook Strait.
(4) A misidentified introduced animal, such
as a Lerret ( Mustela furo ).
(5) A Maori mythological creature.

Kellas Cat
All-black small CATof Scotland.
Etymology: Named by Karl Shuker from spec-
imens found near Kellas, Grampian, Scotland.
Variant names: Black beast of Moray, CAIT
SlTH, Wangie cat.
Kellas CAT known as Specimen K, shot in 1983 by
Tomas Christie near Kellas, Scotland. (Andrew Barker i
Fortean Picture Library)
Physical description: Slender and well mus-
cled. Length, 2-3 feet, with a 12-inch tail.
Weight, 5-15 pounds. Bristly, black fur, sprin-
kled with white primary guard hairs. Small, long
head. Rounded ears. Short muzzle. Large nose.
Large, prominent upper and lower canines.
Paws are long and narrow. Claws are retractile.
Tail is broad and thickly furred.
Behavior: Hunts in pairs during the daytime.
Can swim well. Graceful, loping gait. Feeds on
rabbits and birds.
Habitat: Woodlands.
Distribution: Highland and Grampian, Scot-
land.
Significant sightings: In June 1984, a black,
male wildcat about 3 feet long was trapped in a
fox snare on the grounds of the Revack Lodge
near Grantown-on-Spey, Highland. The speci-
men was lost after it was taken to a taxidermist.
In October 1984, a second, smaller cat
(known as Specimen K) came to light; it had
been shot in January 1983 by Tomas Christie
while crossing the River Lossie near Kellas,
Grampian.
KELLAS CAT 269
In April and October 1985, two other speci-
mens were shot, near Avie and Kellas.
On February 28, 1988, a black wildcat was
caught alive near Redcastle in northern Scot-
land. It measured 3 feet long and weighed 13
pounds.
Possible explanations:
(1) An unknown species of cat. This is
unlikely, since the animal shares the same
well-known habitat as the Scottish wildcat
(. Felis silvestris grampia) and would likely
have been recognized long ago.
(2) A melanistic Scottish wildcat, especially
possible for Specimen K, which is more
slender than a typical wildcat, with longer
limbs, head, body, and teeth.
(3) An isolated population of feral Domestic
cats (F. s. catus). However, the skull, limb,
and dental dimensions are too large for a
domestic cat and closer to those of a wildcat.
(4) Introgressive domestic cat x Scottish
wildcat hybrid, suggested by Karl Shuker.
Continuous mating of hybrids with both
ferals and wildcats could produce a breed
with a distinctive Kellas appearance, whereas
initial crossbreeds more closely resemble
Scottish wildcats, though with longer tails.
The increase in the Scottish wildcat
population since World War I may actually
have been jump-started by hybridization.

Keshat
Wiidman of West Asia.
Etymology: Adygey and Kabardian (Circas-

Physical description: Height, 5 feet. Covered
with brownish hair. Protruding face.
Behavior: Upright gait. Not aggressive but
might attack a lone hunter. Agile. Occasionally
raids crops in villages. Said to engage in barter-
ing with humans and use a crude language.
Tracks: Humanlike but wider than a man’s.
Habitat: Forests.

Ketos
Sea MONSTER of the Mediterranean Sea.
Etymology: Greek, “sea monster” or “whale.”
Variant name: Cetus (Latin).
Physical description: Serpentine. Doglike
head. Lishlike tail.
Distribution: Eastern Mediterranean.
Significant sightings: After a flood, a Ketos ap-
peared on the coast near ancient Troy,
(Janakkale Province, Turkey, and ravaged the
countryside. King Laomedon sent his daughter
Hesione as a sacrifice to appease the monster,
but the hero Herakles arrived in time to rescue
her and kill the beast. A Corinthian vase paint-
ing from the sixth century B .G depicts the inci-
dent, including the Trojan monster, which
looks like a huge skull with forward-projecting
teeth and bony plates around the eye sockets.
KETOS 271
In Greek mythology, Perseus rescued An-
dromeda, who was chained to a rock at Yafo, Is-
rael, where she was beset by a Ketos. Marcus
Aemilius Scaurus claimed to have found the
bones of the monster in 58 B.G and had them
shipped to Rome, where they were reassembled
for display. Pliny wrote that the backbone was
40 feet long and 1 8 inches thick.
Possible explanations:
(1) Adrienne Mayor and others have
concluded the Corinthian vase artist must
have used a fossil skull, perhaps that of an
extinct giraffid such as Samotherium, as a
model. However, the teeth look like they
might have come from a reptile or whale
skull, while the sclerotic eye ring is
characteristic of birds and dinosaurs.
Possibly, features from several fossils were
combined.
(2) Scaurus might have found the skeleton
of a beached Sperm whale ( Physeter
catodori). These whales are still seen
regularly in the eastern Mediterranean.

Kidoky
Unknown PRIM ATE of Madagascar.
Etymology: Malagasy (Austronesian) word.
Physical description: Height, 4-5 feet. Weight,
about 55 pounds. Dark coat. White spots above
and below the face. Face is round and very hu-
manlike.
Behavior: Ground-dwelling, not arboreal.

Significant sighting: Jean Noelson Pascou saw
a Kidoky in the forest in 1952.
Possible explanation: Surviving giant lemur,
possibly Archeolemur or Hadropithecus. These
lemurs had short limbs, hands, and feet and
were powerfully built. They probably repre-
sented the same ecological niche in Madagascar
as Africa’s baboons. Weight was 30-55 pounds.
Hadropithecus primarily ate grasses and seeds,
while Archeolemur ate tough fruits and seeds.

Williams and other ornithologists in Uganda.
Possible explanation: Fleeting glimpses of the
southern race of Ruwenzori turaco ( Tauraco
johnstoni ), which shows little of its red wings in
short flights, was suggested by Jonathan King-
don.

Kikiyaon
Unknown Bird of West Africa.
Etymology: Bambara (Mande) word.
Physical description: Like a large owl. Covered
in greenish-gray fur rather than feathers. Im-
mense wings. A sharp spur juts from each of its
two shoulder joints. Large talons. Short, tufted
tail.
Behavior: Call is a deep grunt like the “uh-uh-
uhu-hoom-hoom” of Pel’s fishing owl ( Sco -
topelia peli). Also makes a noise like a person
being strangled.
Habitat: Dense forest.
Distribution: Senegal.

Kikomba
WlIDMAN of Central Africa.
Etymology: Konjo, Nyanga, and Kanu
(Bantu) word.
Scientific names: Paranthropus congensis y pro-
posed by Charles Cordier in 1963; Kikomba
leloupi, suggested by Bernard Heuvelmans in
1980.
Variant names: Abamaanji, Apamandi
(Komo/Bantu), KAKUNDAKARI (possibly the fe-
male or young individuals), Tshingombe
(Tembo/Bantu), Zaluzugu (Lega-Mwenga/
Bantu) .
Physical description: Height, 5 feet 2 inches.
Light skin. Covered in black hair. Long, black
head-hair. Broad shoulders. Pronounced sexual
dimorphism, if the KAKUNDAKARI is indeed the
female.
Behavior: Bipedal. Uses a walking stick.
Holds its long hair away from its eyes while
walking. Howls more terrifyingly than a gorilla.
Sometimes screams or barks like a Water
chevrotain ( Hyemoschus aquaticuf Steals game
from traps. Eats honey from beehives, roots, and
ginger-fruit. Knocks down trees in search of in-
sects. Said to attack humans either by hitting
them with its fists or an old axe handle or by
wrestling.
Tracks: Length, 8-12 inches. Second toe
larger than the first and third.
Distribution: Kivu Region, Democratic Re-
public of the Congo; possibly in Kenya, if it cor-
responds to the cryptid designated by Jacqueline
Roumeguere-Eberhardt as hominid XI .
Significant sighting: In January 1960, a local
man encountered a Kikomba along a path near
the Umate gold mine in a mountainous area of
Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Charles Cordier drove 45 miles to the spot,
where he found a humanlike footprint 8 inches
long. Another time, near Tulakwa, he found
several tracks 12 inches long.
Possible explanations:
(1) A large, solitary male Chimpanzee ( Pan
troglodytes ) .
(2) Surviving robust australopith, suggested
by Bernard Heuvelmans. Australopiths were
a family of Pliocene fossil hominids that
persisted into the Early Pleistocene, 4. 4-1. 4
million years ago. More than 2,000
individual fossils are known. Three species
of “robust” hominids are known in the
genus Paranthropus: P. aethiopicus (East
Africa), P. boisei (East Africa), and P.
274 KIGEZI TURACO
robustus (South Africa). Five other “gracile”
species have been placed in the genus
Australopithecus. The distinction between
gracile and robust genera is now seen as
unwarranted, since body size is largely
speculative. Robustness originally referred to
the heavy structure of the skulls.
Paranthropus had apelike skulls, sagittal
crests anchoring massive jaw muscles, small
incisors and canine teeth, enormous cheek
teeth, and molarized bicuspids. They were
vegetarians, based on the molar size, and
probably ate leaves, fruit, tubers, seeds, and
insects. P. robustus s cranial capacity was
450-550 milliliters. The few postcranial
bones that have been found indicate a wide
range of body sizes, probably due to sexual
dimorphism. Paranthropus may have had
the ability to manipulate stone tools, which
some think makes them responsible for the
early Oldowan tool industry, dating from
2.6-2. 5 million years ago.
(3) Surviving Homo ergaster y the first known
hominid with an essentially human body
form. A complete skeleton was discovered in
West Turkana, Kenya, in 1984. It lived
1.8-1. 5 million years ago in East Africa. Its
close resemblance to the Asian Homo erectus
has led some to equate the two. Adults may
have been 5 feet 7 inches tall, with slender
torsos, long limbs, and narrow hips and
shoulders. The cranium was high and
rounded, with distinct browridges. The
chewing teeth were smaller than those of
Homo habilis. Cranial capacity was 850
milliliters. A meat-eater, ergaster may have
been the first hominid to fashion a hand
axe, perhaps 1.5 million years ago
(Acheulean culture).

Ki-Lin
The UNICORN of East Asia. One of the four sa-
cred animals of Chinese mythology, symboliz-
ing wisdom and justice.
Etymology: Chinese (Sino-Tibetan) word,
composed of ki (“male”) + lin (“female”).
Variant names: Ch’i-lin, Ki-rin (Japanese),
Qi-lin, Sin-yu (Japanese), Tso’po (in Tibet),
Zhi.
Physical description: Deerlike, though covered
with scales. Multicolored. Single horn with a
fleshy tip. Has a flamelike mane. Sometimes por-
trayed as winged. Horselike hooves. Tail of an
ox. The more goatlike Zhi also had a single horn.
Behavior: Solitary and elusive. Said to live for
1,000 years. Tame, gentle nature.
Distribution: China and Japan.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Indian rhinoceros ( Rhinoceros
unicornis) was well known to the Chinese
and accurately described as a completely
different animal.
(2) A surviving sivathere, a subfamily of ox-
sized giraffids from Eurasia and Africa with
hefty builds, relatively short legs and necks,
and branching, skin-covered horns. They
lived from 1 5 million years ago, in the Late
Miocene, to the Late Pleistocene.

KILTANYA 275
The King cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus var. rex), a variety of cheetah with a thick coat marked by stripes and blotches.
(Fortean Picture Library)
Tracks: Length, 18 inches. Humanlike toes.
Narrow heel.
Habitat: Mountains.
Distribution: Eastern Siberia.

King Cheetah
Large striped C ATof South Africa, once thought
to be a separate species of cheetah.
Etymology: After the regal splendor of its coat.
Scientific names: Acinonyx rex, proposed by
Reginald Pocock in 1927; modified later to A.
jubatus var. rex.
Variant names: Mazoe leopard, Nsui-fisi
(from the Swahili/Bantu chuifisi , “leopard-
hyena”), Rhodesian cheetah.
Physical description: Like the common chee-
tah but with a thicker, silky coat. Marked with
slightly raised black stripes on the spine and
dark blotches on a cream-colored background.
A more pronounced mane. Fully ringed tail.
King cheetah variants are found in the litters of
normal cheetahs.
Behavior: Nocturnal, as opposed to the tradi-
tional cheetah preference for daytime hunting.
Habitat: Forests, whereas the cheetah prefers
open country, from desert to dry savanna.
Distribution: Zimbabwe; Botswana; Mozam-
bique; Northern Province, South Africa. There
is also a report of a single skin recovered from
Burkina Faso in West Africa.
Significant sightings: First brought to scientific
attention in 1926 when A. C. Cooper noticed
an unusual skin in Harare’s Queen Victoria
Memorial Library and Museum. Reginald
Pocock identified it as a cheetah’s but with a
vastly different coat pattern. At least twenty-one
other skins were obtained through 1974.
The first King cheetah born in captivity was
born to normally marked parents in 1981 at the
Seaview Game Park in Port Elizabeth, South
Africa. The DeWildt Cheetah and Wildlife
Centre in North-West Province, South Africa,
obtained twelve live King cheetah specimens be-
tween 1981 and 1987, three of them cubs born
from their breeding program.
276 KING CHEETAH
Possible explanations:
(1) Now generally seen as a single-locus
genetic morph of the common Cheetah
(Acinonyx jubatus) . Lena Bottriell considers
it to be an instance of evolution in the
making: the modified, striped coat provides
better camouflage as the cheetah adapts to
night hunting in dense forests. If the King
cheetahs are separated reproductively from
the rest of the cheetah population for an
appropriate amount of time, they may
actually become a distinct species.
(2) By contrast, King cheetahs may
represent a genetic throwback to the time
when Africa was colder and more forested.

Kipumbubu
Unknown ClOCODIUAN of East Africa.
Physical description: A very large crocodile.
Behavior: Climbs up on the rim of riverboats
at night, seizes people in its jaws, and eats them.
Said to eat about six people each year.
Distribution: Rufiji River, Tanzania.
Possible explanation: Nile crocodiles ( Crocody -
lus niloticus) kill about 300 people every year in
Africa, but jumping 3 feet up onto boat rims is
not a standard feeding method.

Koau
Unknown flightless Bird of Oceania.
Etymology: Marquesan (Austronesian) word.
Variant name: Koao.
Physical description: Similar to a rail. Size of a
chicken. Purplish-blue plumage. Yellow bill.
Stumpy wings. Long, yellow legs.
KOAU 277
Behavior: Runs rapidly. Burrows in the mud.
Distribution: Hiva Oa, lies Marquises, French
Polynesia.
Significant sighting: Thor Heyerdahl and a na-
tive named Terai were horseback riding on Hiva
Oa in 1937 when they saw a seagull-sized, wing-
less bird run along the trail and disappear into
some ferns.
Present status: Possibly recently extinct, the
victim of hunters.
Possible explanations:
(1) Surviving flightless rail ( Porphyrio
paepae) related to the Takahe (P. mantelli
hochstetteri) of New Zealand and known
from subfossil bones discovered on Hiva Oa
and Tahuata in 1988, proposed by Michel
Raynal.
(2) The Spotless crake ( Porzana tabuensis ), a
black rail 6-8 inches long, also called the
koao , suggested by Jean-Jacques Barloy. It
runs swiftly and lives in some valleys on Ua
Pou and Fatu Hiva. However, koao may
refer to both the crake and an unknown
rail.

legs, occasionally on two. Cannot climb trees.
Raids sheep pens. Attacks humans on sight.
Tracks: Five- toed, with one deep claw mark.
Distribution: Lower and Middle Tana River,

Possible explanation: Surviving Giant baboon
( Theropithecus oswaldi ), a fossil baboon that
lived in Kenya 650,000 years ago. The male was
roughly the size of a female gorilla and weighed
250 pounds.

278 KODDOELO
Habitat: Grassy, treeless hills.
Distribution: KwaZulu-Natal Province,
South Africa.
Significant sighting: G. T. Court shot and ate
some of these birds from 1912 to 1914 in the
Entonjaneni Hills near Melmoth, South Africa.
He saw a flock again in November 1960.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Southern ground hornbill ( Bucorvus
leadbeateri ), which has distinctive red
wattles and a black bill.
(2) The Bald ibis ( Geronticus calvus ), which
is a glossy, green color and has a prominent,
bald head.
(3) An unknown species of wildfowl (Order
Galliformes).

Kongamato
Flying Reptile of Central and South Africa.
Etymology: Kaonde (Bantu), “broken boats.”
Physical description: Length, 2 feet 6 inches-4
feet 6 inches. Smooth skin. Black or red in
color. Long beak with teeth. Batlike wings.
Wingspan, 3-7 feet. Long, narrow tail.
Behavior: Said to capsize canoes by diving in
the water. Said to attack and eat people occa-
sionally. It is particularly fond of their little fin-
gers, toes, earlobes, and noses.
Habitat: Caves near rivers and swamps.
Distribution: The Mwinilunga District, the
Mutanda River, and the Bangweulu and Jiundu
Swamps of northern Zambia; parts of Zim-
babwe.
Significant sightings: In 1923, Lrank Melland
described the belief of the Kaonde people of
Zambia that a huge flying reptile with bat wings
lived in the Jiundu Swamp. When crossing
rivers, some of them carried amulets that would
protect them from a Kongamato. When he
showed them pictures of pterodactyls in books,
they identified them as looking like the
Kongamato.
In 1925, G. Ward Price heard stories of a
monstrous bird with a long beak that attacked
people in the swamps of Zimbabwe. When a
man who had been wounded by the animal was
shown a picture of a pterodactyl, he screamed in
terror.
Engineer J. P. L. Brown saw two flying rep-
tiles in January 1956 near Mansa, Zambia.
They had long, narrow tails and a wingspan of
3 feet-3 feet 6 inches. From beak to tail, they
were about 4 feet 6 inches.
A man was brought into a hospital in Mansa
in 1957, suffering from a chest wound. He
claimed a huge bird in the Bangweulu Swamp
had attacked him.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Shoebill ( Balaeniceps rex) looks like
a large, silver-gray stork, 4 feet long, with an
8-foot wingspan and a distinctive, 8-inch-
long, hooked bill. In flight, it retracts its
head and neck like a heron. It is a closer
relative of the pelicans than true storks. Like
all other living birds, the shoebill has no
teeth.
(2) The Saddle-billed stork
( Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis) is second
only to an ostrich in standing height. It has
a 9-foot wingspan and is 5 feet in length. It
has black-and-white plumage and a black
head and neck. The long, upturned bill is
red with a black band in the middle and a
brilliant yellow frontal shield. Its white
breast has a bare, red “medal.”
(3) The Southern ground hornbill ( Bucorvus
leadbeateri) is about 3 feet 6 inches long
and dull black with white primary feathers.
It has a heavy, downcurved, black bill and
bright red skin around its eye and down its
foreneck.
(4) Lord Derby’s anomalure ( Anomalurus
derbianufr a small, gliding squirrel-like
rodent, was proposed by museum director
Reay Smithers. It is only 15 inches long.
(5) A surviving pterosaur, the flying reptiles
of the Mesozoic era. Lossils of Pterodactylus
(wingspan 1-8 feet, short tail),
Dsungaripterus (wingspan 9-12 feet, short
tail), and Rhamphorynchus (wingspan 1-6
feet, long tail) from the Jurassic have been
KONGAMATO 279
The Kongamato, a huge flying reptile of Central Africa. ( William M. Rebsamen)
found at Tendaguru Hill, Tanzania. Only
two pterosaur fossils from the Cretaceous
have been discovered in Africa: a wing bone
of an Ornithocheirus (wingspan 14-16 feet)
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
and a neck vertebra from a species similar to
the giant Quetzalcoatlus (wingspan 36-39
feet but no teeth). However, the fossil
record in South America is much richer,
and since the two continents were joined at
the time, there is reason to suspect more
specimens will turn up.
(6) Carl Wiman suggested that the
Kongamato tradition originated with natives
who assisted in the excavation of pterosaur
bones at the Tendagaru fossil beds in
Tanzania prior to World War I.

280 KONGAMATO
Kooloo-Kamba
Mystery PRIMATE of Central Africa.
Etymology : Mbama (Bantu), either from
n ’koula (“chimpanzee”) or from its call “kooloo”
+ kamba (“speak”).
Scientific name: Pan troglodytes koolokamba,
given by W. C. Osman-Hill in 1967.
Variant names: Choga, Dedieka, Ebot
(Bulu/Bantu), Itsena, Koolakamba, Koula-
nguia (Kele/Bantu, koula “chimpanzee” + nguia
“gorilla”), Koulou-nguira, Kulu-kampa, Kulu-
kanba, N’tchego, Sipandjee.
Physical description: Larger than a normal
chimpanzee. Cranium is larger than a chim-
panzee’s, with some cresting. Ebony-black, prog-
nathous face. Heavy browridge. Wide, flat, fleshy
nose. Small ears. Powerful jaws. Upper and lower
incisors meet squarely. Broad pelvic structure.
Behavior: Frequently walks bipedally. Call is
“koola-kooloo koola-kooloo.” Aggressive. Lives
singly or in smaller groups than other chim-
panzees.
Habitat: Primarily high-altitude forests, al-
though stray individuals are apparently found
elsewhere with normal chimpanzee groups.
Distribution: Gabon; Cameroon; Equatorial
Guinea.
Significant sightings: In the 1850s, Paul Du
Chaillu shot a male Kooloo-kamba in south-
western Gabon. It was smaller than an adult
male gorilla but stockier than a female gorilla. It
had a round head and face, a small nose, and
large ears. The skull is housed in the British
Museum of Natural History.
A 4-foot-tall female ape nicknamed “Mafuca”
was taken to the Dresden Zoo in 1874 from the
port of Loango in the Republic of the Congo.
Several observers classified it as a young female
gorilla, others were convinced it was a chim-
panzee, and still others thought it could be a
chimp-gorilla hybrid. Sir Arthur Keith in 1899
classed Mafuca with Du Chaillu’s Kooloo-
kamba. Some zoologists now think it likely that
Mafuca was a bonobo, which can be stockier
than some chimpanzees.
Louis de Lassaletta collected a Kooloo-kamba
in the hilly Nsok region of Equatorial Guinea in
1954.
Individuals with Kooloo-kamba characteris-
tics have been maintained in the Coulston
Foundation’s animal experimentation labora-
tory in Alamogordo, New Mexico, since the
1960s.
In 1993, Steve Holmes saw a “wildman” in
the Gamba coastal area of Gabon. It was just
under 5 feet tall and running with its arms held
high above its head. Nearby villagers called it
the Sipandjee and said it was aggressive.
Possible explanations:
(1) An unknown species or subspecies of
Chimpanzee {Pan troglodytes ), suggested by
Du Chaillu and E. Franquet.
(2) A Lowland gorilla ( Gorilla gorilla ) with
uncharacteristic individual variations. A
supposed Kooloo-kamba was brought to the
Basel Zoo in 1967, but it turned out to be a
red-backed female gorilla.
(3) A misidentified Bonobo ( Pan paniscus ),
which was not recognized as a separate
chimpanzee species until 1933.
(4) A chimp x gorilla hybrid. Though these
two apes are closely related, successful
hybridization between them is unknown
either in captivity or in the wild. Individuals
with both chimp and gorilla characteristics
merely reflect this close genetic relationship.
(5) A misidentified large male chimpanzee.
Facial color in chimps darkens with age.
(6) A misidentified small female gorilla, the
equivalent of a PYGMY GORIIIA
(7) An emergent variety or species with
adaptations to a mountainous habitat,
suggested by Karl Shuker.

Koosh-Taa-Kaa
CANNIBAL Giant of Alaska and northwestern
Canada.
Etymology: Haida-Tlingit (Na-Dene), “land-
otter man.”
Physical description: Covered with long hair
except for the face.
Behavior: Tries to steal the souls of people
who are drowned or lost in the woods.
Distribution: British Columbia, Canada;
Alaska.

Kra-Dhan
Unknown PRIMATE of Southeast Asia.
Etymology: Bahnar (Austroasiatic) word.
Variant names: Bec’-boc, Bekk-bok, Con liioi
ud i (Vietnamese/Austroasiatic) .
Physical description: Large, monkeylike ani-
mal.
Behavior: Bipedal. Vicious. Has a chameleon-
like ability to change color. Call is an insane
laugh. Attacks humans.
Tracks: Length, 18 inches. Width, 8 inches.
Stride, 4 feet.
Distribution: Annam Highlands near Kon
Turn and Pleiku, Vietnam.
Significant sighting: In 1943, a Kra-dhan
killed a man near Kon Turn, Vietnam.
Possible explanation: A surviving mainland
population of the Orangutan ( Pongo pygmaeus),
which is now limited to the islands of Borneo
and Sumatra. Orangutan fossils from around 2
million years ago have been found in Laos, Viet-
nam, and southern China, as well as the islands
of Sumatra, Java, and Borneo. These apes are
more distantly related to humans than are
Chimpanzees ( Pan troglodytes) and Gorillas ( Go-
rilla gorilla ) . The lineage is unclear, but the like-
liest theory is that they derived from Sivapithe-
cus, an extinct ape that lived in India and
Pakistan in the Late Miocene, 12—8 million
years ago.

Kraken
Giant CEPHAIOPOD of the Atlantic and Pacific
Oceans. Accepted by science after remains that
washed up near Albaek, Denmark, in 1853 were
examined, the Giant squid ( Architeuthis ) was
described officially by Danish naturalist Japetus
Steenstrup in 1857. The largest known speci-
mens of giant squid have a total length, includ-
ing their two long arms, of about 55 feet. The
evidence for even larger animals is considered
here as the legacy of the Kraken.
Etymology: The plural form of the Norwegian
282 KOOSH-TAA-KAA
krake, first mentioned by Francesco Negri in
1700. Possibly related to a word meaning “up-
rooted tree” because the squid’s body and arms
appear similar to the trunk and roots of a tree.
Scientific name : Architeuthis dux, given by Jo-
hannes Japetus Steenstrup in 1857.
Variant names: Aale tust (Norwegian, “tuft of
eels”), Anker- trold (“anchor- troll”), Horv (“har-
row”), Kolkrabbi, Krabbe (“crab”), Kraxen,
Sciu-crak, Sae-horven.
Physical description: In Norwegian mythol-
ogy, the Kraken is a supergiant squid, with a
body 1.5 miles in circumference. It appears like
several small islands surrounded by seaweed.
Dark brown with light speckles. High, broad
forehead. Large eyes. Pointed snout (actually the
tail). Its arms or tentacles are as big as medium-
sized ships.
Behavior: Causes fishes to come closer to the
surface when it rises; creates a huge eddy when
it sinks. Said to attack ships and grasp their rig-
ging with its arms.
Distribution: Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.
Significant sightings: In 1801, Pierre Denys de
Montfort noted that in the chapel of St.
Thomas at St.-Malo in Brittany, France, there
was a votive picture showing a huge squid or oc-
topus attacking a ship by winding its arms
around the masts and rigging. The incident is
said to have taken place off the coast of Angola.
The ship’s sailors made a vow to St. Thomas
that they would make a pilgrimage if he would
save them, then set to work with their axes and
cutlasses to cut off the monster’s tentacles.
Later, they went directly to the chapel in St.-
Malo, where a picture was hung illustrating
their adventure.
Denys de Montfort also interviewed whalers
at Dunkerque, Pas-de-Calais Department,
France, who told him some squid stories. An
American, Captain Reynolds, described a cut-
off squid arm that was 45 feet long and 2 feet 6
inches in diameter. A retired Danish captain
named Jean-Magnus Dens said he had encoun-
tered a huge squid, again off the coast of Angola,
that had attacked and killed three men on board
his ship. The crew sank five harpoons into the
monster before it was finished. Dens estimated
the animal’s arms were more than 35 feet long.
Frank Bullen’s description of a moonlight
battle between a sperm whale and a huge squid
in the Strait of Malacca in the Indian Ocean in
1875 is, at best, exaggerated.
The size of toothed sucker marks on the skin
of sperm whales has been offered as evidence of
extremely large giant squids. However, marks
greater than 1-2 inches in diameter are difficult
to verify. The suckers of the 46-foot specimen
that washed ashore at Bonavista Bay, Newfound-
land, in 1872 measured 2.5 inches in diameter.
Bernard Heuvelmans also cites the great
KRAKEN 283
length of squid arms found in whale stomachs,
as well as a theorized constant ratio between
sucker size and arm length, as evidence for the
large size of certain incomplete specimens.
One of the few known sightings of a living
specimen at the surface involved an animal esti-
mated to be 100 feet in length. In early 1969,
Dennis Braun and two other marines on the USS
Francis Marion watched this monster for more
than ten minutes off Vieques Island, Puerto Rico.

Ksy-Gyik
WlIDMAN of Central Asia.
Scientific name: Primihomo asiaticus, pro-
posed by V. A. Khakhlov in 1914.

(“man”) + giik (“wild” or “powerful”).
Variant names: Kiik-adam, Kiik-kish, Kish-
kiik, Kishi-kiyik.
Physical description: Height, 5 feet. Covered
with dark-brown or yellowish, shaggy hair.
Sloping forehead. Arched browridges. Small
nose with large nostrils. Ears are large, lobeless,
and backward-pointing. Massive lower jaw. No
chin. A hump on the back of the neck. Long
arms. Stoop-shouldered. Female has breasts.
Behavior: Runs awkwardly, swinging its arms.
Screeches. Eats raw meat, vegetables, and grain.
Drinks water by lapping or by dipping its arm
in water and lapping up the drips. Lives in rock
shelters strewn with grass. Sleeps by squatting
on its knees and elbows, resting its forehead on
the ground, and placing its wrists over its head.
Tracks: Short and broad. Splayed toes. Large
toe smaller than a human’s.
Distribution: The Altai Mountains of Ka-
zakhstan; the Kirgiz Steppe around Astana and
Qaraghandy, Kazakhstan; the Chatkal and Alai
Mountains of Kyrgyzstan; the Junggar Pendi
depression in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Re-
gion, northern China.
Significant sightings: The young Russian zool-
ogist V. A. Khakhlov spent much of 1911 and
1912 with Kazakh herders in the area around
Zaysan Koli and the Tarbagatay Mountains,
Kazakhstan, with an excursion into neighboring
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China.
During this time, he collected valuable data
from two Kazakhs who served as his guides and
who had seen the creatures at various times.
In July 1948, a Kazakh herder named
Mad’yer showed geologist A. P. Agafonov the
preserved hand of a wildman that his grandfa-
ther had killed in the Chatkal Mountains of
Kyrgyzstan, probably in the mid-nineteenth
century. The creature had tried to carry off his
young wife, so he killed it with his hunting knife
and cut off the hand as a trophy. Agafonov said
the hand was human and covered with long,
sparse hairs except on the palm. Boris Porshnev
attempted to locate the hand in 1963, but
Mad’yer had died, and his heir pretended not to
know of the relic.
In August 1948, geologist M. A. Stronin was
284 KSY-GYIK
camped in a remote area of the Alai Mountains
near the Inyfchek River in Kyrgyzstan when his
guides woke him in alarm. A Kiik-kish with
thick, yellowish hair was trying to steal their
horses, but it ran away on two legs down an ex-
tremely steep slope.
In the summer of 2001, a Kyrgyz frontier
guard in the Alai Mountains discovered a set of
human tracks 18 inches long and 12 inches
wide in the clay bank of a river.

Laocoon Serpent
Sea MONSTERof the Mediterranean Sea.
Physical description: Red crest or mane. Red
(H oodshot ) eyes. Fl ickering t ongue. Venomous
fangs. Immense coils.
Behavior: Kil 1 s by const rict ion.
Distribution: Aegean Sea.
Significant sighting: The Trojan priest Lao-
coon (responsible for the warning about
“Greeks bearing gifts” in sending the Trojan
horse) and his two sons were strangled by sea
snakes whil e t hey were sacrificing at t he al t ar of
Poseidon on the sea coast. The snakes were said
to have come from Bozca Ada Island, not far
from ancient Troy along the coast of (Janakkale
Province, Turkey.
Possible explanation: The harmless, crested
Oarfish ( Regalecus glesne ), the most elongated
bony fish in t he worl d, is found in t he Medit er-
ranean. Though t his is oft en a deep-sea fish, it is
somet imes found dead or dying at t he surface.

Lascaux Unicorn
Myst ery HOOFED Mammal of prehist oric West -
ern Europe.
Etymology: Unicorn is a misnomer, since the
animal clearly has two horns.
Physical description: Reddish. Large spots.
Square head. Two long, straight horns. Large
belly, possibly indicating a pregnancy. Short
tail.
Distribution: Grotte de Lascaux, Dordogne
Depart ment , sout h-cent ral Era nee.
Significant sighting: A 1 7,000-yea r-ol d Upper
Paleolithic painting of an unident ifia lie animal
exists in the cave of Lascaux, above the Vezere
River valley near Montignac, France. The cave,
with its many depictions of horses, bulls, and
other animals, was discovered in September
1940.
Present status: The cave was cl osed tot ourist s
in 1963, but a partial replica was opened nearly
in 1983.
Possible explanations: Most commentators
speculate that the 17,000-year-old painting
shows an imaginary animal, though the other
paint ings in t he cave are nat ural ist ic depict ions
of real fauna. Others have suggest ed that it
shows a hunt er or shaman dressed in skins t a ken
from different animals.

word.
Variant names: Jak, Jak-anywong (“punishing
spirit,” Dinka /Nilo-Saharan), Nyal (Shill uk/
Nilo-Saharan), NYAMA.
Physical description: Serpent ine but wit h 1 egs.
Size estimates vary widely: 40-100 feet long, as
large as a donkey or a horse, or about 12 feet
long and smaller than a python. Brown or dark
yel 1 ow. It s snakel ike head has a 3-inch-l ong crest
like that of a crowned crane. Some say four
bones united by a membrane appear around its
mout h; ot hers say it has barbel s 1 ike a cat fish.
Behavior: Gall is a loud, booming cry, heard
at night. Its stomach makes loud gurgles, espe-
cially in the rainy season. Lives in holes in river-
banks.
Tracks: Makes a furrow in swampy ground.
Habitat: Swamps.
Distribution: Bahr al ’Arab, Bahr al Ghazal,
Bahr al Zeraf, Bahr al Jabal , and ot her sources of
the White Nile, from Malakal south to Rajjaf
and Lake No sout h t o Shambe, Sudan.
Significant sightings: A 40-foot Lau was ob-
served near Waw, Sudan, in the late nineteenth
cent ury.
In 1914, the complete skeleton of a Lau was
retrieved from the Bahr a 1 Zeraf, and the bones
were distributed among the Nuer people to
wear as charms. A few years 1 at er, a 12-foot spec-
imen was seen in t he Bahr al Zeraf. Loud gurgl es
from a Lau were heard in the Bahr al ’Arab in
1918.
In 1937, William Hichens published a photo
of a wooden effigy in the shape of a La u’s head.
The effigy was apparently used in ritual dances
and was carved by Mshengu she Gunda, who
lived in the Iramba District of the Singida Re-
gion, Tanzania, and had hunted extensively in
the Nile swamps.
Possible explanations:
(1) An unknown species of large Catfish
(La mil y Siluridae) with long barbels, a
dorsal fin t hat coul d be mist a ken for a crest ,
and a long body. Some species of cat fishes
crawl out ont o land at night . They have no
vocal cords but can make a growling noise.
Some have poisonous spines, and others
produce el ect ric shocks. The El ect ric cat fish
( Malapterurus electricus) of the Nile and
t ropical Africa is 5 feet 1 ong, but t he Wei s
catfish {Siluris glanis) of Europe reaches
nearly 10 feet long and can weigh more
than 500 pounds.

Distribution: Mascarene Islands in the Indian
Ocean.
Significant sighting: Huguenot refugee
Francois Le Guat saw large, white birds in the
1690s on Mauritius and Rodrigues. They have
not been report ed since.
Possible explanations:
(1) An unknown species of Rail (Family
Ral 1 idae), now ext inct .
(2) A misident ified Gallinule ( Gallinula
spp.) or Flamingo ( Phoenicopterus ruber),
which is about 4 feet long and has a 5-foot

Least Hominid
Term used by Mark A. Hall for the Homo erec-
tus WlIDMEN to distinguish them from his cate-
gory of Neanderthaloid SHORTER Hom INIDS. He
includes in this category the Aim AS and the Bar
Manu.
Variant name: Erectus hominid.
Physical description: Height, 5-6 feet.
Tracks: Length, 9.5 inches. Width, 4.5
inches.
Distribution: From the Caucasus Mountains
to China.
Possible explanation: Homo erectus lived in
Asia and Africa from the Early to Middle Pleis-
tocene 2 million-125,000 years ago. It was
squat, heavily muscled, and had a long, flat skull
with browridges.

Lechy
WllDM AN of European Russia and Central Asia.
Variant name: Leshi.
Physical description: Height, 4 feet 6 inches.
Dark skin. Covered with hair.
Distribution: From the Vologda Region of
European Russia east to the Buryat Republic,
Russia.
Significant sightings: Seen once by psycholo-
gist K. K. Platonov east of Lake Baikal. Other
sightings have taken place in the Saratov Region
in 1989 and near Kargopof in the Arkhangefsk
Region in 1992.
Physician V. V. Shatalov was attending to a
patient one winter in a remote part of the
Vologda Region, Russia, when he saw a naked,
manlike creature in a courtyard. He observed
that its legs were thin, but it had well-developed
humeral muscles. It ran away in the snow and
hid in an abandoned dwelling.

Etymology: Tanaina (Na-Dene).
Behavior: Comes from the north occasionally
and eats people.
Distribution: Cook Inlet, Alaska.

Francisco Chronicle, February 27, 1876, p. 1.
Leviathan
Sea Monster of the Middle East; see Semi-
m ythi cal Beasts.
Etymology: Hebrew (Semitic), livyatan, from
livyah (“twisted”) + tan (“monster”).
Variant names: Rahab, Tannin, Yam.
Physical description: Enormous size. Tightly
joined scales. Glowing red eyes. Fiery breath.
Large teeth. Strong neck. Has limbs or fins.
Behavior: Raises itself up on the water.
LEVIATHAN 293
Possible explanations:
(1) A whale of some kind, especially the
Sperm whale ( Physeter catodon :), which is
found in the Mediterranean Sea and the
Indian Ocean. Its fiery breath could be the
whale spouting, while raising itself up on
the water could be the animal’s habit of
breaching.
(2) The Nile crocodile ( Crocodylus niloticus ),
suggested by Samuel Bochart, although this
is a freshwater animal and does not live in
the sea. The Egyptians occasionally hunted
this crocodile with baited hooks.
(3) The Saltwater crocodile ( Crocodylus
porosus ), but this reptile only lives in
Southeast Asia and Australasia.
(4) A Multi finned Sea Monster,
advocated by Bernard Heuvelmans.
(5) Karl Shuker suggested a surviving
mosasaur, a group of twenty genera that
includes some of the largest marine reptiles
ever, frequently exceeding 33 feet in length.
They lived in the Late Cretaceous, 95-65
million years ago.
(6) A mythical composite of several large
animals.

Lindorm
Wingless DRAGON or unknown LIZARD of
Northern Europe.
Etymology: Swedish, lind (“flexible body”) +
orm (“serpent”).
Variant names: Drage (Norway), Drake (Swe-
den), Lindwurm (Germany), Vassorm (Nor-
way).
Physical description: Serpentine. Length,
10-28 feet. Body is heavy and as thick as a
man’s thigh. Black color. Head is like that of a
pike fish. Older specimens have a crest or mane
that is black to gray in color and parted in the
middle. Large, saucer-shaped, red or yellow eyes
that shine with reflected light. Short, protruding
ears on the top of the head. Square nose. Lorked
tongue. Mouth is full of white teeth. Sacks of
skin hang from the corners of the mouth. Bris-
tles or whiskers are on the chin. Yellow belly.
Tail is short and stubby.
Behavior: Primarily terrestrial but often seen
in water. Swims with a horizontal movement, its
head 2 feet above the water. Has a hypnotic or
paralyzing gaze. Ill tempered and pugnacious.
Snorts like a horse. Hisses when alarmed. Before
attacking, it contracts its body and then rises up
4-6 feet on its tail and pounces. Spits a poison-
ous liquid. Its carcass has a repugnant stench.
Tracks: Makes well-worn trails that look as if
a log had been dragged along the ground.
Habitat: Lakes, swamps, mountains, rocky
areas.
Distribution: Kronoberg and Jonkoping
Counties, Sweden, including Asnen, Rottnen,
Ojen, and Helgasjon Lakes; parts of Norway
and Finland.
Significant sightings: In the fall of 1826,
Daniel Nilsson, of Odenso, Kronoberg County,
had a difficult and lengthy struggle with a Lind-
orm in the forest of Ulvehult.
Walking to their boathouse in August 1869,
Magnus Bergstrom and Karin Svensdotter no-
ticed a black snake in the grass. After poking it
with a stick, Bergstrom realized it was a Lind-
orm when it opened its mouth 1 1 inches wide
and showed its forked tongue; the creature
hissed, rose upright, and rushed at him. After a
long fight, Bergstrom killed it with a stick. Its
mouth was full of fangs about the size of a man’s
little finger, and it had a mane of scales pointed
like horsehair. The carcass began to stink almost
immediately.
In November 1878, a Lindorm was killed in
Husaby Lorest, Kronoberg, by the farmer Johan
Jonsson of Hakadal.
In 1883, Lindorms were seen near Hinneryd,
Urshult, Kalvsvik, the estate of Skaggalosa Pers-
gard, and Husaby Forest, all in Kronoberg
County, Sweden.
Gunnar Olof Hylten-Cavallius organized a
294 LINDORM
hunt for witnesses of the Lindorm from 1883 to
1885. He uncovered forty-eight individuals
who had memories of seeing these animals from
the 1820s to the 1880s.
Possible explanations:
(1) Said by Erik Pontoppidan to be a
juvenile SEA MONSTER, which travels
downstream to the sea like an eel when it
matures.
(2) Hallucinations, folktales, or
misidentifications.

Lipata
Unknown ClOCODIUAN of Central Africa.
Variant name: Libata.
Physical description: Bulkier than a Nile croc-
odile. Length, 13-20 feet. Eyes are close to-
gether on the top of the head. Mouth is larger
and throat is wider than a Nile crocodile’s. Ser-
rated scales along the tail.
Behavior: Most active at the beginning of the
rainy season or the end of September. Seen on
the water’s surface in the morning and at dusk.
Comes on land only occasionally. Attacks and
eats goats, pigs, cattle, crocodiles, and, from
time to time, humans. Very shy of people.
Women who fish in the river shout to scare the
animal away.
Distribution: Chiumbe and Kasai Rivers,
northeastern Angola.
Significant sightings: Around 1890, the inhab-
itants of the village of Tyipukungu, Angola, set
a trap for a Lipata after it had taken three of
their cattle. The animal took the bait and was
killed.
On September 1, 1932, a man from Tyipu-
kungu saw a Lipata sleeping on dry land around
9:00 AM.
Possible explanations:
(1) Large or old and aggressive specimens of
the Nile crocodile ( Crocodylus niloticus). The
official size record for this crocodile was set
in 1953 at 19 feet 6 inches, though there
are reports of larger specimens. Most rarely
grow larger than 1 6 feet.
(2) An African slender-snouted crocodile
( Crocodylus cataphractus) somewhat south of
its normal range. This reptile grows to 13
feet long, although the average length is 8
feet. It has solitary habits and is most often
found in open water in lakes and rivers.
(3) An unknown species of large Dwarf
crocodile of the genus Osteolaemus, with a
head that is shorter and rounder than that
of the Nile crocodile, suggested by Bernard
Heuvelmans.

Little People
Most cultures throughout the world have
myths, legends, and folklore about small ENTI-
TIES who stand anywhere from 4 feet 6 inches to
only a few inches tall. In the vast majority of
LITTLE PEOPLE 295
cases, these beings are regarded as primarily su-
pernatural, although they may leave physical
traces and do other things that humans do — eat
food, wear clothes, use weapons, speak a lan-
guage, and worship gods. Little people often
represent the world lived in by children: they are
imperfectly understood, inferior, and yet com-
pelled to do the bidding of adults.
The literature on Little people is vast. De-
scriptions vary widely depending on the envi-
ronment and local belief systems. Some cultures
have difficulty distinguishing between the real
and the mythic worlds, and the cryptozoologist
trying to make sense of it all runs the risk of
making the false assumption that these creatures
have a basis in physical reality. Often, the leg-
ends are cited as evidence for Sm ALLHominids,
which might include anything from an un-
known race of human Pygmies to surviving aus-
tralopiths or unclassified species of apes or mon-
keys. Perhaps some folktales are based on beings
that went extinct thousands of years ago and
have become distorted, amplified, or hopelessly
entangled with other motifs.
In this category are found diminutive entities
that could represent folk memories of genuine
HOMINIDS or Primates, as well as those that
have been mentioned in the cryptozoological lit-
erature.

Lizard Man
Bipedal, reptilian ENTITY of North America.
Variant names: Jabberwok, Reptile man.
Physical description: Humanoid form. Height,
7 feet. Greenish, grayish, or brown color. Scales,
sometimes in combination with or confused
with hair. Froglike face. Glowing red eyes.
Three-fingered hands.
Behavior: Amphibious, by some accounts.
Pungent odor.
Tracks: Three-toed, clawed prints 14 inches
long, 7 inches wide, and 1 inch deep. Stride, 40
inches.
Habitat: Swamps, rivers.
Distribution: Lake Thetis, British Columbia,
Canada; Riverside, California; Dogtown, Indi-
ana; Frederick County, Maryland; Newton,
New Jersey; Cincinnati area and Mansfield,
Ohio; Scape Ore Swamp, South Carolina.
Significant sightings: At 4:00 AM. on May 25,
1955, Robert Hunnicutt saw three small fig-
ures, about 3 feet tall, kneeling by a road in
Branch Hill, Ohio. They were grayish, with
froglike faces, a bulge on the chest, and slender
arms. In July 1955, a civil defense volunteer was
driving across the Little Miami River in Love-
land, Ohio, when he briefly saw four small fig-
ures on the riverbank beneath the bridge. These
events have been classed with unidentified fly-
ing object (UFO) sightings, though no direct
connection was established.
Again in Loveland, Ohio, police officers Ray
Shockey and Mark Matthews saw a 4-foot-tall,
leathery-skinned biped with a froglike face on
Riverside Road on March 3, 1972. It jumped
over a guardrail and down an embankment to
the Little Miami River. A similar creature was
seen on March 17.
On June 29, 1988, seventeen-year-old
296 LIZARD MAN
Christopher Davis was changing a flat tire near
the Scape Ore Swamp southwest of Bishopville,
South Carolina, when he saw a green, 7-foot-
tall, scaly creature with red eyes and three fin-
gers. He jumped into his car and sped away, but
the creature leaped on top of the vehicle. The
report inspired many misidentifications and at
least one hoax over the following weeks, but
Davis stuck to his story and passed a polygraph
test in September.
Possible explanations:
(1) Except for its scaly texture and color,
Lizard man bears a certain resemblance to
Hairy Biped entities and North American
Apes.
(2) Lizard man’s alien look suggests to some
an origin connected to the ULO
phenomenon.
(3) Folklore or hoaxes based on the Gillman
character from the 1954 movie Creature
from the Black Lagoon.
(4) A surviving Coelophysis , a small, meat-
eating dinosaur that lived in New Mexico in
the Late Triassic, 210 million years ago,
suggested by Erik Beckjord. However, this
species did not resemble a humanoid
(though it was bipedal), and it had an
unmistakably long, slender, balancing tail.
(5) Chris Orrick has suggested that the
1972 case involved a misidentified Great
gray owl ( Strix nebulosa :), though southern
Ohio is outside its normal range.

LIZARDS (Unknown)
Lizards make up the Suborder Lacertilia of the
large reptilian Order Squamata, which also in-
cludes SNAKES and Amphisbaenians (Worm
lizards). In general, lizards are small- to
medium-sized scaly reptiles with four clawed
feet, elongated bodies, and tapering tails. Some
are highly arboreal, others specialize in burrow-
ing, and still others are occasionally bipedal.
There are four lizard infraorders: Gekkota, Igua-
nia, Scincomorpha, and Anguimorpha.
Infraorder Gekkota includes Geckos
(Gekkonidae and Eublepharidae) and Aus-
tralasian legless lizards (Pygopodidae) . Geckos
are known for their ability to climb up walls and
across ceilings because of the microscopic suc-
tion cups on the bristles of their toe pads. They
are widespread throughout tropical and subtrop-
ical regions of both the New and Old Worlds.
Geckos can also vocalize, and their name derives
from an Asian species with a cry that sounds like
“geck-o.” The earliest unequivocal gekkotan fos-
sil is Hoburogecko from Mongolia in the Early
Cretaceous, 105 million years ago. Most geckos
are less than 6 inches long (not including the tail,
which frequently breaks off).
Infraorder Iguania includes Iguanas (Iguan-
idae), Agamids (Agamidae), and Chameleons
(Chameleonidae). In general, they have robust
bodies, short necks, fleshy tongues, well-devel-
oped eyelids, distinct heads, and overlapping
and noniridescent scales. Many species have
well-developed ornamental crests, spines, frills,
or colorful throat fans. Some, such as the Water
dragon ( Physignathus, ), are bipedal and run rap-
idly on only two legs. Others, such as the Flying
lizards ( Draco ) of Asia, have ribs modified for
arboreal gliding. The first unequivocal iguanian
fossil is Pristiguana from South America in the
Late Cretaceous, 80 million years ago.
Infraorder Scincomorpha includes Spectacled
lizards (Gymnophthalmidae), Night lizards
(Xantusiidae), Wall lizards (Lacertidae), Whip-
tails and Tegus (Teiidae), Spinytail lizards
(Cordylidae), and True skinks (Scincidae). In
general, these animals have slim bodies, with
heads not clearly differentiated from the neck; if
the scales overlap, they are iridescent. Except for
the wall lizards, this group has a definite ten-
LIZARDS 297
dency toward limb reduction and development
of a snakelike body. The Common lizard ( Lac -
erta vivipard) of Europe exists above the Arctic
Circle; no other lizard is found that far north.
The largest animal in this group, the Prehensile-
tailed skink ( Corucia zebrata ) of the Solomon Is-
lands, is about 2 feet long and is the only true
herbivorous skink. The earliest unambiguous
scincomorph fossil is Paramacellodus from the
United Kingdom in the Middle Jurassic, 170
million years ago.
Infraorder Anguimorpha includes Glass
lizards and Alligator lizards (Anguidae), Legless
lizards (Anniellidae), Rock lizards (Xenosauri-
dae), Plated lizards (Gerrhosauridae), Blind
lizards (Dibamidae), the venomous Heloderms
(Helodermatidae), Monitors (Varanidae), and
Earless monitors (Lanthanotidae). The group
also includes a number of large, heavily armored
extinct forms — notably, the aquatic mosasaurs.
A diverse group, anguimorphs have two-part
tongues and relatively solid teeth in common.
The earliest known anguimorph is Parviraptor
from the United Kingdom in the Middle Juras-
sic, 170 million years ago.
The largest living lizard is the Komodo
dragon ( Varanus komodoensis) of Indonesia,
which averages 8 feet 6 inches in total length
and weighs 175-200 pounds. The largest accu-
rately measured Komodo was a male residing at
the St. Louis Zoological Park that was 1 0 feet 2
inches long and weighed 365 pounds in 1937.
Komodo dragons are excellent swimmers and
can run at speeds up to 15 miles per hour. The
Crocodile monitor ( Varanus salvadorii ) of
Papua New Guinea regularly grows over 12 feet
long, making it the longest lizard in the world.
One specimen was measured at 15 feet 7 inches.
Lizards can be difficult to identify in the field
without capturing a specimen, which makes it es-
pecially problematic to place lizardlike cryptids
into their respective infraorders. Larger mystery
lizards tend to be identified as monitors because
of their size and general appearance. Of the
twenty-five lizards in this list, eight (Afa,
Arteellia, Au Angi Angi, Australian Giant
Monitor, Buru, Das- Adder, Nguma-Monene,
and Venezuelan Monitor) could be monitors.
Lizards have also been proposed as candidates
for mystery CrOGODIUANS, DINOSAURS, DRAG-
ONS, Llying Reptiles, Leeshwier Monsters,
and Snakes.

wings instead of legs. Tail.
Behavior: Makes a hideous shriek. Eats sheep
and other livestock.
Habitat: Rivers.
Distribution: Wales.

Longneck
A category of Sea MONSTER identified by
Bernard Heuvelmans. It looks and behaves like
certain FRESHWATER MONSTERS in lakes and
rivers around the world.
Scientific name: Megalotaria longicollis y given
by Heuvelmans in 1965.
Variant name: Heuvelmans’s seal.
Physical description: Shape varies from serpen-
tine to thick and bunched up. Length, 15-65
feet. Dark brown on top, with black- and-gray or
whitish mottling. Underside much lighter. Skin
looks smooth when wet, but up close, it appears
wrinkled and rough. Small, round head with
two small horns. Small eyes. Tapered muzzle,
sometimes described as like a seal’s or dog’s and
at other times like a horse’s or camel’s. Long,
slender, flexible neck. A collar behind the head
is sometimes reported. There are one to three
dorsal humps, with the middle being the largest.
A slight ridge along the spine. Four webbed flip-
pers. The hind pair sometimes resembles a bilo-
bate tail.
Behavior: Amphibious. Most frequently seen
between April and October in the north, year-
round in the tropics, and from February to April
in the south. Swims with vertical undulations.
Exceptional speed, 15-35 knots. The illusion of
more than three humps may be caused by tur-
bulence waves generated by its speed. Sub-
merges vertically, as if pulled under. Does not
spout. On land, it moves by gathering its hind
legs up toward the front, then leaping forward
with the front legs in a manner similar to that of
sea lions.
Habitat: Near coasts in cold temperate re-
gions; midocean in warm temperate regions.
Distribution: Cosmopolitan, except for polar
waters. Frequently seen around the British Isles,
Newfoundland, Maine, and British Columbia
in the Northern Hemisphere; in the Tasman
Sea, off southeastern Australia, New Caledonia,
New Zealand, and Tasmania in the Southern
Hemisphere. It may also be the same animal re-
ported in many lakes in cold temperate regions
in both hemispheres.
Significant sightings: Some time before 1846,
Captain Christmas of the Danish navy encoun-
tered a long-necked animal in the North Atlantic
Ocean between Iceland and the Faroe Islands. Its
neck moved like a swan’s until it disappeared,
head foremost, like a duck diving. The part above
water seemed about 18 feet in length.
In September 1893, London physician Far-
quhar Matheson and his wife were boating in
Loch Alsh, an arm of the sea between Skye and
the Scottish mainland, when they saw a straight-
necked animal moving toward them. Its neck
was as tall as the mast of their yacht. It dived
and reappeared every two to three minutes.
On December 4, 1893, Captain R. J. Cringle
and the crew and passengers of the Natal Line
steamer Umfuli watched a long-necked Sea
monster for thirty minutes not far off the coast
of Guerguerat, Western Sahara. It was 80 feet
long and about as thick as a whale. The head
and neck together were 7-15 feet long, and the
body seemed to have three humps.
On August 5, 1919, J. Mackintosh Bell and
others fishing for cod off the south coast of Hoy
Island in the Orkney Islands of Scotland en-
countered a long-necked animal about 30 yards
from their boat. When it swam alongside the
boat at a depth of 1 0 feet, they were able to see
its full outline, with four flippers and a total
head-to-tail length of 18-20 feet. The head
looked very much like a retriever dog’s and was
LONGNECK 299
6 inches long by 4 inches wide.
Big-game hunter Tromp Van Diggelen and
other passengers on the Dunbar Castle saw an
animal with a 12-foot neck in Table Bay off
Cape Town, South Africa, in November 1930.
In 1945, Arthur Fere and others in a motor-
boat saw a strange animal sticking up above the
water in a bay off Canala, New Caledonia, in
the South Pacific. It had a big head on a black
neck marked with yellow. When the boat ap-
proached to 200 yards, the animal dived, raising
a plume of water.
Robert Duncan, a beachcomber on Bribie Is-
land, Queensland, Australia, saw a whitish-gray
monster 2 miles offshore twice in September
1962. It had a swan’s neck, a whale’s body, and
a fish’s tail and fins.
Possible explanation: An extremely elongated
form of Sea lion or Fur seal (Family Otariidae)
adapted for a purely marine existence, according
to Heuvelmans. Cladistic studies now suggest
that the true seals, sea lions, and walruses all are
most closely related to the bears, emerging from
that family 27-25 million years ago, in the Late
Oligocene. So specialized a variety most proba-
bly represents a recent evolution. Robert Cornes
speculates that it may not be related to any of
the existing seal families.

Lophenteropneust
Unknown INVERTEBRATE of the South Pacific
Ocean.
Etymology: Greek, “ridged” enteropneust.
Scientific name: Lophenteropneusta, given by
Henning Lemche.
Physical description: Length, 2-4 inches.
Cylindrical, translucent body. A ring of tenta-
cles surrounds the mouth. Terminal anus.
Tracks: Spirals and loops of fecal strings.
Habitat: Abyssal marine depths.
Distribution: Pacific Ocean.
Significant sightings: In 1962, the Scripps In-
stitute of Oceanography’s Proa Expedition in
the research vessel Spencer F. Baird took some
4,000 photos of the sea bottom in five trenches
in the western Pacific to a depth of 35,800 feet.
Several photographs showed fecal coils made by
a hemichordate of uncertain taxonomy. Similar
animals were later photographed by the Distur-
bance and Recolonization Experiment in a
Manganese Nodule Area of the Deep South Pa-
cific (DISCOL) project in the Peru Trench.
Possible explanation: The cylindrical shape is
like an Acorn worm (Class Enteropneusta),
while the ring of tentacles is characteristic of the
vase-shaped Class Pterobranchia.

Lord of the Deep
Immense sharklike FlSH of the South Pacific
Ocean.
300 LOO POO Ol’YES
A surviving Megalodon shark (Carcharodon megalodonj might explain stories of a huge Pacific shark called the Lord
OF THE DEEP ( William M. Rehsamen)
Etymology: Possibly from a Melanesian (Aus-
tronesian) word.
Physical description: Gray above and white
below or entirely pale white. Length, greater
than 30 feet, perhaps up to 100 feet or more.
Distribution: South Pacific Ocean off eastern
Australia.
Significant sightings: In 1918, fishermen in
deep water near the Broughton Islands, New
South Wales, Australia, watched as a gigantic,
“ghostly white” shark made off with their cray-
fish pots. Their estimates of the animal’s size
ranged from 115 to 300 feet long.
Novelist and fisherman Zane Grey saw a yel-
low- and-green shark, 35-40 feet long, near
Rangiroa Atoll in French Polynesia in 1927 or
1928. In 1933, he and his son saw a similar
shark, perhaps as much as 10 feet longer, in the
same area.
Possible explanations:
(1) The spotted Whale shark ( Rhincodon
typus) probably accounts for Zane Grey’s
observations.
(2) Outsize specimens of the Great white
shark ( Carcharodon carcharias) , which
averages 14-15 feet long. Individuals more
than 20 feet long exist but are extremely
rare. An unconfirmed 37-foot great white
shark was found trapped in a herring weir at
White Head Island near Grand Manan,
New Brunswick, Canada, in June 1930.
(3) A surviving Megalodon shark
( Carcharodon megalodon :), a species that was
thought to have become extinct about 1.5
million years ago, at the end of the
Pliocene. (Fossil teeth dredged up by
oceanographic expeditions have been
described as “fresh-looking” and erroneously
assumed to be fresh or subfossil.) This
ancestor or relative of the great white shark
is known to have been at least 40-50 feet
long and weighed 55 tons. Its mouth was
LORD OFTHE DEEP 301
large enough to swallow an entire cow, and
its triangular teeth were 4-6 inches long.

Lukwata
F RESHmiER Monster of East Africa.
Etymology: Ganda (Bantu) word. The prefix
lu - can mean “giant.” It is remotely possible that
the name originated from the exclamation
“Look [at] water!” spoken in imperfect English.
Variant names: Lokwata, Luquata.
Physical description: Length, 20-30 feet. Size
of a small porpoise. Dark color. Round or ovoid
head. Neck is 4 feet long.
Behavior: Aggressive. Swims with head and
neck out of the water. Moves with vertical un-
dulations. Causes whirlpools. Loud, bellowing
voice. Attempts to seize fishermen in boats or ca-
noes. Said to fight with crocodiles. Pieces of its
body are prized as charms by the local natives.
Distribution: Lake Victoria and tributary
rivers in Uganda, Tanzania, and Kenya.
Significant sightings: W. Grant, provincial
governor at Jinja, Uganda, once saw from a dis-
tance an animal swimming with its head out of
the water in the Napoleon Gulf, Lake Victoria.
Sir Clement Hill observed a large, long-
necked animal with a dark, roundish head off
Homa Mountain, Lake Victoria, Kenya, around
1900. Hill insisted it was not a crocodile.
In the 1930s, E. G. Wayland, director of the
Geological Survey of Uganda, was shown a
fragment of bone that belonged to a Lukwata.
Wayland stated he had heard the animal’s bel-
lowing roars.
In late 1959, T. E. Cox and his wife saw a
large, black animal among some reeds near the
shore of Mohoru Bay, Lake Victoria, Kenya. It
was 20-30 feet long and had a thick body with
two humps on its back, a thin neck, and a
snakelike head. It swam with vertical undula-
tions toward the center of the lake after noticing
their presence.
Possible explanations:
(1) An unknown species of large Catfish
(Family Siluridae), based on its barbels.
(2) An African rock python ( Python sebae ),
suggested by Hector Duff.
(3) A freshwater LONGNECK similar to
NESSIE, suggested by Bernard Heuvelmans
and based on the Cox sighting.

Lummis’s Pichu-Cuate
Small, deadly SNAKE of southwestern North
America.
Etymology: Pichucuate is a generic name given
in the Southwest and Mexico to snakes believed
to be venomous. It has been applied to the Can-
til ( Agkistrodon bilineatus) and Mexican lyre
snake ( Trimorphodon tau) of Mexico and the
Narrow-headed garter snake ( Thamnophis ru-
fipunctatus) in Arizona.
Physical description: As thick as a pencil. Gray
302 LUKWATA
above, rosy below. Head the size of a man’s fin-
gernail. Horns above the eyes. Tiny fangs. Ex-
tremely quick- acting, deadly venom.
Behavior: Buries itself in the sand to await prey.
Habitat: Desert.
Distribution: Mexico; Arizona; New Mexico.
Significant sightings: Charles Lummis met
with this snake on three occasions, the first in
June 1889 in Valencia County, New Mexico.
The Pueblo Indians, for whom rattlesnakes are
a familiar totem, avoid it entirely.
Present status: Possibly extinct.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Mexican horned pitviper ( Ophryacus
undulatus) has supraocular horns but is a
semiarboreal snake found only in the
mountains of southern Mexico. Its range
may have been more extensive in the past.
(2) The Black-tailed montane pitviper
(. Porthidium melanurum) also has
supraocular horns, but it has a distinctly
black tail and lateral stripes and is also
limited to Mexico.

Lusca
Giant octopus-like CEPHAIOPOD of the
Caribbean Sea.
Etymology: Bahamas Creole word.
Variant names: Giant scuttle, Him of the
Hairy Hands, Lucsa, Luska.
Physical description: Said to be half octopus
and half shark or half eel and half squid. Width,
50 feet. Phosphorescent eyes. Tentacles with
sucker tips.
Behavior: Moves with the speed of a shark.
Surfaces at night when the moon is full. Possibly
feeds on crabs and shrimp. Said to drag boats
and people into the water with its tentacles.
Habitat: Blue holes, narrow pits that plunge
as much as 200 feet straight down through rock
and coral into deep water. Some are offshore,
others are in interior lagoons.
Distribution: Andros and Grand Bahama Is-
lands in the Bahamas; Caicos Islands; off the
coast of Cuba.
Possible explanations:
(1) Gigantic Ocidpus of the kind found
washed ashore in Florida in 1896.
(2) Misidentifications of the Giant squid
{Architeuthis) , suggested by Bruce Wright.
(3) Tidal surges and vortices at the mouth
of blue holes could be mistaken for the
movement of giant tentacles.

MacFarlane’s Bear
Unknown variety of Bear of northern Canada.
Scientific name: Vetularctos inopinatus, pro-
posed by C. Hart Merriam in 1918.
Physical description: Whit ish buff t o pale yel-
lowish buff, darkening t o pale reddish brown on
the underside. Broad head. Ears set like a dog’s.
Square, long muzzle. Teeth are unlike the
brown bear’s, presenting a combination of long
canines and well-developed cusps with broadly
flattened surfaces; the cusps of the upper first
and second molars are reduced, while the lower
305
second molar lacks the posterior cusp and
notch. Wide at the shoulders. Hair on the hot -
tom of its paws. Hind claws are as big as the
front claws.
Distribution: Canadian Ar ct ic; Kodiak Island,
Alaska.
Significant sightings: The only known speci-
men was killed near Rendezvous Lake, North-
west Territories (65°52'N, 127°0LW) by Inuit
hunters on June 24, 1864. The skin and skull
were obtained by Roderick MacFarlane and
shipped t o t he Smit hsonian Inst it ut ion, wher e it
was examined by C. Hart Merriam.
In the late nineteenth century, Caspar Whit -
ney heard of a species of bear in the Canadian
North that resembled a cross between a polar
bear and a grizzly.
In 1943, Clara Helgason reminisced about an
incident many years earlier when hunters on
Kodiak Island, Alaska, shot a large, off-white
bear wit h hair on t he soles of it s paws.
Possible explanations:
(1) A Polar bear ( Ursus maritimus) x Brown
bear ( Ursus arctos) hybrid, which does occur
so met imes in t he wild.
(2) A brown bear wit h a whit ish coat .
(3) A surviving Short -faced bear ( Arctodus
simus ), an immense fossil bear and the

Madagascan Hawk Moth (Giant)
Undiscovered insect (INVERTEBRATE) of Mada-
gascar.
Scientific name: Xanthopan sp.
Physical description: Hawk moth with a 16-
inch proboscis.
Distribution: Lake It asy, Madagascar .
Possible explanation: The epiphyt ic Madagas-
can orchid Angraecum longicalcar has a rostrel-
lum about 16 inches deep that leads to its nec-
t ar -producing organs. No known local mot h has
a proboscis that long. However, entomologist
Gene Kr it sky pr edict s t hat one must exist , since
the plant manages to propagate itself.
Present status: The exist ence of a Madagascan
hawk mot h ( Xanthopan morgani praedictd) wit h
a 12-inch proboscis was predicted in 1862 by
Charles Darwin, due to the physical require-
ment for reaching the nectar in the Comet or-
chid ( Angraecum s es quip e dale). The insect was fi-
nally discovered and described in 1903.

Maeroero
WlIDMAN of New Zealand.
Etymology: Maori (Austronesian) word for a
“wild man” or a “lost tribe.”
Variant names: Macro (an occasional mis-
306 MADAGASCAN HAWK MOTH (GIANT)
spelling), Maero (North Island), Mairoero,
Ngatimamaero (South Island), Ngatimamo.
Physical description: Smaller t han a man. Cov-
er ed with long, coarse hair. Bald forehead.
Long, bony fingernails.
Behavior: Solitary. Climbs trees. Eats birds.
Said t o kidnap humans and st ab t hem wit h it s
finger s.
Habitat: Mount a ins.
Distribution: Tararua Range, North Island,
New Zealand; Fiordland National Park and the
Tautuku Forest, South Island, New Zealand.
Significant sightings: Naked, humanlike tracks
were found in 1974 near Dusky Sound and in
1993 near Lake Manapouri in the Fiordland
National Park, South Island.
Possible explanations:
(1) The arboreal Silver -gray brushtail
possum ( Trichosurus vulpeculd) was
introduced to New Zealand in 1858, but
the Maeroero tradition had been established
by 1844. This possum is only 22 inches
long at most, with a 15-inch tail.
(2) Surviving remnant s of moa-hunt ing pre-
Maori Polynesian or Melanesian aboriginals.

Magenta Whale
Unknown CETACEAN of t he Sout h Pacific and
Nor t h At lant ic Oceans.
Etymology: After the scientific research ship
Magenta.
Scientific name: Amphiptera pacifica, given by
Enrico Hillyer Giglioli in 1870.
Variant names: Mongitore’s MONSTROUS
Fish, Rhinoceros whale.
Physical description: Length, 60 feet. Gray-
green back. Lower parts are grayish-white. Muz-
zle is large and blunt . Lower jaw is slight ly longer
than the upper. Two dorsal fins, 6 feet apart .
Distribution: South Pacific and North At-
lantic Oceans; possibly the Mediterranean Sea.
Significant sightings: A two-finned baleen
whale was observed September 4, 1867, by En-
rico Hillyer Giglioli on the ship Magenta in the
South Pacific Ocean, about 1,000 miles off the
coast of Chile. The dist ance bet ween t he animal’s
two fins was about 6.6 feet, and it was grayish-
green above and grayish-white below. It had no
ridges on t he t op of it s head or on it s t hr oat .
A sea monster with two dorsal fins about 20
feet apart was seen by Alexander Taylor and the
crew of the fishing boat Lily off the coast of
Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, in Octo-
ber 1898. It spout ed like a whale and was about
68 feet long.
On July 17, 1983, a sailboat was followed by
a large animal with two dorsal fins, a trapezoidal
head, and a white belly in the Mediterranean
between Corsica and Cavalaire-sur-Mer, France.

inches long. Three pairs of legs. No joint ed, lob-
sterlike tail.
Distribution: Gander Lake and Swanger’s
Cove, Bay d’Espoir, Newfoundland.
Significant sightings: Seen at Gander Lake in
the 1930s and at Swanger’s Cove around 1932.

Mahamba
Giant CROCODILIAN of Central Africa.
Etymology: Lingala (Bantu) word.
Physical description: Length, 50 feet. Head
like a Nile crocodile’s but wider.
Behavior: Carnivorous. Said to eat humans.
Lays eggs. Digs long, underground tunnels.
Distribution: Republic of the Congo; Maika
marshes, northeast Democratic Republic of the
Congo.
Significant sighting: In 1954, Guy de la
Ruwiere saw a crocodile that was at least 23 feet
long in the Maika marshes. It lifted its large
head out of the water several times, showing an
abnormally long neck. It created a huge wave
when it dived below the surface.
Possible explanations:
(1) Large or old and aggressive specimens of
the Nile crocodile ( Crocodylus niloticus). The
official size record for this crocodile was set
in 1953 at 19 feet 6 inches, though there
are reports of larger specimens. Most rarely
grow larger than 16 feet.
(2) A surviving Deinosuchus, which lived 80
million years ago in the Late Cretaceous of
sout h Texas. Cur r ent est imat es place it s
lengt hat 33-50 feet and it s weight at 2
tons, which means it was large enough to
prey on sizable dinosaurs. Other
crocodilians of comparable size included the
caiman Purussaurus and t he gavialoid
Rhamphosuchus, both fossils from the
Miocene, 15 million years ago.

Drooping ears. Tusks like a walrus’s. Clawed
feet like an ant eat er ’s. Tuft ed t ail like a cow’s.
Behavior: Waits underwater for prey. Attacks
humans and canoes.
Habitat: Caves and hollows in the river bank.
Distribution: Maroni River, near Maripa-
soula, French Guiana.
Significant sighting: The body of a boy who
drowned in the Maroni on October 21, 1962,
was found partially eaten. The Maipolina was
blamed.
Possible explanation: An aquatic Saber-
toothed cat ( Smilodon sp.) similar to the
Yaquaru; possibly its female counterpart, sug-
gest ed by Kar 1 Shuker .

Makalala
Giant Bird of East Africa.
Etymology: Uncertain; said to mean “noisy.”
Similar to makalele (“noise”) in Lingala (Bantu).

308 MAGGOT
plat es or claws on t he wing t ips. Long legs.
Behavior: Capable of sustained, powerful
flight. Makes a loud noise when it claps its
wings t oget her . Feeds on car r ion.
Distribution: Tanzania.
Significant sighting: In Zanzibar, a Dr. Fischer
saw a birds rib that narrowed from 8 inches at
one end t o 1 inch at t he ot her . August Friedrich
graf von Marschall records that the “Wasequa”
people use Makalala skulls as ceremonial hel-
met s.
Present status: Not seen since t he ninet eent h
century.
Possible explanations:
(1) Surviving phorusrhacid bird similar to
the 6- to 9-fbot Tit anus waller i, though
these lived in North and South America and
were flightless. A Titanus toe bone found in
Texas could be as recent as 15,000 years
ago.
(2) The Secretary bird ( Sagittarius
serpentarius) inhabits much of Africa south
of t he Sahara and has adapt ed so well t o a
snake-eating life on the ground that it rarely
flies. It is one of the few bird species to have
claws on it s wing t ips. Karl Shuker suggest s
that a giant species of secretary bird might
account for the Makalala.

Makara
Myt hical Hindu Sea MONSTER.
Etymology: Sanskrit (Indo-Aryan), “neither
one t hing nor anot her ” or “myt hical beast .”
Physical description: Ridden by the god
Vishnu, t he Makara is so met imes port rayed as a
crocodile; as a dolphin, crab, or shark; or as half
fish and half elephant .
Distribution: Borobudur Temple, Java, In-
donesia.
Significant sighting: The Makara sculptures
that serve as waterspouts on the ninth-century
Buddhist t emple of Bor obudur are elephant ine,
with four unusual cheek teeth that more closely
r esemble t hose of a fossil gomphot her e t han t he
Asian elephant ( Elephas maximus).
Possible explanations:
(1) The sculptures could have been based
on fossil elephant skulls.
(2) A tetralophodon, an advanced
gomphot here that lived in India and Java in
the Pliocene, 5 million years ago, and
survived int o hist or ical t imes.
(3) The myth of the Makara may be based
in part on the Nile crocodile ( Crocodylus
niloticus) and t he Hippopot amus
( Hippopotamus amphibius).

Behavior: Tends black camels the size of don-
keys.
Distribution: Southern Chad.
Significant sighting: The comte d’Escayrac de
Laut ure heard of small, hairy, reddish men with
tails south of the Chari River in Chad.
Possible explanations:
(1) An undiscovered group of short-stat ured

Malagnira
Unknown PRIMATE of Madagascar .
Etymology: Malagasy (Aust ronesian) word,

Physical description: A lemur smaller t han t he
Gray mouse lemur {Micro ce bus murinus).
Behavior: Said to have different habits than
the mouse lemurs.
Distribution: Tsingy de Bemaraha Stria Na-
ture Reserve, west er n Madagascar .
Significant sighting: Two informants de-
scribed this animal in an early 1990s survey.
Possible explanation: The Pygmy mouse lemur
{Microcebus myoxinus) is probably the world’s
smallest living primate and has a total length of
less than 8 inches. First named in 1852, it be-
came t axonomically confused wit h ot her mouse
lemurs until 1994, when its species status was
rehabilitated by Jut t a Schmid and Peter Kap-
peler. Its presence in the Bemaraha is uncon-
firmed but possible.

fins.
Habitat: Prefers colder water under the ther-
mocline, below 160 feet .
Distribution: Pacific Ocean off Isla de
Malpelo, an island 285 miles from the coast of
Colombia.
Significant sightings: This shark has been seen
and photographed on rare occasions by divers.
Present status: Colombian biologist Sandra
Bessudo launched an investigation in March
2001 t o det er mine it s st at us.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Sand tiger shark {Car ch arias taurus)
is similar and found in all warm seas except
perhaps the eastern Pacific. It grows to a
length of about 10 feet 6 inches. However,
its dorsal fin is placed farther back.
(2) The Smallt oot h sand t iger ( Odontaspis
ferox) has been seen off southern California
and Baja California. It has smaller eyes and
grows to 12 feet long.
(3) An unknown species of Sand tiger shark
(Family Odont aspididae), suggested by

nese/Sino-Tibetan, “self-concealing rat”).
Physical description: Large as an elephant.
Grayish-red hair. Tiny eyes. Tusks. Short tail.
Behavior: Lives underground. Digs t unnels in
t he snow. It s wanderings are said t o cause ear t h-
quakes.
310 MALAGNIRA
The Woolly mammoth fMammuthus primigeniusy). (© 2002 ArtToday.com, Inc., an IMSI Company)
Tracks: Oval. Width, 2 feet. Length, 18
inches. Spaced 12 feet apart.
Habitat: Pine and birch forests, tundra.
Distribution: Siberia; Mongolia; China.
Significant sightings: In 1581, the Cossack
leader Yermak Timofeyevich reported meeting
up wit h a hairy elephant east of t he Ural Moun-
tains.
A Russian hunter came across enormous
tracks in a forested region near the Obskaya
Gulf, Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Province,
Siberia, in 1918. The print s were 24 inches long
and 18 inches wide, with a stride of 12 feet . He
found large droppings consisting of vegetable
matter and noticed tree branches at a height of
9-10 feet that were apparently damaged by the
animal’s passing. After several days of tracking,
he sighted two huge elephants with white,
curved tusks and dark-chestnut hair that was
longer on the flanks and shorter in front .
Possible explanation: A myth based on the
subfossil remains of the Woolly mammoth
(. Mammuthus primigenius ), an elephant that
lived in Eur ope, Asia, and Nor t h Amer ica at the
end of the last Ice Age. It was covered with
thick, spiral locks of black or dark-brown guard
hairs above shorter, silkier under wool. With a
shoulder height of 9-12 feet , it s weight has been
est imat ed at 4—7 t ons. Bot h males and females
had t usks.
Rumors of mammot h survival seem primarily
to be based upon subfossil specimens
40,000-10,000 years old found frozen in the
permafrost, with muscles, skin, and hair intact.
Carcasses found in defrosting peat by Siberian
nomads may have been interpreted as contem-
poraneous fauna that lived underground. The
observations of 1581 and 1918 are isolated and
not strong evidence of the animal’s persistence
int o hist or ical t imes.
The most famous finds of frozen mammoths
in the Siberian permafrost are: the Adams or
Lena mammoth, discovered in 1799 in the Lena
River delta, Sakha Republic (35,000 years old);
the Berezovka mammoth, found in 1900 along
the Berezovka River, Sakha Republic
(40,000-30,000 years old); the Taymyr mam-
moth, recovered in 1949 (13,000 years old); the
Dima mammoth, a complete carcass of a 6- to
12-month-old baby discovered in 1979 on the
MAMANTU 311
Kirgilyakh River, Magadan Region (40, GOO-
26. 000 years old); a mummified baby mam-
moth, less than three months old, found in
1988; and the Jarkov mammoth, discovered in
1997 near the Bolchaya Balakhnya River,
Taymyr Autonomous Province, and excavated
nearly intact in 1999 by Bernard Buigues
(20,000 years old). The Heilongjiang Province
of China contains dozens of mammoth finds.
In the Crimea and the Caucasus, mammoths
became extinct about 30,000-20,000 years ago;
on the Russian plain, they were still present about
13.000 years ago. Based on radiocarbon dating,
the latest mammoth remains found in Western
Europe (northern France, Switzerland, and Great
Britain) also date to 13,000-12,000 years ago.
Radiocarbon dating of teeth, tusks, and bones
of dwarf mammoths found on Wrangel Island,
Chukot Autonomous Province, between 1989
and 1991 proved that some mammoths survived
into historical times, until about 2,000 B.G With
a shoulder height of only 6 feet and weighing
only 4,400 pounds, these isolated animals consti-
tute a distinct subspecies (M. p. vrangeliensis ) .

Mamba Mutu
MERBEING of Central Africa.
Etymology: From the Swahili (Bantu) mamba
mtu (“crocodile man”).
Variant name: Mamba muntu.
Physical description: Half human, half fish.
Behavior: Sucks human blood and eats brains.
Distribution: Lake Tanganyika and Lukuga
River, Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Possible explanations:
(1) Isolated population of the West African
manatee ( Trichechus senegalensis) , though
these animals are herbivorous.
(2) An unknown species of giant otter with
a flat skull, suggested by zoologist Carlos
Bonet.

312 MAMBA MUTU
Mami Water
Meebeing of West Africa.
Variant names: Mami wata, Tahbin, Tahbi-
yin (for the female).
Physical description: Fair-skinned female water
spirit.
Behavior: Represents eroticism.
Habitat: Rivers.
Distribution: Ghana; Niger River delta in
Nigeria.
Possible explanations:
(1) The West African manatee ( Trichechus
senegalensis ) is 7-12 feet long and found in
coastal waters and rivers from Senegal to
Angola. It feeds primarily at night, making
chance observations mysterious.
(2) The oldest known Mami water wooden
carvings date from about 1901 in riverine
areas of southern Nigeria. There is artistic
evidence that they derive from Der
Schlangenbandinger (The Snake Charmer), a
circa 1880-1887 chromolithograph of the
exotic, long-haired, snake-charming wife of
a Hamburg zookeeper. Copies of this
popular print that were sold in West Africa
in the mid- to late 1950s originated in

Mamlambo
Freshwater MoNSTERof South Africa.
Etymology: From the Xhosa (Bantu) umam-
lambo , the name for a mythical river goddess or
MEEBEING who brings riches and whose true
form is a snake.
Physical description: Length, 66 feet. Head is
like a snake’s or horse’s. Eyes glow green at
night. Crocodilian body. Short, stumpy legs.

Significant sighting: Eyewitnesses reported a
“half-fish, half-horse” monster in the Mzintlava
River that was held responsible for nine deaths
in the first months of 1997.
Possible explanations:

sembled brown leather and seemed to lack
feathers.
Possible explanations:
(1) A large stork native to Brazil, either the
Jabiru {Jabiru mycteria :), the Maguari
( Ciconia maguari), or the Wood stork
(. Mycteria americana).

Significant sightings: In 1797, frontiersman
Peter Pentz killed a big cat with a matted, yel-
low-brown mane in a cave on Bald Eagle Moun-
tain, Pennsylvania. It had been killing local live-
stock for six years.
Hunter Archie McMath shot and killed a yel-
lowish, lionlike animal in Lake County, Califor-
nia, in 1868. It had a total length of 1 1 feet and
weighed more than 30 pounds. The front part
was stockier than its hindquarters, and it had
black stripes along its shoulders and back and
down its fore parts. Its hair was darker and
thicker around its neck.
A maned cat was seen in conjunction with a
black panther around Elkhorn Falls, Indiana,
from August 5 to 8, 1948. The pair apparently
migrated east into Ohio by early September.
Around August 1, 1954, farmer Arnold Neu-
jahr saw what looked like an African lion 2 miles
west of Surprise, Nebraska. Similar incidents
took place closer to town and near Rising City.
Residents recalled other lion sightings around
314 MAN-BEAST OF DARIEN
Ceresco in November 1951 that sparked a lion
hunt.
Near Kapuskasing, Ontario, in June 1960,
Leo Paul Dallaire watched an animal resembling
an African lion on his farm. It was light tan and
had a mane and a 4-foot tail with a bushy tip.
On the evening of November 10, 1979, sev-
eral residents of Fremont, California, reported
that a large, male lion was on the loose in the
Coyote Hills Regional Park. Police Officer
William Fontes saw it in the Alameda County
flood channel, and he estimated its weight as
300-400 pounds.
On July 30, 1986, Cindy Belmont and her
brother saw a long-tailed, beige “tiger” near
Jackson, Pennsylvania. It was accompanied by a
shaggy animal that looked like a collie dog.
Several reports of a 7-foot-long, maned cat
were phoned in to the Mentor, Ohio, police in
June 1992. Although witnesses insisted it
looked like a male lion, the police decided a
large golden retriever dog was responsible.
On June 5, 1996, Belen Grabb was driving
on Canyon Drive near Spokane, Washington,
when a lion strolled off an adjacent golf course
and into the road in front of her. She stopped
her car 4 feet away from it. It was dark beige
with a brown mane. The sighting sparked two
days of intense searching for the animal.
Possible explanations:
(1) An African lion ( Panthera leo) escaped
from a zoo, circus, or exotic pet owner.
Escapes do occur, and some may not be
reported by private owners.
(2) The Domestic dog ( Canis familiaris) is
rarely a look-alike for a large, maned cat.
However, Karl Shuker points out that both
a chow chow and a Brittany spaniel have
been put forward as candidates by
authorities desperate for an explanation. A
Newfoundland is a better match, although
it looks more like a bear cub.
(3) A surviving American lion (. Panthera
atrox ), a powerful Pleistocene predator with
large canine teeth that died out about 9,000
years ago, has been suggested by Mark A.
Hall and Loren Coleman. Fossils of this
animal have been found from Alaska to
Peru, but the richest source are the tar pits
at Rancho La Brea, California. Males were
about 25 percent larger than the African
lion, with blunter faces and longer legs. The
molar teeth indicate sexual dimorphism,
leading Hall and Coleman to speculate that
the female P. atrox might account for
reports of a melanistic EASTERN PUMA. Such
an extreme difference between the sexes is
difficult to accept without further proof.
(However, having two species of large,
unknown felids occupying basically the
same habitat in North America is at least
equally unlikely.) Presumably, this species
traveled in prides, but Maned American
lions seem to travel in pairs.

Mangiacopra.
Physical description: Serpentine or eel-like.
Length, 15-50 feet. Horselike or snakelike flat
head, 3 feet long, tapering down to the muzzle.
Enormous eyes. Slender neck, 10 feet long or
more. A mane or beard has been reported.

MANER 315
circle a boat, jump completely out of the water,
and land on its stomach.
Distribution: North Atlantic Ocean along the
coast of the United States.
Significant sightings: On September 25, 1888,
Captain Springs of the tug Henry Buck was tow-
ing a schooner in Winyah Bay, near George-
town, South Carolina, when he spotted a 50-
foot animal swimming on the surface with its
head 3 feet in the air. The head was vermilion,
and the neck was covered with a long mane.
The captain’s story was corroborated by others.
Pilot Alexander Banta watched a black crea-
ture larger than a whale as he was off City Is-
land, New York, on August 10, 1902. It dived,
came up under the boat, and struck it so that it
nearly capsized. The monster had enormous
eyes and a yellow mane.
Present status: Similar to Bernard Heuvel-
mans’s MERHORSE.
Possible explanation: An unknown mammal,
perhaps related to the Seals (Suborder Pinni-
pedia).

Mangarsahoc
Mystery HOOFED M AM M AL of Madagascar.
Etymology: Malagasy (Austronesian), “beast
whose ears hide its chin.”
Variant names: Mangarisoaka, Tokatongotra.
Physical description: Donkeylike animal. Long
ears. Round hoof like a horse’s.
Behavior: Brays like a donkey.
Tracks: Hoofed.
Habitat: Rainforest.
Distribution: Ankaizina Mountains; Beala-
nana and Manirenja Districts in the north-cen-
tral highlands; north of Tolagnaro in southeast-
ern Madagascar.
Possible explanations:
(1) Surviving Malagasy pygmy
hippopotamuses ( Hippopotamus lemerlei and
H. madagascariensis) that supposedly died
off within the past 1,000 years or so. See
Tsy- Aom b y- Aqm b y.

Physical description: Antlers are distinct from
those of other deer species.
Distribution: Pu Mat Reserve, Vietnam.
Significant sighting: In the 1990s, zoologist
John MacKinnon found a pair of odd antlers in
a box of specimens collected from Pu Mat as
long ago as the late 1960s.

spike.
Behavior: Said to pull dogs and humans
underwater.
316 MANETUWI MSI-PISSI
Distribution: Rio Paraguay drainage; swamps
of the Gran Chaco, Boqueron Department,
Paraguay.
Possible explanations:
(1) Toothless, freshwater shark, according
to Percy Fawcett. However, the only
known shark to stay for extended periods
in freshwater, the aggressive Bull shark
( Carcharhinus leucas) of the Amazon
and elsewhere, has triangular, serrated
teeth.
(2) Giant Catfish (Suborder Siluroidea),
said to grow to 1 8 feet in length and weigh
half a ton. Older specimens of catfish
sometimes are toothless.
(3) A large sturgeon, according to Mike
Grayson, though none occur anywhere in
the Southern Hemisphere.

Manipogo
Freshwater Monster of Manitoba, Canada.
Etymology: Named by Tom Locke in 1960, in
imitation of OGOPOGO.
Variant name: Manny.
Physical description: Serpentine. Length,
10-40 feet. Brownish-black upper body. At
least one hump. Flat, diamond-shaped head.
Behavior: Bellows like a train whistle.
Distribution: Lake Manitoba, Manitoba. The
animal’s name is also used as a synonym for
WlNNIPOGO in other Manitoban lakes.
Significant sightings : Louis Betecher and
Eddie Nipanik saw a serpentine animal in the
lake in 1957.
On August 10, 1960, government land in-
spector Tom Locke and sixteen other witnesses
saw three creatures swimming offshore near Ma-
nipogo Beach. They looked like huge, dark-
brown snakes. Many other sightings were re-
ported that summer. Zoologist James A.
McLeod led an expedition to Lake Manitoba
later in the year and interviewed many residents.
Richard Vincent and John Konefall saw a
“large black snake or eel” off Meadow Portage
on August 12, 1962. Vincent took three photos,
one of which shows an elongated, snakelike ob-
ject with a hump. Unfortunately, some incon-
sistencies have undermined the credibility of
this case.
In the summer of 1987, Allen McLean and
his family were boating in Portage Bay when
they saw a large, black object swimming toward
them.

Man-Monkey
WlLDMAN of central England.
Physical description: Black creature. Large,
white eyes.
Behavior: Rides horses.
Distribution: Woodseaves, Staffordshire, En-
gland.
Significant sighting: On January 21, 1879, on
the highroad over the Birmingham and Liver-
pool Canal between Ranton and Woodcote, 1
mile from the village of Woodseaves, a strange
creature jumped on the back of a man’s cart-
horse and rode it into a canter. The man’s ap-
plication of his whip had no effect on it.

male).
Distribution: Ohio.

Manticora
SEMIMYTHICAL BEAST of West Asia and the In-
dian subcontinent.
Etymology: Old Persian, “man-eater,” from
martiya (“man”) + khvar (“to eat”). A corrupt
reading of Aristotle turned the Greek variant
martikhora to manticora.
Variant names: Manticore, Man-tiger, Marti-
khora (Greek).
Physical description: Size of a lion. Red color.
Head is like a man’s. Gray or blue eyes. Large
ears. Three rows of teeth in each jaw. Stingers
on a pointed, scorpion-like, 1 8-inch tail.
Behavior: Sting from tail is said to be fatal.
Can shoot foot-long spines in its tail a distance
of 100 feet. Hunted by locals mounted on ele-
phants.
Distribution: India; Iran.
Possible explanations:
(1) According to Valentine Ball, the Tiger
{Panther a tigris) has a small, clawlike dermal
structure at the end of its tail. Its whiskers
can also cause lacerations. The three rows of
teeth might refer to the tiger’s trilobate
molars. Tigers were hunted in ancient times
by local princes who rode elephants. Man-
eating tigers are feared by villagers in India.
A tiger wounded by porcupine quills may
prevent it from taking its usual prey and
force it to become a man-eater. Distorted
accounts of the Caspian Tger(P. t. virgata)
could be another source of information.
(2) The Indian crested porcupine ( Hystrix
indica) may have confused early travelers
because it wounds tigers and leopards with
its quills. However, it does not shoot them
from a distance.
(3) The Slender loris ( Loris tardigradus) of
southern India may have contributed the
tradition of a human face.

Mapinguari
Mystery PRIMATE or SLOTH of South America.
Variant names: Cape-lobo (“wolfs cape”),
Juma, Mao de pilao (“pestle hand”), Mapin-
guary, Ow-ow, Pe DE G ARRAFA
Physical description: Height, about 5-6 feet
when standing upright. Weighs about 500
pounds. Long, reddish fur or hair. Monkeylike
face. Manelike hair along its back. Said to have
another mouth in its belly. Its feet are said to
turn backward.
Behavior: Nocturnal. Avoids water. Descends
from the mountains in the autumn. Cry is ei-
ther a deafening roar or like a human shout. Re-
leases a foul-smelling stench when threatened.
Kills cattle by pulling out their tongues. Eats ba-
caba palm hearts and berries. Twists palm trees
318 MANTICORA
to the ground to get the palm hearts. Travels
with herds of White-lipped peccaries ( Tayassu
pecan). Said to be followed by an army of bee-
tles. Cannot be wounded by weapons except
around its navel.
Tracks: Either humanlike or like the bottom
of a bottle stuck into the ground. Length,
11-21 inches. Stride, 3-4 feet. Feces similar to
a horse’s.
Distribution: The apelike variety is more
often seen in Mato Grosso and Para States,
Brazil; the slothlike variety has been reported in
Amazonas and Acre States, Brazil. Possible evi-
dence also exists in Paraguay.
Significant sightings: An adventurer named
Inocencio was with ten friends on an expedition
up the Rio Uatuma, Para State, Brazil, in 1930
when he was separated from them and got lost.
As he slept in a tree for the night, he heard loud
cries coming from a thickset, black figure that
stood upright like a man. He shot at it several
times and apparently hit it, as there was a trail of
blood below his tree.
In 1975, mine worker Mario Pereira de Souza
claims he encountered a Mapinguari at a mining
camp along the Rio Jamauchim south of
Itaituba, Para State, Brazil. He heard a scream
and saw the creature coming toward him on its
hind legs. It seemed unsteady and emitted a ter-
rible stench.
In the 1980s and 1990s, David Oren con-
ducted fifty interviews with Brazilian Indians,
rubber planters, and miners who know about
the animal. He interviewed seven hunters who
claim to have shot specimens. One group of
Kanamari Indians living in the Rio Jurua Valley
claimed to have raised two infant Mapinguaris
on bananas and milk; after one or two years, the
creatures’ stench became unbearable, and they
were released.
In the late 1990s, Dutch zoologist Marc van
Roosmalen heard that people in one village
along the Rio Purus, Amazonas State, Brazil,
moved their homes across the river after Mapin-
guari tracks were found nearby.
Possible explanations:
(1) Unknown ape similar to De Loys’s Ape
or the DlDI.
(2) A surviving man-sized Patagonian cave-
dwelling sloth of the genus Mylodon. All
subfossil fur samples are red. Mylodon
walked with its clawed feet curved toward
the center of its body. Its dermal ossicles
(except around the navel) might protect it
from gunfire. The round tracks might be
the impression of the heavy tail tip as the
creature stands upright. David Oren
suggests that the “second mouth” is a
specialized, scent-secreting gland.

of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans.
Significant sightings: Capt. George Hope of
the HMS Fly observed a huge, alligator-like an-
imal with a long neck swimming underwater in
the Gulf of California in the late 1830s.
A controversial sighting occurred January 13,
1852, in the South Pacific Ocean about 700
miles northeast of the lies Marquises. Capt.
Charles (or Jason) Seabury, of the New Bedford
whaler Monongahela, , claimed to have har-
pooned and killed a reptilian monster 103 feet
long with a 10-foot-long, alligator-like head.
Seabury had the animal’s head cut off and man-
aged to preserve some bones, an eye, and the
heart. However, after sending back a report on
the encounter via another ship (variously identi-
fied as the brig Gipsy or the Rebecca Sims), the
Monongahela was apparently lost at sea.
On July 30, 1877, Capt. W. H. Nelson and
officers of the Sacramento sighted a sea monster
in the mid-North Atlantic. It had a flat head
raised several feet above the surface, was yellow-
ish or reddish-brown in color, and appeared to
be 40-60 feet long.
A crocodile-shaped, 60-foot-long sea monster
was allegedly thrown into the air by an under-
water explosion after the German submarine U-
28 torpedoed the British steamer Iberian off
County Cork, Ireland, on July 30, 1915. Some
discrepancies in the account given by the U-
boat commander eighteen years later cast some
doubt on the incident.
Possible explanations:
(1) The long beak of the Garpike ( Belone
belone) is slightly reptilian, but this fish has
a maximum length of only 3 feet.
(2) A surviving thalattosuchian, a group of
long-snouted crocodilians known mostly
from European marine sediments of the
Early Jurassic to the Early Cretaceous,
190-100 million years ago. Their elongated
jaws made it easy for them to catch and eat
fish, probably by ambush rather than
pursuit. It is now thought, however, that
they swam with vertical undulations like
whales. There were two types: the
teleosaurs, which had webbed feet, dermal
armor, and a tapered tail, and the
metriorhynchids, which had flippers, no
armor, and possibly a tail fin. They
appeared to favor open water.
(3) A surviving mosasaur, a group of twenty
genera related to monitor lizards that
included some of the largest marine reptiles
ever, frequently exceeding 33 feet in length.
They lived in the Late Cretaceous, 95-65
million years ago, and had large, conical
teeth, each set in a deep socket. There is
reasonable evidence to indicate that
320 MARINE SAURIAN
mosasaurs swam upstream to breed in
freshwater rivers and lakes, thus preferring
coastal waters.
(4) A surviving pliosaur, a group of short-
necked plesiosaurs with large heads,
elongated jaws with massive teeth, two sets
of flippers, and pointed tails. In some larger
species, such as Kronosaurus queenslandicus
(over 40 feet), the skull was 10 feet long.
The animals lived 200-65 million years ago,
from the Early Jurassic to the end of the
Cretaceous; they swam underwater
aero dynamically like penguins and were
probably pursuit predators.

MARSUPIALS (Unknown)
The young of most Marsupials (Infraclass
Metatheria) are born extremely undeveloped
compared to other mammals; after birth, they
fasten themselves more or less permanently to
teats in the mother’s brood pouch. The epipu-
bic bones that support this pouch, along with a
specific dentition of four molars and five inci-
sors in the upper jaw, are diagnostic traits of this
diverse group. Some of the better-known mar-
supials are the American opossums, the Aus-
tralian kangaroos and wallabies, the THYLACINE,
TASMANIAN Devit bandicoots, koalas, wom-
bats, and possums.
The earliest marsupial fossils date from the
Early Cretaceous, 110 million years ago, in
North America. From there, they quickly spread
to South America in one direction and Europe
and Africa in another (where they eventually
died out). The South American groups differen-
tiated and radiated into Antarctica, where they
diversified further, spreading to Australia by the
Early Oligocene, 30 million years ago, when it
became isolated from the other southern land-
masses. All of the 282 living species are endemic
to Australia and New Guinea or South America,
MARSUPIALS 321
with the sole exception of the Virginia opossum
(. Didelphis virginiand) of North America, a rela-
tive newcomer in the Pleistocene.
Marsupials achieved their greatest diversity in
Australia, where they faced no competition
from eutherian (nonmarsupial) mammals. The
largest was the extinct, hippopotamus-sized
Diprotodon optatum , which may have lingered
long enough for the earliest Australians to prey
on them 18,000-6,000 years ago. Other oddi-
ties were the horse-sized, huge-clawed Palor-
chestes , another Pleistocene survivor; Thylacoleo,
the marsupial equivalent of a lion, which had
saber-tooth incisors, huge molars, and clawed
thumbs; a giant wombat, Phascolonus; and the
sthenurine kangaroos, which may have looked
like giant rabbits.
Of the eleven cryptids in this section, only
one is South American (the MACAS Mammai);
the PHANTOM KANGAKX) is an out-of-place vis-
itor reported with some frequency in North
America and Europe; the others are from Aus-
tralia or New Guinea and may represent sur-
vivals of supposedly extinct species or folk mem-
ories of them. A marsupial origin for the
AUSTRALIAN Big Cat has also been suggested,
but this animal looks too much like a real cat to
argue otherwise with any confidence.

Mbielu-Mbielu-Mbielu
Unknown DlNOSAUR-like animal of Central
Africa.
Etymology: Possibly Lingala (Bantu).
Physical description: Has large “planks” grow-
ing out of its back, which is covered with green,
algal growth.
Behavior: Almost always seen in water with its
back protruding. Active in the late afternoon.
Distribution: Likouala River, Republic of the
Congo.
Significant sightings: A Mbielu-mbielu-mbielu
was seen near Epena at a place called Ikekesse.
Green vegetable growth was visible on its back
as it came out of the water.
Odette Gesonget, a woman of Bouanila, Re-
public of the Congo, selected a picture of a
Stegosaurus from books provided by Roy Mackal
in 1980 as an animal that her parents had told
her about.
Possible explanation: A surviving stegosaur, a
group of dinosaurs best known from the Late
Jurassic, 150 million years ago, suggested by
Roy Mackal. An African fossil genus, the 20-
foot Kentrosaurus, has been found in abundance
in the Tendaguru beds of Tanzania and had six
pairs of erect plates along the neck and upper
back, followed by three pairs of fiat spines and
five pairs of large spines on the tail.

MBIELU-MBIELU-MBIELU 323
Mecheny
GlANTHOMINID of western Siberia.
Etymology: Mansi (Ob-Ugric) nickname for
an individual, meaning “marked” and referring
to its white forearm.
Variant name: Kompolen.
Physical description: Height, 6-7 feet. Cov-
ered in 2-inch, red-brown hair. Round head.
Prominent browridges. Shorter hair covers the
face, including the ears and nose. Glowing red
eyes. No neck. Shoulders are wide and muscu-
lar. Powerful, barrellike chest. Left forearm is
white. Large, scoop-shaped hands. Reddish skin
on palms. Hair is longer in the groin. Enormous
feet are covered with hair.
Behavior: Seen most frequently in August.
Apparently follows a seasonal migratory path.
Call is “khe!” like clearing the throat. Knocks on
windows to announce its presence. Dislikes
dogs.
Distribution: Tyumen’ Region, western Si-
beria, Russia.
Significant sightings: Researcher Maya Bykova
twice observed Mecheny outside a remote hunt-
ing cabin. She had traveled to the area after
meeting a young Mansi man whose family had
regularly encountered a large wildman near
their hunting lodge since the 1940s. In the first
encounter on August 16, 1987, Mecheny
knocked on the cabin window at early dawn.
Bykova and the family rushed outside and saw a
figure more than 6 feet tall leaning against a
dead tree. After about a minute of looking back
at Bykova, Mecheny departed when the dog
came out barking. In mid-October 1987, the
dog disappeared and was found the next morn-
ing, its skull crushed and body ripped apart.
Bykova’s second encounter took place outside
the cabin on the night of August 22, 1988,
when she and the Mansi hunter watched
Mecheny for seventy-five minutes in the woods,
where it was apparently looking for frogs or
mice. The next morning, they found trampled
grass and narrow trails where the creature had
walked.

Mediterranean Giant Snake
Large SNAKE of Southern Europe.
Variant name: COLOVIA.
Physical description: Length, 6-33 feet. Green.
Distribution: Southern Spain; southern
France; northern and central Italy; Greece;
Serbia.
Significant sightings: On July 22, 1969, a 7-
foot, green snake caused a traffic accident when
it crossed a road near Chinchilla de Monte
Aragon, Albicete Province, Spain.
A 6-foot snake with a huge head was seen sev-
eral times on a farm in Orihuela, Alicante
Province, Spain, in June 1970.
A monstrous serpent with a mane and a head
like a baby’s was seen in July 1973 near
Aceuche, Caceres Province, Spain.
Snakes up to 33 feet long have been seen on
Ovcar Mountain near Cacak, Serbia. Near Ivan-
jica in the summer of 2000, a bus had to stop
because a 33-foot snake was crossing the road.
Possible explanation: Stray specimens of the
poisonous Montpellier snake (. Malpolon mon-
spessulanus ), a gray, brownish, or olive-colored
colubrid snake that can attain a length of 9 feet.
It lives along the coasts of Spain, southern
France, and Liguria in Italy; in North Africa
from Morocco to Tunisia; and in Cyprus,
Greece, and the Balkans. However, it may be
expanding its range.

Memphre
Freshwater Monster of Quebec, Canada.
Etymology: After Lake Memphremagog.
Coined in 1987 by Jacques Boisvert, an insur-
ance broker of Magog, Quebec.
Physical description: Serpentine. Length,
25-50 feet. Dark color. Smooth skin. Cow- or

In 1854, Henry Wadleigh saw an animal as
large as a log that held its head 2 feet above the
water.
In the summer of 1976, a black, seallike ani-
mal with a long neck was seen near Fitchbay.
On August 12, 1983, Barbara Malloy
snapped a photo of a huge, black hump as she
was boating on the lake with her family.
Mayor Denis Lacasse, of Magog, Quebec,
was skeptical until he saw Memphre on June 19,
1996, near Cummins Bay.

Mene Mamma
Fish-tailed MEEBEING of South America.
Etymology: Quechuan or possibly Creole,
“mother of waters.”
Variant names: Femme poisson (in Mar-
tinique), Mae do rio, Mayuj-mamma, Orehu
(Arawakan).
Physical description: Half woman, half fish.
Behavior: Sometimes drags canoes underwater.
Distribution: Guyana; the Caribbean; Brazil;
Argentina.
Significant sighting: In 1793, Gov. A. I. van
Imbyse van Battenburg of Berbice (now
Guyana) told the British doctor Colin
Chisholm of the half-women, half-fish seen in
the rivers of his country. The creatures were
generally observed in a sitting posture in the
water; when disturbed, they swam away, creat-
ing a disturbance with their tails.
Possible explanation: Van Battenberg’s ani-
mals are almost certainly the West Indian man-
atee ( Trichechus manatus) , often seen at the
mouths of Guyanese rivers.

Menehune
Li TEE People of Oceania.
Etymology: Hawaiian (Austronesian), “to get
together to work and complete a task.” The
older Polynesian term Manahuna was used by
Society Islanders and others to denote a specific
class of people in their hierarchical system. The
Manahuna were the lowest class, or common
people.
Variant names: Manahuna, Nawao, People of
Mu.
Physical description: Height, 2-3 feet. Nawao
and Mu people are said to be taller. Hairy. Stout
and muscular. Red or dark skin. Protruding
forehead. Big eyes. Long eyebrows. Short, thick
nose. Sharp ears. Small mouth. Broad shoulders.
Round belly.
Behavior: Nocturnal. Has a deep voice. Nor-
mal language is telepathic, expressed with whis-
pers or growls. Said to be able to learn English.
Eats bananas, fish, shrimp, milk, squash, berries,
sugarcane, and sweet potatoes. Lives in caves,
lava tubes, hollow logs, or banana-leaf huts.
Usually well dressed. Works at night to build
fishponds, stoneworks, irrigation ditches,
houses, and monuments. Carves petroglyphs.
Enjoys playing games, music, dancing, singing,
diving, and sports. Afraid of owls and dogs.
Learned how to cook from humans.
Habitat: Mountain forests.
Distribution: Hawaiian Islands, especially on
Kauai.
Significant sightings: In the late eighteenth
century, a census of the island of Kauai by King
Kaumualii counted sixty- five Menehune in the
Wainiha Valley.
About forty-five elementary-school children
and their school superintendent saw a group of
Menehune jumping up and down among some
trees on the Waimea Parish property in the
1940s. When they sensed they were being
watched, the Menehune apparently disappeared
into a secret tunnel near the parish house.
Possible explanation: A second wave of colo-
nizing Polynesians around A.D. 1100-1300
found that those in the first wave, who had ar-
rived in A.D. 500-800, were already established
in Hawaii. These earlier individuals may have
been treated as a common, or Manahuna, social
class. Over time, as the two waves of colonists
intermingled, the name may have become a ref-
erence to a mythical race of Little people some-
how connected to ancient times.

MERBEINGS
Mermaids, mermen, merbeings, or merfolk en-
compass a wide variety of aquatic creatures that
either are at least partially human in appearance
or take human form at certain times. Some are
ultimately based on the fish-tailed gods, god-
desses, and entities represented in the mytholo-
gies of many cultures, including Mesopotamia,
Japan, China, India, and Greece. Some of the
earliest god- myths, such as the Babylonian Ea
and the Phoenician DERKETO, percolated
through oral history via cultural dispersion and
intermingled with European legends about the
sea and streams; they took on regional lore
about seals and other aquatic animals and ulti-
mately contributed to tales of the SEIKIES and
RUSALKAS of European tradition. North Ameri-
can and African varieties were either imported
from Europe and Asia or developed locally.
It makes sense for any maritime or riverine
culture to have an amphibious deity for all sorts
of reasons — to assure good weather, safe trips,
and successful fishing or to serve as a scapegoat
for bad luck — whether there is a zoological
model for a fish-tailed human or not. Nonethe-
less, as the most human-looking of sea creatures,
SEALS and Sirenians have undoubtedly influ-
enced merfolk-lore for centuries. Both mam-
mals can appear to rest vertically in the water in
the posture of a classic MERMAID. Female man-
atees and dugongs have mammary glands lo-
cated in the axilla, or armpit, with which they
nurse their calves as they graze or move about,
though this activity is relatively brief. The seal’s
fishy shape, smooth coat, expressive eyes, vocal-
izations, and fondness for basking are all ele-
ments that could foster a Merm AID myth.
However, scattered throughout history are
seemingly reliable descriptions of unknown
aquatic animals with a peculiar resemblance to
human beings. These accounts (primarily found
in the Merm AID entry) indicate an unknown va-
riety of seal with light fur, oddly flexible front
flippers, and a long mane. It is this seeming nat-
uralism that has kept Merbeings from falling
into the red-eyed, apparitional class of high-
strangeness ENTITIES that keep one foot (or flip-
per) in a paraphysical realm. If these observa-
tions represent a real species that became extinct
in recent times, then a physical archetype for
half-man/half-fish myths worldwide could some
day emerge from the fossil record.
Of the twenty-nine Merbeings listed here,
eleven have European origins, five are Asian or
Middle Eastern, two are African, six are North
American, three are South American, one is
Australasian, and one (JENNY HANIVER) is a
generic name for Merbeing fakes. (Loren Cole-
man and Patrick Huyghe are more inclusive in
their Merbeing category, adding in an assorted
lot of web-footed ENTITIES such as Chu-
P ACABRAS and some HAIRY BIPEDS.)

Merhorse
A category of Sea MONSTER identified by
Bernard Heuvelmans.
Scientific name : Halshippus olaimagni , given
by Heuvelmans in 1965.
Variant names: Hippokampos, MANER
Physical description: Elongated, with smooth,
shiny skin. Length, 15—100 feet, though rarely
exceeding 60 feet. Dark-brown or steel-gray to
black in northern regions; mahogany in warmer
regions. Skin is smooth and shiny, possibly with
short fur. Wide, flat, diamond-shaped head, de-
scribed as similar to that of a horse, camel,
snake, or hog. Head, 3 feet long. Wide mouth,
perhaps edged with light-colored lips. Has
whiskery bristles like a mustache. Enormous,
forward-pointing, black eyes. Slender neck, 10
feet long or more. Often, a long, flowing, red-
dish mane hangs down its neck. Jagged crest on
the back. Pair of frontal flippers. Possibly a hind
pair of flippers that form a false tail; alterna-
tively, a fanlike tail.
Behavior: Swims with pronounced vertical
undulations. Rapid speed. Hisses. Feeds on
fishes and possibly giant squid.
Habitat: Semiabyssal depths of 50-100 fath-
oms in the daytime, coming to the surface at
night. Frequents coastal areas in temperate re-
gions and moves further out on the continental
shelf in warmer zones.
Distribution: Nearly cosmopolitan, except for
polar seas and the Indian Ocean. At various
times, it has been seen regularly off New En-
gland and Nova Scotia, the British Isles, Nor-
way (especially More og Romsdal and Tronde-
lag Counties), British Columbia and
southeastern Alaska, Portugal and the Canary
Islands, southern California, La Plata in Ar-
gentina, the coast of South Africa, and in the
Coral Sea.
Significant sightings: A description of this type
of animal was first published in 1554 by the
Scandinavian archbishop Olaus Magnus, who
wrote that it was frequently seen in the fjords
around Bergen, Norway. He mentioned the vis-
ible mane, large eyes, and elevated head and
neck as prominent features.
In the spring of 1835, Captain Shibbles of the
brig Mangehan reported an animal with large
eyes and a long, maned neck 10 miles off
Provincetown, Massachusetts.
In the summer of 1846, James Wilson and
James Boehner were in a schooner near the
western shore of St. Margaret’s Bay, Nova Sco-
tia, Canada, when they saw a 70-foot animal
with a barrel-sized head and a mane. George
Dauphiney spotted a similar animal near Hack-
ett’s Cove about the same time.
Officers and passengers of the British mail-
packet Athenian observed a 100-foot, dark-
brown sea serpent between the Canary and
Cape Verde Islands in the North Atlantic on
May 6, 1863. Its head and tail were out of the
water, and it had something like a mane or sea-
weed on its head.
A “sea-giraffe” was observed by the crew of
the steamer Corinthian east of Newfoundland,
Canada, on August 30, 1913. It first appeared as
a large head with finlike ears and huge blue eyes,
followed by a 20-foot neck. It appeared attached
to a large, seal-like body with smooth fur col-
ored light brownish-yellow with darker spots.
Sports fisherman Ralph Bandini saw a maned
animal about a mile west of Mosquito Harbor
on San Clemente Island, California, in Septem-
ber 1920. Its neck was 5-6 feet thick, and the
eyes were 12 inches in diameter.
Around 1938, some 100 yards off the coast of
Skeffling, East Riding of Yorkshire, England,
Joan Borgeest watched a huge, green creature
with a flat head, protruding eyes, and a long
mouth that opened and closed. When she called
out to other people in the area, it dived and did
not reappear.
George W. Saggers watched a head and neck
with huge black eyes off Ucluelet, Vancouver Is-
land, British Columbia, Canada, in November
1947. Its dark-brown mane looked like a bundle
of warts.
Possible explanation: An elongated Seal (Sub-
order Pinnipedia) adapted for a semiabyssal ma-
rine existence.

Mermaid
Fish-tailed MEEBEING of the Atlantic Ocean.
Etymology: Middle English, mere (“sea”) +
maide (“maid”).
Variant names: Merfolk (plural), Merman
(for the male). Also Ben-varrey (Manx), Bocto-
gai (Irish), Ceasg (Gaelic), Dinny-mara (Manx),
Doinney varrey (Manx, for the male), H J¥-
MAND, Homen marinho (Portuguese), Liban,
Maighdean mhara (Irish), Merrow (Irish), Mer-
rymaid (in Cornwall, England), Mhaidan
mhare (Scots Gaelic), Morgan (Breton, “sea
woman”), Morverch (Breton, “sea daughter”),
Muirgheilt (Irish), Murdhucha’n (Irish), Mu-
nich (Irish).
Physical description: Head and torso of a
woman or man. Tapering fish body and tail in-
stead of legs.
Behavior: Fond of combing its hair and bask-
ing on the rocks. Said to be able to assume
human form and go ashore to markets and fairs.
Lures mariners to destruction on rocks. Said to
gather the souls of the drowned. Some families
claim to be descended from Mermaids.
Habitat: Underwater cities.
Distribution: Atlantic Ocean, especially off
the coast of Scotland.
Significant sightings: The Irish annals mention
several Mermaid encounters: in A.D. 558, when
the legendary Liban was caught in a net in Ul-
ster; in 887, when a 195-foot, white Mermaid
(more likely a whale) was washed up on the
coast; and in 1118, when two Mermaids were
caught near Waterford.
A Merman was caught by fishermen at Or-
ford, Suffolk, England, in 1197. It was bearded
and hairy (but bald) and otherwise like a
human. Sir Bartholomew de Glanville kept it at
the castle for about two months before it man-
aged to escape into the sea.
The medieval Fairy Melusine of Lusignan, in
the Poitou-Charentes Region of France, turned
into a Mermaid (in some traditions, a serpent)
every Saturday, a fact she was able to conceal
from her husband, Raymond of Poitou, for
many years, until he spoiled everything one
weekend by spying on her in the bath.
In 1403, when the dikes near Edam, the
Netherlands, broke in a storm, some young girls
found a Mermaid floundering in shallow water.
They got it into their boat, took it home, and
gave it clothes, but they were unable to make it
speak. It was said to have lived for fifteen years
afterward.
On his second voyage in search of a northeast
passage, two of Henry Hudson’s crew, Thomas
Hilles and Robert Raynar, saw a Mermaid off
Novaya Zemlya, Russia, at about 75° north lat-
itude on June 15, 1608. It was as big as a human
and had a woman’s back and breasts, white skin,
and long, black hair. When it dived, they could
see its speckled, porpoiselike tail.
Capt. Richard Whitbourne was one of several
witnesses to a Mermaid in the harbor at St.
Johns, Newfoundland, in 1610. Its shoulders
and back were square, white, and smooth, while
its lower part was like a “broad hooked arrow.”
In about 1667, Thomas Glover saw an
unidentified seal or Merman with a fishlike tail
on the Rappahannock River, Virginia.
Around 1698, a Merman with the bearded
face of an old man was seen off the Orkney Is-
lands, Scotland.
Sometime before 1791, Henry Reynolds ran
across what looked to be a youth of about six-
teen sitting in the sea near Castlemartin, Dyfed,
Wales. As he came closer, he realized it had a
huge, eel-like tail that moved constantly in a cir-
cular pattern. Its arms and hands seemed thick
MERMAID 329

and short. Brownish, ribbonlike streamers came
out of its forehead and flowed over its back.
Reynolds watched it for about an hour as it
swam near a rock only 35 feet away.
Schoolmaster William Munro of Thurso,
Highland, Scotland, was walking along the coast
at Sandside Bay in 1798 when he came across
what seemed to be a naked human female sitting
on a partially submerged rock and combing its
long, light-brown hair. He watched for about
three minutes before it dropped into the sea and
disappeared. Had it not been for the dangerous
place where it was sitting and other reports in
which people had seen a Mermaid for an hour or
more, he might have thought it was human.
On October 18, 1811, farmer John M’Isaac
saw a classic Mermaid sitting on a rock on the
Kintyre Peninsula near Cambeltown, Argyll and
Bute, Scotland. Its human-shaped upper half
was white, while the lower half was a reddish-
gray tail covered with hair. It seemed to be
combing its head-hair with its arms, which
seemed to be short in proportion to its body.
M’Isaac watched the animal for two hours, after
which it tumbled clumsily into the water and re-
mained some minutes stroking and washing its
chest. He then saw its face clearly, which he de-
scribed as human, with hollow eyes and a short
neck. Other witnesses came forward, and they
all signed depositions testifying to the truth of
the incident.
On August 15, 1814, two fishermen saw a
black Merman with a flat nose, curly hair, and
long arms swimming upright in the water off
Portgordon, Moray, Scotland. It was accompa-
nied by a female, who had breasts and long,
straight hair.
In May 1817, somewhere in the North At-
lantic Ocean at latitude 44°6', the crew of the
ship Leonidas observed a strange animal with a
fish’s tail and humanlike upper parts, swimming
erect about 2 feet out of the water for about six
330 MERMAID
hours. It had a whitish face, short arms, and
black hair. It remained looking at them for fif-
teen minutes at a time, then dived underneath
and appeared on the other side of the ship. It
was about 5 feet long from head to tail.
Around 1830, some people cutting seaweed
near Griminis on Benbecula in the Outer He-
brides of Scotland discovered a small Mermaid
splashing about in the sea. They tried chasing it,
but it swam farther away until a boy killed it by
throwing a rock at it. The creature washed up
on the shore a few days later. Its skin was white,
it had long, dark hair, and it looked like a three-
or four-year-old child with abnormally devel-
oped breasts and a salmonlike tail, though with-
out scales. The villagers made a coffin for it and
buried it nearby.
In July 1833, three fishermen swore before a
justice of the peace that they had caught a Mer-
maid some 30 miles off the coast of Yell in the
Shetland Islands, Scotland. It was about 3 feet
long, had breasts like a woman, arms about 9
inches long, and small hands with webbed fin-
gers. There were fins on each shoulder. Its head
was pointed, and it had blue eyes, two nostrils
between which was a thick facial bristle, a wide
mouth, and no ears or chin. The skin was white
on the front and light gray on the back. Its navel
was 9 inches below the breasts. The tail had two
lobes and resembled a halibut’s. It moaned piti-
fully, so they threw it back after three hours.
P. T. Barnum exhibited a 3-foot, faked “Fee-
jee mermaid” both in his American Museum in
New York and on his “Greatest Show on Earth”
circus tour from 1842 until 1864, when the
museum burned down. A similar monkey-fish
was donated to Harvard’s Peabody Museum in
1897.
In 1900, Alexander Gunn saw a Mermaid
near Sandwood, Highland, Scotland, as he went
to rescue a sheep lodged in a gully. It was
human-sized, with curly, reddish-yellow hair,
greenish-blue eyes, and arched eyebrows. Its
back was arched, and it looked frightened and
angry.
Around 1921, an animal with a fishlike tail
and a woman’s head and breasts was seen by a
fisherman at Dassen Island off Western Cape
Province, South Africa.

dugongs body. From an old postcard. (Fortean Picture
Library)
Sometime before 1936, a Scandinavian
hunter encountered a Mermaid with green hair,
beaming eyes, and a sad voice in the Strait of
Magellan near Punta Arenas, Chile.
Between 1960 and 1962, a Mermaid resem-
bling a normal woman was seen frequently off
Kilconly Point, County Kerry, Ireland.
MERMAID 331
Possible explanations:
(1) Manatees and Dugongs (Suborder
Sirenia) have been held responsible for
Mermaid stories for hundreds of years, but
it is difficult to see how these bulky, small-
headed, flippered mammals could be
mistaken for slender, long-haired, distinctly
human females, even at a distance by lonely
sailors. The explanation has always seemed
too glib and ironic. Sirenians live in the
warm waters of the Caribbean, the
Amazon, West Africa, Indian Ocean, and
the South Pacific, while Mermaids of the
European type are most often reported in
the North Atlantic. However, manatees and
dugongs often sit vertically in the water to
hold their young, which suckle the pectoral
mammary glands located at the base of each
flipper. Seaweed could conceivably
masquerade as hair. Their fishlike tails are
reminiscent of the SlREN and are the
primary reason for this order’s scientific
name.
(2) Seals (Suborder Pinnipedia) are much
more likely contenders, both physically and
behaviorally. The seal’s head is round, the
flippers flexible, the body sleek, and the
vocalizations expressive. Seals also like to
bask on rocks. Many cultures have myths of
seal-folk — humans descended from or
changed into seals (see Seikie).
(3) Some Mermaid sightings could be based
on occasional visits to the British Isles by
sealskin-clad, kayaking, nomadic Saami
peoples from northern Norway. This might
well explain lore about the Mermaid’s
upright appearance in the water, remarkably
human appearance, and liaisons with the
locals.
(4) An unknown species of seal with
strikingly humanlike characteristics.
(5) A surviving primitive ape that at some
point took to the water, perhaps an evolved
Oreopithecus, suggested by Mark A. Hall. It
is true that Oreopithecus lived in the Late
Miocene, 8-7 million years ago, in a
swampy forest habitat and perhaps subsisted
on aquatic plants. Presumably, such an
evolved ape would have developed webbed
hands and feet rather than a fish tail, so it
couldn’t account for seal- or manatee-
shaped animals.
(6) In the nineteenth century, many of the
fake mermaids exhibited in traveling shows
in Europe and the United States were said
to be manufactured by Japanese taxidermists
or Javan fishermen, who skillfully grafted
monkey torsos onto the bodies and tails of
large salmon or other fishes, augmented by
papier-mache.
(7) An expression of the myth of the fish-
tailed gods and goddesses of antiquity.

Messie
Freshwater Monster of South Carolina.
Variant name: Loch Murray monster.
Physical description: A large fish or humped
animal. Length, 30 feet.
Distribution: Lake Murray, South Carolina.
Significant sightings: In 1973, Buddy and
Shirley Browning and a friend were fishing
when a large fish attacked their boat. It did not
look like a sturgeon to them.
In late April 2000, Mary S. Shealey saw a
large lump resembling an overturned boat near
the Lake Murray Dam. She estimated it was 30
feet long and 10 feet high.
Possible explanation: The Atlantic sturgeon
(. Acipenser oxyrhynchus) grows to 14 feet in
length and ascends coastal rivers to spawn. It is
found in some South Carolina rivers, including
the Santee and Edisto, but none have been con-
firmed in Lake Murray.

MESSIE 333
Metoh-Kangmi
Alternate name for the Yeh of Central Asia.
Etymology: Kangmi (a contracted form of
gongs mi) is Sherpa (Sino-Tibetan) for “snow or
glacier man.” Metoh is an unknown or corrupt
word, though Ram Kumar Panday says it means
“unwashed.” Swami Pranavananda claims metoh
means “abominable” and is a variant of MiTeh,
which he defines as “man-bear” because the
creature can walk bipedally; he says the term
refers to the red or isabelline variety of the
Brown bear ( Ursos arctos). In modern Tibetan,
mi sdug means “disgusting.” See ABOMINABLE
Snowman.
Variant name: Kangmi.
Distribution: Tibet; Nepal.

Mi-Chen-Po
Variant name for the Yeh of Central Asia.
Etymology: Tibetan (Sino-Tibetan), “big
man.”
Variant names: Mi-bompo, Mi-shom-po
(“strong man”).
Physical description: Height, 7 feet. Dark
brown or reddish hair.
Distribution: Tibet.

Miga
Unknown SlRENIAN of Central Africa.
Variant name: Guidiara (in Guinea, “water
lion”).
Physical description: A large fish or octopus.
Head is like a gorgon’s. Tentacles.
Behavior: Sucks blood and eats the brains of
infants. Hides among rocks in the river and at-
tacks passing canoes.
Distribution: Mbomou River, Central African
Republic; Uele and Dungu Rivers, Democratic
Republic of the Congo; Niger River, Guinea.
Possible explanations:
(1) A F RESHWIER OCIOP US, though all
known cephalopod species are exclusively
marine, and none are sanguinivorous.
(2) Evidence for an extended range of the
West African manatee ( Trichechus
senegalensis) , proposed by Bernard
Heuvelmans. Adults are generally 9-10 feet
long. This animal is found in rivers,
estuaries, swamps, and lagoons from the
Senegal River in the north to the Cuanza
River, Angola, in the south, and it occurs as
far as 1 ,200 miles from the sea along the
Niger River. Its presence in certain
tributaries of the Congo has been suspected
but never confirmed. Its reputation as a
brain-eater is probably fear-based, since all
known sirenians are herbivorous.
(3) A giant Catfish (Family Siluridae),
suggested by Marc Micha.

Migo
Probable ClOCODIUAN of Australasia.
Variant names: Masalai (“spirit”), Massali,
Migaua, Mussali, Rui.
Physical description: Crocodile-like body.
Length, 30-35 feet. Gray skin. Horselike head
and neck. Sharp fangs. Ridged back. Turtlelike
legs-
Behavior: Swift swimmer.
Distribution: Lake Dakataua, on New Britain
in the Bismarck Archipelago, Papua New
Guinea.
334 METOH-KANGMI
Significant sightings: During World War II,
Wilfred T. Neill noticed crocodilians at the
edges of some inland lakes of New Britain he
was flying over.
In January and February 1994, a Japanese tel-
evision crew accompanied by Roy Mackal took
about five minutes of video footage apparently
showing a Migo in Lake Dakataua. One seg-
ment featured three different sections of a long
animal moving through the water.
Possible explanations:
(1) A surviving mosasaur, a group of large,
marine lizards related to modern monitors,
suggested by oceanographer Shohei Shirai.
Mosasaurs died out by the end of the
Cretaceous period, 65 million years ago.
(2) Roy Mackal at first thought the Migo
might be an evolved basilosaurid, a member
of a family of early whales that lived 42-33
million years ago, in the Middle to Late
Eocene.
(3) Mackal now thinks the video shows
three Saltwater crocodiles ( Crocodylus
porosus) in a mating ritual.

Mi-Go
Alternate name for the YETI of Central Asia.
Etymology: Tibetan (Sino-Tibetan) word.
Probably means “wild man,” though it also has
a sense of “robber” or “ruffian.” In modern
usage, mi go ba means to “not notice”; mi gos
means “untainted”; and mi gyo is an “unwaver-
ing state of meditation.”
Variant names: Me-gu, Megur, Miegye, Mig-
eye, Mighu (Bhutanese pronunciation), Migio,
Migu, Migyur (Bhutan), Mirgod, Mirka, Ui-go.
Physical description: Height, 6-7 feet. Cov-
ered in dark brown hair. Powerful build. Oval
head running to a point at the top. Apelike face
sparsely covered with hair.
Behavior: Nocturnal. Bipedal in open coun-
try. Walks with an unsteady gait. Moves on all
fours in the forest or swings in the trees. Visits
snowfields in search of saline moss on exposed
rocks. Makes a peculiar, whistling call. Has a
bad odor. Fears fire. Usually runs away when it
encounters humans and only attacks if it is
wounded.
Tracks: Imprints are 6-7 inches long and 4
inches wide at the broadest, though this seems
small for the animal’s height. Five distinct toes.
Clear instep. Pointed heel.
Habitat: Forested mountains.
Distribution: Eastern Himalaya Mountains of
Tibet; Nepal; Bhutan; Sikkim State, India.
Significant sighting: A female relative of the
third king of Bhutan, Jigme Dorji Wangchuck
(1952-1972), saw a Mighu in the mountains.

Mihirung Paringmal
Giant flightless BlKD of Australia.
Etymology: Tjapwurong (Australian), “giant
emu.”
Physical description: Like the Emu ( Dromaius
novae hollandiae) but larger.
Distribution: Western Victoria; New South
Wales; Queensland.
Significant sighting: Known from rock paint-
ings in Cape York, Queensland, and rock carv-

ings at Mootwingee, New South Wales. Aborig-
inal legends tell of giant birds that were still alive
when volcanos were erupting in the Western
District of Victoria, most recently in approxi-
mately 3000-2000 B.G
Possible explanations:
(1) Aboriginal memories of the recently
extinct Genyornis newtoni , a Late Pleistocene
species of dromornithid bird related to
ducks and geese that stood about 6 feet 7
inches tall and survived at least as recently as
26,000 years ago. Known from complete
skeletons near Lake Callabonna in South
Australia and isolated bones elsewhere.
(2) Aboriginal memories of Dromornis
stirtoni y one of the largest flightless birds
that ever lived, known from fossils in the
Northern Territory dating from the Late
Miocene to the Pleistocene, 1 5
million-30,000 years ago. Also a
dromornithid, it weighed more than 1,300
pounds, stood 9 feet tall, and had a huge
beak and jaw.

Milne
Unknown Bear of South America.
Etymology: Asheninca (Arawakan) word.
Physical description: Large bear. All-black
color. Powerful claws.
Behavior: Eats ants.
Distribution: Gran Pajonal Range, Ucayli De-
partment, Peru.
Significant sighting: Leonard Clark came
across a large, black bear tearing apart an ants’
nest in a decaying tree in northern Peru. It dived
into the river ahead of his raft. He was able to
shoot and kill it, but piranhas got to the body
before he could retrieve it.
Possible explanation: The Spectacled bear
( Tremarctos ornatus ), South America’s only bear,
is smaller and has distinctive white markings on
its face.

Mindye, Myndie.
Physical description: Length, 18-30 feet.
Hairy scales. Large head. Tongue with three
points. Black mane.

disgusting smell and leaves smallpox in its wake.
Able to kill with its glance. Oviparous. Not poi-
sonous.
Habitat: Eucalyptus scrub.
Distribution: Lower Murray River, South
Australia; the Grampians, Victoria.
Possible explanations:
(1) Distorted memory of the Diamond
python (. Morelia spilota spilotd)y found only
on the coast of New South Wales. It grows
to 1 5 feet long and has olive-black scales
with cream or yellow spots.
(2) A surviving Pleistocene madtsoiid snake,

Minhocao
Mystery AMPHIBIAN of Central and South
America.
Etymology: Portuguese, “giant earthworm.”
Variant names: Minocao, Sierpe (“snake,” in
Nicaragua).
Physical description: Serpentine. Length, up to
150 feet. Width, 15 feet. Black. Covered in
thick, bony armored skin or scales. Two horns
on its head. Piglike snout.
Behavior: Amphibious and subterranean.
Knocks over trees, collapses roads, and creates
new river channels with its burrowing in the
ground. Most active after rainy weather. Over-
turns boats. Attacks and eats horses and cattle
when fording rivers or lakes.
Tracks: Leaves a trail of deep, grooved furrows
3-10 feet wide.
Distribution: Mato Grosso do Sul, Goias,
Santa Catarina, Parana, and Bahia States, Brazil;
near San Rafael de Norte, Nicaragua; Rio Ma-
didi, Bolivia; Arapey area, Salto Department,
Uruguay.
Significant sightings: In 1849, Lebino Jose dos
Santos was traveling near Termas del Arapey,
Uruguay, when he heard of a dead Minhocao
that had caught itself in a narrow cleft of rock.
Its skin was as thick as pine-tree bark, and it had
scales like an armadillo.
About 1864, Antonio Jose Branco found the
road close to his home near Curitibanos, Santa
Catarina State, Brazil, undermined with 6-foot-
wide trenches about 3,000 feet in extent.
In the late 1860s, a Minhocao appeared on
the banks of the Rio das Caveiras near Laje,
Bahia State, Brazil, and was seen by Francisco
de Amaral Varella and Friedrich Kelling. It left
a wide trench in swampy ground.
Present status: Not reported since the nine-
teenth century.
Possible explanations:
(1) A giant, scaly lungfish related to
Lepidosiren , according to Auguste de Saint
Hilaire. The pectoral fins of the fish might
be confused with horns. The South
American lungfish (Z. paradoxa ) grows up
to 4 feet long and remains buried in the
mud of riverbeds, hibernating until the
rainy season when its reproductive cycle
begins. It prefers stagnant water where there
is little current.
(2) A surviving glyptodont, according to
Emil Budde, who supposes it was a
burrowing animal like the aardvark. This
heavily armored genus of giant armadillos
grew to 10 feet long and died out in North
and South America around 10,000 years
ago. However, the glyptodont’s fused body
armor would have interfered with tunneling
and negated any need to flee from
predators, especially since its macelike tail
could have delivered a deadly blow even to a
giant ground sloth. There is no fossil
evidence that glyptodonts burrowed.
(3) A surviving pampathere, a fossil
American armadillo that also disappeared
about 10,000 years ago; it had more flexible
armor than the glyptodont. The adult
Holmesina septentrionalis was 6 feet long and
weighed more than 500 pounds. Similarly,
there is no evidence that this animal
produced underground tunnels.
(4) A surviving archaic basilosaurid whale
that lives in freshwater lakes and swamps,
according to Bernard Heuvelmans.
However, it is now known that this animal
lacked armored skin.
(5) An unknown giant species of caecilian, a
wormlike amphibian that burrows
underground, suggested by Karl Shuker.
The chemosensory tentacles on its head
resemble horns. Some species have scales
embedded in their skin. The largest
MINHOCAO 337
underground species, Caecilia thompsoni,
lives in Colombia, is nearly 5 feet long, and
feeds on earthworms; the aquatic genus
Typhlonectes lives in South American rivers
and lakes and feeds on fishes and
invertebrates.
(6) A Giant Anaconda.
(7) Earthquake damage could be attributed
to the Minhocao’s tunneling.

Minnesota Iceman
WlIDMAN exhibited in a U.S. carnival. Said to
have come from Southeast Asia but possibly a
hoax.
Scientific name: Homo pongoides, given by
Bernard Heuvelmans in 1969.
Variant name: Bozo.
Physical description: Adult male hominid.
Height, 5 feet 10 inches. Covered in long brown
hair (3-4 inches long) except on the face. The
longer individual hairs seem to have an agouti
pattern of light bands. Pinkish skin. Large eye
sockets. Eyeballs are apparently missing. Pugged
nose with nostrils pointing upward. Wide
mouth with no eversion of the lips. Folds and
wrinkle lines around the mouth are apparently
humanlike. Short neck. A “cape” of long, black
hair flows around the neck. Wide shoulders.
Rounded ribcage. Trunk is ovoid in shape
rather than hourglass. Relatively long arms.
Wide wrist. Prominent pad on the heel of the
palm. Hands are spatulate and disproportion-
ately large, 11 inches long and more than 7
inches wide. Knuckles are poorly defined. Slen-
der thumb is fully opposed. Fingernails are
square, flat, and yellow but missing on the
thumb. Fingers and toes are larger and more ro-
bust than a man’s. Penis is slender, tapering,
and pale yellow. Scrotum is wrinkled and
brownish. Knees are only sparsely haired. Feet
are 8-10 inches wide, measured across the toes.
Profuse hair on the feet. Big toe is apposed, not
opposed as in apes. All toes are nearly the same
size, with bulbous terminal pads.
Significant sighting: After being alerted by
university student Terry Cullen that a carnival
was exhibiting a hairy man encased in ice, Ivan
Sanderson and Bernard Heuvelmans visited the
exhibit from December 16 to 18, 1968, at the
home of its owner, Frank Hansen, near Rolling-
stone, Minnesota. For three days, they exam-
ined the “iceman” and took detailed notes,
sketches, and photographs. Most significantly,
they noted that the creature had seemingly been
shot in its right eye, with the bullet displacing
the left eye; a pool of blood apparently sur-
rounded the back of its head. One forearm
seemed to have an open fracture caused by a
wound. Heuvelmans and Sanderson both de-
tected an unmistakable odor of rotting flesh ex-
uding from one corner of the exhibit. Gaseous
exudations apparently formed bursts of semi-
opaque, crystalline ice within the transparent
block. Sanderson claimed to have tracked down
hair samples taken from the iceman when it was
338 MI-NI-WA-TU
imported, “which,” he wrote, “turned up in a
university in the south.”
Hansen claimed that the iceman was the
property of an anonymous millionaire, who
later withdrew the real specimen from public
view and substituted a model, made from latex
and hair, that went on the carnival route for sev-
eral years afterward. His account of where the
original came from varies: Russian seal hunters
(or Japanese whalers) found it floating in Rus-
sia’s Sea of Okhotsk, already entombed in ice;
Hansen shot it himself, near Whiteface in
northern Minnesota; or he purchased it from an
exporter in Hong Kong.
Possible explanations:
(1) A synthetic fake, manufactured by
Hansen or a Hollywood special-effects
expert he hired. In 1981, it was claimed that
the late Howard Ball, who made models for
Disneyland, had created the original with
his son Kenneth, based on an artist’s
conception of Cro-Magnon man.
In 1973, I worked for two individuals who
were formerly associated with Hansen in the
carnival exhibition business; they told me
(with a certain amount of calculated
reluctance) that Hansen had a model made
“on his living-room floor.” However, this
information is still hearsay evidence, and
although I had, at the time, established a
limited amount of confidence as a “carney,”
I probably would not have been told the
truth if Hansen had actually imported a
Wildman from Southeast Asia. My sources,
after all, were in the business of exhibiting a
Brown agouti ( Dasyprocta variegata) as a
“giant rat from the sewers of Paris.”
(2) Heuvelmans believed Hansen, who was
a captain in the U.S. Air Force during the
Vietnam War, had shot or at least acquired
a Nguoi Rung in Vietnam in the mid-
1960s and smuggled it into the United
States in a military body bag. The creature
cannot be a normal human of any race or
even a composite produced by assembling
several species. However, Heuvelmans’s
identification of the animal as Neanderthal-
like ( Homo neanderthalensis) misses the
mark, since there is no characteristic
browridge or sloping forehead; the robust
arms and legs do match, though.
Heuvelmans apparently obtained
photographs showing the face before and
after it was thawed out for a short time.
(3) Mark Hall considers the iceman to be
closer in form to Homo erectus, which he
thinks is represented by the Ksy-Gyik,
Aim AS, or B arManu of Central Asia.

Miramar Toxodont
Mystery HOOFED MAMMAL of South America.
Significant sighting: From 1912 to 1914, pale-
ontologist Carlos Ameghino uncovered stone
tools in Late Pliocene strata (2 million years old)
along a cliff near Miramar, Buenos Aires
Province, Argentina. Among them was a stone
arrow or spear point embedded in the femur of a
toxodont, a member of a family of large, horse-
or rhinolike hoofed mammals that persisted in
South America until about 10,000 years ago.
Possible explanations:
(1) Unless humans were in South America
nearly 2 million years before the currently
accepted date, the artifacts (and presumably
the femur) must have been displaced from
later strata. A large, grazing toxodont
surviving into the Holocene would be a
likely food source for early hunters.
(2) The arrow was shot into the femur
hundreds of thousands of years after the
animal died.

Mitla
Mystery DOG or C AT of South America.
Etymology: Unknown. In Nahuatl (Uto-
Aztecan), mitla is the “abode of the dead,” hence
the name of the Mitla ruins near Oaxaca, Mex-
ico.
Physical description: Doglike cat the size of an
English foxhound. Black.
Distribution: Rio Madidi area, Bolivia.
Possible explanations:
(1) The dark-brown to black Bush dog
{Speothos venaticus) , suggested by Roy
Mackal, is found in this part of Bolivia. It is
rare and little seen over much of its range,
which extends from Panama to Brazil.
MITLA 341
(2) The blackish-gray Short-eared dog
(. Atelocynus microtis ), suggested by Karl
Shuker, is slightly larger (2-3 feet long) and
is also found east of the Andes in Bolivia. It
moves with a feline grace.

Mj ossie
F RESHmiER Monster of Norway.
Variant name: Mjoes orm.
Physical description: Length, 75 feet. Horse-
like head. Black mane. Large eyes.
Behavior: Most active in the summer months.
Eats livestock.
Distribution: Mjosa, Hedmark County,
Norway.
Significant sightings: In 1522, the monster was
stranded on a rock, where it was killed by a dar-
ing youth who shot a volley of arrows into its
eye. It washed up on land, and villagers burned
it. The skeleton lay undisturbed on the beach
for years until some German merchants ob-
tained permission to haul away the bones.
A young couple discovered a Mjoes orm par-
tially beached near their farm. It was brown-
black in color, appeared 1.5 feet thick, and had
a horselike head with no visible ears. About 30
feet of the body was out of the water. When the
man approached, it rose up and quickly moved
back into the water.

Supposed DOG-like flying jackal of East Africa.
Physical description: Batlike wings.
Behavior: Active at dusk. Flies or glides. Ut-
ters loud cries while flying. Raids mango and
pomegranate orchards.
Distribution: Tanzania.
Probable explanation: Misidentified Lord
Derby’s scaly-tailed squirrel ( Anomalurus der-
bianus), a 2 foot 6 inch gliding rodent found
throughout Central Africa, though less consis-
tently in Tanzania. This animal favors the bark
of some trees, removing one narrow strip each
night immediately adjacent to the previous
night’s strip.

stripes like a tabby cat. Small ears. Thick tail.
Behavior: Nocturnal. Has been heard to purr.
Known to have raided villages in order to kill
adults and carry off children.
Tracks: Leopardlike prints as big as a large
lion’s.
Distribution: The Tanzania coast near Lindi
and Mchinga.
Significant sightings: In 1922, William
Hichens was magistrate of Lindi, Tanzania,
when several constables were killed or mangled
by a huge cat with gray fur. Another outbreak of
maulings took place at Mchinga in the 1930s.
Possible explanations:
(1) A surviving species of one of several
large African fossil cats from the Pleistocene.
(2) An unknown, giant subspecies of the
African golden cat ( Felis aurata ), which has
a wide variety of coloration, from golden to
dark gray, and is reputed to be highly
aggressive when cornered. It occasionally
raids villages for poultry. It is not known
from Tanzania, though its range extends
into Kenya and Uganda.

Moddey Dhoe
Black Dog of the Isle of Man.
Etymology: Manx, “black dog.”
Variant names: Mauthe doog, Moddey dhoo.
Physical description: Size of a calf. Curled,
shaggy hair. Large, fiery eyes.
Distribution: Isle of Man, England.
Significant sightings: In the seventeenth cen-
tury, when Peel Castle, Isle of Man, was gar-
risoned, a shaggy, black dog came silently into
the guardhouse and made itself at home.
In 1927, near Ramsey, at the Milntown cor-
ner, Isle of Man, a friend of Walter Gill saw a
black dog with red eyes. He and the dog looked
at each other until the dog moved aside and al-
lowed him to pass. In 1931, at the same spot, a
doctor passed a dog nearly the size of a calf, with
bright, staring eyes.

Moha-Moha
Unknown FlSH of Australia.
Etymology: Said to be an Australian word
meaning “saucy fellow” or “dangerous turtle.”
Scientific name: Chelosauria love Hi, given by
William Saville-Kent in 1893.
Variant name: Moka moka.
Physical description: Length, 28-30 feet.
Greenish-white head and neck, with large white
spots. Band of white around the black eyes. Vis-
ible teeth. Round jaws, 18 inches long. Long
neck. Dome-shaped, slate-gray central body, 8
feet long and 5 feet high. Said to have alligator-
like legs and fingers. Dark-brown dorsal fin. Sil-
very, scaly, fish-shaped tail, 12 feet long.
Behavior: Said to be able to stand on its hind
feet and attack Aboriginal camps. Edible.
Distribution: Sandy Cape, Fraser Island,
Queensland, Australia.
Significant sighting: S. Lovell was walking
along the beach at Sandy Cape, Queensland, in
June 1890 when she saw the head and neck of a
huge animal resting partly on the shore. She
stood observing it for thirty minutes along with
two schoolgirls; then it twisted its tail fluke, sub-
merged, and vanished out to sea. Lovell said the
animal had been seen the previous week by an
Aboriginal boy.
Present status: Not seen since 1890.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Pitted-shelled turtle ( Carettochelys
insculpta) is a freshwater turtle found in the
river systems of the Northern Territory. It
has a distinctive, pale streak behind each eye
and a longish neck, and it grows to about 2
feet 5 inches long.
(2) The Eastern snake-necked turtle
(Chelodina longicollis) occurs throughout
eastern Queensland in swamps, rivers, and
billabongs. It has a relatively long neck, but
its total length is only 10 inches.
(3) A surviving placoderm fish, suggested by
David Alderton. Pterichthyodes of the
Middle Devonian, 375 million years ago,
had an armored head and trunk shield that
resembled a turtle shell, but the fish was
only 6 inches long. Also, it did not have a
long neck. Larger placoderms such as
Dunkleosteus reached up to 18 feet in length
but were shaped more like sharks or bony
fishes.

clawed toes. Also makes a furrow like that made
by a large snake or a wagon wheel.
Habitat: Caves in river banks.
Distribution: Bai River, Likouala aux Herbes
River, Likouala Swamp, Lake Makele, Sangha
River, Lake Tebeki, Lake Tele, and Lower
Ubangi River, Republic of the Congo; Ikelemba
River, Democratic Republic of the Congo;
Boumba, Cross, Loponji, Mbame, Ngoko,
Ntem, and Sanaga Rivers, Cameroon.
Significant sightings: In the mid-eighteenth
century, French missionaries in the area of
MOKELE-MBEMBE 345
Pygmy hunters are said to have speared and killed a Mokele-mbembe at Lake Tele around 1959. (William M. Reb-
samen/Fortean Picture Library)
Gabon or the western Republic of the Congo
reported finding clawed tracks about 3 feet in
circumference and 7-8 feet apart.
Capt. Freiherr von Stein zu Lausnitz collected
information on the Mokele-mbembe in the Re-
public of the Congo for the German govern-
ment during the Likuala-Kongo Expedition of
1913. Natives told him it had smooth skin, was
the size of an elephant, had a long and flexible
neck, and had a long tusk or horn. He was
shown a path made by the animal to get at its
preferred food, a white liana blossom.
Ivan T. Sanderson and Gerald Russell heard a
loud roar and saw a huge animal swim out from
a submerged cave in Mamfe Pool on the Cross
River, Cameroon, in 1932 or 1933. All they
could see was a dark head larger than a hippo’s,
which created a wave when it submerged. Sev-
eral months earlier, they had come across large,
hippolike tracks near the river.
About 1935, Firman Mosomele saw a
Mokele-mbembe in the Likouala aux Herbes
River near Epena, Republic of the Congo. It
had a reddish-brown, snakelike head, and its
neck was 6-8 feet long.
Around 1959, a Mokele-mbembe was killed
by Pygmies at Lake Tele, Republic of the
Congo, by putting up a barrier in a waterway
that the animal used to enter the lake; the cor-
nered animal was then speared to death. They
cut it up and ate the meat, but everyone is said
to have died shortly afterward.
In the 1960s, Nicolas Mondongo was hunt-
ing for monkeys along the Likouala aux Herbes
River between Bandeko and Mokengui when a
huge animal reared out of the water about 40
feet away. Its head and neck together were 6 feet
in length, and it had four sturdy legs and a long
tail. Mondongo watched it for three minutes be-
fore it submerged.
346 MOKELE-MBEMBE
In February 1980, Roy Mackal and James
Powell went on a reconnaissance expedition that
reached Epena on the Likouala aux Herbes
River, Republic of the Congo, and they col-
lected firsthand reports of the Mokele-mbembe.
The Herman Regusters Expedition to Lake
Tele, Republic of the Congo, from October 9 to
December 9, 1981, made several observations of
disturbances in the water caused by a large ani-
mal. A long neck was seen for five minutes dur-
ing one encounter and for a few seconds on an-
other occasion. On November 4, Regusters heard
and recorded an animal making a loud growl.
Roy Mackal, Richard Greenwell, and Justin
Wilkinson conducted an expedition to the Lik-
ouala Region, Republic of the Congo, from Oc-
tober 27 to December 3, 1981. They encoun-
tered an odd wake made by a large animal in the
Likouala River between Itanga and Mahounda
and examined the trail made by an unknown
animal upstream from Djeke months earlier and
discovered by Emmanuel Moungoumela.
A Congolese expedition led by zoologist Mar-
cellin Agnagna surveyed the Likouala Swamp
and Lake Tele area from April 3 to May 17,
1983. Lor twenty minutes on May 1, Agnagna
and others saw a 15-foot animal with a wide
back and long neck swimming in the lake;
though the animal was observed through the
telephoto lens of a movie camera, the film was
on an incorrect setting and proved worthless.
The expedition also found recent footprints
near Djeke.
The British Operation Congo, led by Wil-
liam Gibbons from January to June 1986, re-
turned from Lake Tele with little evidence,
though it confirmed the existence of turtles,
pythons, and crocodiles in the lake.
A Japanese film crew led by Tatsuo Watanabe
shot a controversial video in September 1992
showing fifteen seconds of what they thought
was a Mokele-mbembe crossing Lake Tele.
A village security officer at Moloundou,
Cameroon, saw a Le’kela-bembe in the Boumba
River in February 2000. The animal stopped
swimming downstream when it saw a ferry and
moved away upstream.
Possible explanations:
(1) Sauropod dinosaurs, herbivorous
quadrupeds that ranged in total body length
from 20 to 145 feet, had small heads, long
necks, long tails, and massive limbs. They
had five toes on all four limbs, with at most
a single clawed toe on each forefoot and
perhaps three on the hind feet. There were
two types of sauropods, distinguished
primarily from characteristics of the teeth:
large animals with thick, spoon-shaped
teeth, such as Brachiosaurus, and smaller
animals with longer snouts and thin, peg-
shaped teeth, such as Diplodocus. The
earliest sauropod fossil is Vulcanodon y a 33-
foot animal from Zimbabwe and dating
from the Early Jurassic, 200 million years
ago; other early species have been found in
Germany and China. Sub-Saharan African
sauropods include Barosaurus, Brachiosaurus ,
and Dicraeosaurus from Tanzania and
Janenschia and Malawisaurus from Malawi.
Presumably, the last sauropods died off at
the end of the Cretaceous, 65 million years
ago.
(2) Ouranosaurus y a 24-foot, bipedal
iguanodontid dinosaur, was excavated in the
Sahara Desert in Niger in 1966. Its
distinctive dorsal spines are 2 feet high and
may have supported a sail-like membrane.
This explanation was proposed by Herman
Regusters, who misidentified the fossil as a
sauropod and alleged that one vertebra was
radiocarbon-dated as only a few thousand
years old. In fact, the remains date from the
early Cretaceous, some 110 million years
ago.
(3) An unknown species of giant Monitor
(Varanidae) or Iguana (Iguanidae) lizard.
Both groups include semiaquatic species,
and some iguanas are herbivorous.
(4) Large African softshell turtle ( Trionyx
triunguis) , called NDENDEKI by locals living
in the Lake Tele area and said to grow up to
1 5 feet in diameter. Marcellin Agnagna’ s
1983 sighting may have involved this turtle.
(5) An African elephant ( Loxodonta
africand) swimming with its trunk raised.
(6) The Nile crocodile ( Crocodylus niloticus ),
which can grow to over 20 feet long.
(7) During the rainy season,
MOKELE-MBEMBE 347
Hippopotamuses ( Hippopotamus amphibius)
are said to hibernate in caves along the
riverbanks. If disturbed, one of them might
surprise and confuse the unwary traveler.
This might explain Ivan Sanderson’s
sighting in Mamfe Pool, Cameroon.
(8) The West African manatee ( Trichechus
senegalensis) grows to about 12 feet in length
and might be mistaken for a larger animal if
encountered suddenly. It may be found in
certain rivers of the Republic of the Congo.

Distribution: Louisiana, Missouri.
Significant sightings: Terry and Wally Harri-
son, ages eight and five, were playing in the
woods near their property in Louisiana, Mis-
souri, on the afternoon of July 11, 1972. Their
sister Doris, fifteen, heard them scream and
looked out to see a manlike creature, about 6-7
feet tall, with long, black hair carrying a dead dog
under its arm and standing next to a tree. Their
father, Edgar Harrison, found a footprint and a
handprint on nearby Marzolf Hill on July 19.
Bill Suddarth and his wife found some nar-
rower, three-toed tracks in their garden after
hearing a high-pitched howl on August 3, 1972.
Possible explanations:
(1) The footprints were pronounced a hoax
by the director of the Oklahoma City Zoo.
(2) Unidentified flying object (UFO)
reports in the area at the same time
encouraged some of the early investigators
to speculate on an alien origin.
(3) Some reports may have been American
black bears ( Ursus americanus).

Mongitore’s Monstrous Fish
Mystery FlSH of the Mediterranean Sea.
Scientific name: Oxypterus mongitori, given by
Constantin Samuel Rafinesque in 1814.
Physical description: Length, 45 feet 6 inches.
Circumference, 23 feet 7 inches. Blowhole.
Two dorsal fins. Tail, 10 feet 2 inches long.
Distribution: Mediterranean Sea, off Sicily.
Significant sighting: In September 1741, a
monstrous fish was stranded near Licata, Sicily,
Italy. It had a blowhole and powerful teeth.
Possible explanations:
(1) A Basking shark ( Cetorhinus maximus ),
since no known whales have two dorsal fins.
These sharks are known to grow to more
than 40 feet.
(2) A Mediterranean occurrence of the
unknown MAGENTA Whale, which has two
dorsal fins.

Mongolian Death Worm
Huge SNAKE-like animal or INVERTEBRATE of
Central Asia.
Variant names: Allergorhai-horhai, Allghoi
khorkhoi, Olgoi khorkhoi (Mongolian/Altaic,
“intestine worm”), Shar khorkhoi.
Physical description: Length, 2-5 feet. Dark
red. A yellow variety (Shar khorkhoi) is also said
to exist, though it is rarer. Thick. No differenti-
ated head, tail, or feet.
Behavior: Comes to the surface in June and
July. Squirts a bubbly, acidic, lethal poison from
one end of its body. Said to have killed a geolo-
gist when it touched an iron rod he was holding,
possibly by electrical shock.
Habitat: Areas of the desert where a parasitic
herb, Goyo ( Cynomorium songaricurri), is found
in the roots of saxaul bushes.
Distribution: Region around Ihbulag and Da-
landzadgad, southern Gobi Desert, Mongolia;
in the Nemegt Uul, Mongolia. Marie-Jeanne
Kofman heard rumors of a similar animal in the
Kalmyk Republic, Russia.
Possible explanations:
(1) Unknown species of giant Worm lizard
(Amphisbaenidae), part of a family of
limbless lizards with no external eyes and
ears. These creatures live in underground
burrows and move in a serpentine fashion.
In the 1990s, there were several discoveries
of fossil amphisbaenids in Central Asia,
including Mongolia.
(2) A highly specialized giant form of
Earthworm (Subclass Oligochaeta).
(3) Unknown species of venomous Sand
boa (Eryx spp.).
(4) Unknown species of venomous elapid
snake similar to the Southern death adder
The MONGOLIAN DEATH WORM of the Gobi Desert, said
to squirt poison and electrocute its victims. (Phillippa Fos-
ter/Fortean Picture Library)
( Acanthopis antarcticus) of Australia, which
grows to over 3 feet; suggested by John L.
Cloudsley-Thompson.

Mongolian Goat-Antelope
Mystery HOOFED MAMMAL of Central Asia.
Physical description: Size of a goat. Brown.
Small, spreading horns. High back.
Behavior: Runs faster than a sheep or goat but
350 MONGOLIAN DEATH WORM
slower than an antelope. Grazes in groups of
four or five.
Habitat: Rocky ravines.
Distribution: DundgovT Province, Mongolia.
Significant sighting: Discovered by local peo-
ple, who keep them secret from outsiders.

Monkey Man
Monkeylike ENTITY of the Indian subcontinent.
Variant name: Bear man.
Physical description: Variously reported as a
monkey, a man with a monkey face, a man with
a mask and helmet, or even an alien or robot.
Height, 4 feet 6 inches-6 feet. Glowing red
eyes. Said to have flashing green and red lights
on its chest. Metallic claws.
Behavior: Can jump 20 feet into the air from
a crouching position. Bites people while they are
sleeping. Sometimes dressed in white, black, or
silver. Said to speak the Bhojpuri language.
Distribution: Around New Delhi, Noida, and
Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh State, India; Nalbari,
Assam State, India; Ahmadabad, Gujarat State,
India.
Significant sightings: Reports of a belligerent
monkey or a masked man began in early April
2001 in the suburbs of Ghaziabad, India. Peo-
ple went to the police with what appeared to be
deep scratches or bites. By May 16, the panic
had spread to Noida and New Delhi; there had
been hundreds of reports and many injuries,
three panic deaths had occurred, several people
were mistaken for the entity and beaten, and
more than 3,000 policemen on motorcycles,
armed with rifles, were patrolling east Delhi to
calm down residents. Typical reports were
vague and varied: On May 10, a masked man
struck the stomach of Saroj Sharma in
Chhaprola; the next night, residents saw a shad-
owy figure that jumped like a monkey and had
glowing red eyes. On May 13, an intruder
dressed in white bandages attacked the wife and
sister of M. P. Singh in Noida.
Bearlike or wolflike humanoids were reported
in late May 2001 in the Nalbari District, Assam
State. The Assam Science Society interviewed
sixteen witnesses, who admitted they were half
asleep when they felt something with sharp nails
trying to grab them.
Another Monkey man was reported in the
Khanpur suburb of Ahmadabad in early Febru-
ary 2002. The creature was dressed in black, had
curly hair, wore a mask, and hopped from roof
to roof.
Possible explanations:
(1) The police at first suspected many of the
attacks were made by a man wearing a
monkey mask.
(2) The final report by the New Delhi police,
issued on June 19, 2001, concluded that fear
and panic were behind all the sightings, ruled
out a conspiracy by pranksters, and said there
was no evidence for any bizarre creature that
could have caused the attacks. Forensic
specialists noted that most of the injuries
were superficial and self-inflicted accidentally
during panic attacks.

Mono Grande
Unknown PRIMATE of South America.
Etymology: Spanish, “big monkey.”
Variant names: Mojan (Arawakan), Mono rey
(“king monkey”).
Physical description: Tailless, apelike creature.
Height, 5-6 feet.
Behavior: Arboreal. Runs with an odd, leap-
ing gait. Call is an eerie howling sound. Throws
stones at huts at night. Uses branches as
weapons. Said to interbreed with the Indians.
Distribution: Serrania de Parija of Colombia
and Venezuela; eastern Venezuela; Rio Paute,
eastern Ecuador; Rio Madidi area, Bolivia; pos-
sibly in Peru during colonial times.
MONO GRANDE 351
Significant sightings: In 1968, archaeologist
Pino Turolla glimpsed two apelike creatures in
the Venezuelan jungle.
In 1997, British travel writer Simon Chap-
man searched for the Mono rey of northern Bo-
livia but found no compelling evidence. He
heard rumors that a pelt had been purchased by
a foreigner for DNA analysis and that a living
animal had been exhibited at the zoo in Santa
Cruz, Bolivia.

Montana Nessie
F RESHmiER Monster of Montana.
Etymology: After Scotland’s NESSIE.
Variant name: Flattie.
Physical description: Apparently, two types of
animal are involved. Large animal — Eel-shaped.
Length, 20-40 feet. Brown to bluish-black.
Head like a snake’s. Distinctive, steel-black eyes.
Dorsal fin sometimes reported. Small animal —
Like a large fish. Length, 6-10 feet.
Behavior: Swims on the surface with vertical
undulations. Often seen cavorting in the water,
which could be either playfulness or feeding be-
havior.
Distribution: Flathead Lake, Montana.
Significant sightings: In 1889, Capt. James C.
Kerr, piloting the steamboat U.S. Grant, no-
ticed a whalelike object. Thinking it to be an ap-
proaching boat, he kept an eye on it but soon re-
alized the object was an animal 20 feet long. His
passengers became frightened, and one gun-
toting man pulled out his rifle and shot at it. He
missed, and the creature submerged.
On May 27, 1937, L. J. Eakins saw what
looked like a large dog swimming down the
Flathead River. It held its head out of the water
and looked at him once as he shouted at it.
H. W. “Buck” Black and his family were re-
turning to Poison by boat on July 10, 1949,
when they saw a large fish about 150 feet away.
Six feet of its back was showing, but the head
was submerged. Black is convinced it was a 1 0-
to 12-foot sturgeon.
Howard Gilbert and his wife were driving
along the eastern shore on June 12, 1955, when
they saw two large fishes, one 8 to 1 0 feet long,
cavorting in the water. After two minutes, they
submerged, one disappearing and the other
swimming underwater toward the shore.
The E. E. Funke family saw a shiny, black an-
imal with a dorsal fin swimming toward their
boat dock on Indian Bay on August 19, 1965. It
created a boat-sized wake.
U.S. Army Maj. George Cote and his son
Neal saw a black object, as long as a telephone
pole and twice as thick, surfacing and diving in
Yellow Bay on May 25, 1985. It had a head like
a snake’s and a tail like an eel’s. They saw a sim-
ilar animal on July 1, 1987, near Lakeside.
Rich Gaffney and his family watched a
NESSIE-like animal surface about 50 yards away
amid a school of fish in Skeeko Bay on July 29,
1993. It had shiny humps and was 15-20 feet
long.
On June 20, 1998, three brothers were wake-
boarding on the lake when they saw three dark-
green humps in the water ahead. The animal the
humps belonged to was about 30 feet long, with
rough scales. It dropped below the surface and
swam past their boat, leaving a small wake.
Present status: Local investigator Paul Fugle-
berg has identified ninety different sightings from
1889 to 1999. The Montana Department of
Fish, Wildlife, and Parks had collected seventy-
eight sightings by 1998; 32 percent fit the de-
scription of a large sturgeon, while the other 68
percent describe a snakelike animal with humps.
Possible explanations:
(1) The White sturgeon ( Acipenser
transmontanus) , though not officially known
from this lake, reaches lengths of 20 feet
352 MONTANA NESSIE
and is the largest freshwater fish in North
America. It is dark gray or pale olive above
and white to pale gray on the underside.
The report that a sturgeon 7 feet 6 inches
long was caught here on May 28, 1955, by
C. Leslie Griffith is not accepted by all
investigators; the fish can still be seen in the
Polson-Flathead Historical Museum,
however. The smaller, fishlike animal could
be a sturgeon.
(2) The Northern elephant seal ( Mirounga
angustirostris) matches the size, but
unfortunately, this is a marine mammal.
(3) A miniature submarine has been
suggested.

Moolgewanke
Alternate name for the BUNYIP of Australia.
Etymology: Australian word.
Physical description: Half man and half fish.
Has a matted crop of reeds instead of hair.
Behavior: Call is a booming sound.
Distribution: Lake Alexandrina, South Aus-
tralia.
Possible explanations:
(1) The booming calls might be the cry of
the Brown bittern ( Botaurus poiciloptilus ) .
(2) Episodic explosions like guns firing have
been heard in at least three seismically active
parts of Australia: near Kooroocheang,
Victoria; in Western Australia; and along
the Darling River in New South Wales.
They have been attributed to micro-
earthquakes.

Morag
FRESHWATER MONSTERof Scotland.
Etymology: From the Gaelic a’ Mhorag, a fem-
inine diminutive derived from the name of the
loch.
Variant names: Maggie, Mhorag.
Physical description: Most common descrip-
tion is of a large, rounded object like an over-
turned boat. Length, 20-30 feet. Dark gray or
brown. Rough skin. Flat, snakelike head. Slit
eyes. Wide mouth. Neck, 5-6 feet long. From
three to five humps, 15-20 feet in length. Four
legs with three toes.
Behavior: Swims swiftly.
Distribution: Loch Morar, Highland, Scotland.
Significant sightings: James Macdonald told
the story of his encounter with a creature called
Mhorag in January 1887, but it appeared to be
more like a MERMAID or KELPIE rather than a
NESSIE-like animal.
John Gillies, Noel O’Donnell, and a boatload
of tourists saw a 20-foot monster with five dis-
tinct humps off the southern shore of the loch
on July 30, 1948.
In September 1958, George R. Cooper
sketched a portrait of the animal, which had the
appearance of a drifting log.
John MacVarish, barman at the Morar Hotel,
was in his boat opposite Bracora on August 27,
1968, when he saw a long neck moving slowly
down the loch. It stretched 5-6 feet out of the
water and had a flat, snakelike head.
On the evening of August 16, 1969, Morag
struck the stern of a motorboat piloted by Dun-
can McDonell and William Simpson, knocking
a teakettle off the stove. McDonell hit the ani-
mal with an oar, while Simpson shot at it with a
rifle, apparently frightening it off. It was 25-30
feet long with three low humps and had a
MORAG 353
brown, snakelike head about 12 inches across
the top.
On March 3, 1981, Sydney Wignall, Bryan
Woodward, and John Evans were in an inflat-
able boat west of Brinacory Island when they
saw two black humps traveling at the same
speed as their boat. They were visible for about
20 seconds.

Morgawr
Sea Monster of Cornwall.
Etymology: Cornish, “sea monster.” Probably
coined by Noel Wain of the Falmouth Packet in
1976.
Variant name: Durgan Dragon.
Physical description: Length, 17-20 feet. Gray
skin. Long neck. Several large humps. Long tail.
Behavior: Said (by Tony Shiels) to be attracted
to naked women, especially young Wiccans.
Distribution: Cornwall, England, especially
Falmouth Bay.
Significant sightings: On August 3, 1906, offi-
cers Spicer and Cuming of the American
transatlantic liner St. Andrew saw a sea monster
with a head 18 feet long and huge jaws and
teeth while rounding Land’s End, Cornwall.
The anonymous “Mary F.” submitted two
photographs of an apparent sea monster al-
legedly taken in February 1976. Published in
the Falmouth Packet on March 5, they show a
three-humped object with a long, downward-
curving neck. Subsequent research showed that
the photos were probably hoaxed by Irish
busker and trickster Tony “Doc” Shiels.
On July 10, 1985, Sheila Bird and her
brother Eric watched a 20-foot, gray animal off
Porthscatho in Lalmouth Bay for several min-
utes before it suddenly sunk vertically and van-
ished.
Morgawr was spotted in early September
1995 off Rosemullion Head by Gertrude
Stevens. She saw a small head on a long neck
and a broad, flat tail.
In August 1999, John Holmes took some
video footage of an animal with a snakelike head
and neck in Gerran’s Bay, Cornwall.
Derek and Irene Brown saw a series of humps
and a periscope-like head and neck off Pal-
mouth on May 16, 2000.
Possible explanations:
(1) Largely a series of hoaxes and dubious
stories created or encouraged by Tony Shiels
beginning in the late 1970s, with some
possibly genuine events and traditions
mixed in.
(2) Basking sharks ( Cetorhinus maximus)
visit the coast frequently from May to July.
The second-largest shark in the world, it
reportedly grows to 40-50 feet and has
distinctive gill slits that nearly encircle the
head.
(3) Various types of whales and porpoises,
unexpectedly seen.

Mosqueto
F reshwoer Monster of New York.
Etymology: Oneida (Iroquoian) word.
Distribution: Lake Onondaga, New York.
Significant sighting: The Oneidas had a legend
that a great animal came from the lake and
killed many Indians.
Possible explanation: Seals apparently visit this
lake from time to time. A 6-foot, 100-pound
seal was shot in the lake by George F. Kennedy
on April 28, 1882.

Mothman
Llying Humanoid or Big Bird of Ohio and
West Virginia.
Etymology: Coined by a journalist on Novem-
ber 16, 1966, supposedly after the Killer Moth
character in the Batman comics series.
Variant name: Birdman.
Physical description: Height, 5-7 feet. Gray or
brown. No head. Luminous, bright-red eyes,
apparently set in the shoulders. No arms.
Broader than a man. Wingspan of 10 feet.
Wings are folded against the back when not in
use. Humanlike legs.
Behavior: Walks with a shuffle. Very swift
flight (up to 100 miles per hour). Wings make a
squeaking noise but do not flap when in flight.
Distribution: The Ohio River valley centering
on Point Pleasant, West Virginia, and Gallipo-
lis, Ohio. Also Salem and St. Albans, West Vir-
ginia; Lowell, Ohio; Maysville, Kentucky.
Significant sightings: In the first half of the
The Mothman of Point Pleasant, West Virginia.
(Richard Svens son)
twentieth century, a large bird with a wingspan
of 12 feet and dark- red feathers was seen occa-
sionally around the Ohio and Kanawha Rivers
in West Virginia.
Roger and Linda Scarberry and Steve and
Mary Mallette were driving near the TNT area,
a World War II-era munitions dump north of
Point Pleasant, West Virginia, on November
15, 1966, when they encountered a 7-foot, hu-
manoid figure with glowing red eyes. Scarberry
floored his Chevy, but the creature took wing
and pursued them, at speeds up to 1 00 miles an
hour, all the way to the city limits. It flew with-
out flapping its wings.
Two Point Pleasant firemen, Paul Yoder and
Benjamin Enochs, were in the TNT area on
November 18, 1966, when they encountered a
giant bird with red eyes.
On November 26, 1966, Marvin Shock and
Ewing Tilton watched four large birds for sev-
eral hours in daylight as they flew around and
MOTHMAN 355
perched in trees near Lowell, Ohio. They were
4—5 feet long with wingspans of 10 feet. Their
breasts were charcoal gray, their backs were dark
brown with light flecks, their heads were red-
dish, and their bills were straight and about 6
inches long.
On November 28, 1966, Richard West of
Charleston, West Virginia, saw what looked like
Batman on the roof next door. It was about 6
feet tall with wings 6-8 feet wide and big red
eyes.
Present status: The Mothman Prophecies was
released in 2002 as a feature film starring
Richard Gere as the investigator.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Sandhill crane ( Grus canadensis) is
about the size of a great blue heron but is
gray, mottled with rust stains. It has a
wingspan up to 6 feet 5 inches. Its
migration route is not through West
Virginia, but strays sometimes are reported.
(2) A Snowy owl ( Nyctea scandiaca) was
shot by a farmer in Gallipolis Ferry, West
Virginia, in December 1966. This nearly
pure-white bird is 2 feet long, with a 4-foot
wingspread. Normally found no farther
south than Michigan, individual owls are
occasionally seen as far south as Louisiana,
though usually in a feeble condition.
(3) A Barn owl ( Tyto alba), suggested by Joe
Nickell, can have a wingspan of 3 feet 6
inches and sometimes appears deceptively
large.
(4) The Turkey vulture ( Cathartes aura) is
common throughout Ohio and West
Virginia in the summer. A red-headed
carrion-feeder with a wingspan of nearly 6
feet, it is more than 2 feet long and has a
distinctive, bare, red head.
(5) A GIANT OWL has sometimes been
reported in the area.
(6) An extraterrestrial entity, because
unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and
other odd phenomena were frequently
reported in the vicinity at the time.

Mourou-Ngou
Wvter Lion of Central Africa.
Etymology: Banda (Ubangi), “water leopard.”
The name is also used for the Giant otter shrew
( Potomogale velox) , an aquatic insectivore nearly
2 feet long.
Variant names: Muru-ngu, Nze-ti-gou
(Sango/Creole, “water leopard”), Ze-ti-ngu.
Physical description: Shaped like a leopard.
Length, about 8-12 feet. Brownish, striped, or
dappled with blue and white spots. Small head.
Glowing eyes. Large fangs. Tail like a leopard’s,
though hairier.
Behavior: Amphibious. Nocturnal. Roaring
cry like a strong wind. Hunts in pairs. Kills hip-
popotamuses and elephants. Inflicts long, deep
wounds on its prey, even hippos. Said to capsize
canoes and seize humans.
Tracks: Larger than a lion’s. Claw marks. De-
scribed as “containing a circle in the middle.”
356 MOUROU-NGOU
Habitat: Caves in riverbanks.
Distribution: Bamingui, Bangoran, Gribin-
gui, Iomba, Kotto, Koukourou, Mbari, and
Ouaka Rivers in the Central African Republic;
Chari River, Chad.
Significant sightings: In August 1910 or 1911,
a boat containing French-African riflemen was
overturned in the Bamingui River by a Mourou-
ngou, which seized one of the men in its mouth
and dragged him underwater. The animal
looked like a leopard but with stripes. The
records at the outpost at Ndele confirm that a
rifleman had been lost.
In 1920 and 1970, hippos were found slashed
by an unknown animal along the Chari River,
Chad.
On May 26, 1930, French civil servant Lu-
cien Blancou shot a hippo on the River Mbari.
During the night, a roaring animal that was not
a Nile crocodile bit into the carcass.
In 1936, Lucien Blancou was told at Kaga
Bandoro, Central African Republic, that a
Mourou-ngou had carried off men from the vil-
lage of Dogolomandji, about 20 miles to the
southeast on the Gribingui River. Unlike a
crocodile, it left no trace of its victims.
In the 1950s, a Water lion was caught in a
fishnet on the Bangoran River. The villagers
killed it and retained the cranium, which may
still be kept by the village headman.
A fisherman was nearly knocked into the
Bamingui River when a large animal swam past
him in February 1985.
Possible explanations:
(1) An unknown species of large crocodile
of the genus Osteolaemus, with a head that is
shorter and rounder than the Nile crocodile
(■ Crocodylus niloticus) , suggested by Bernard
Heuvelmans in 1955.
(2) A surviving saber-toothed cat, adapted
for an aquatic lifestyle, suggested by
Heuvelmans in 1978.

Muhlambela
Mystery SNAKE of South Africa.
Physical description: Length, nearly 12 feet.
Crest.
Behavior: Emits a deerlike bleat. Strikes at
people’s heads by hanging from a tree.
Distribution: South Africa.
Possible explanation: A Black mamba {Den-
droaspis polylepis) with molted skin on its head
that forms a crestlike ornament. This deadly
snake grows to 10 feet in length.

Muhuru
Unknown L IZARD of East Africa.
Etymology: Unknown. Muhuru is the name of
a bay in Lake Victoria as well as a dialect of Suba
(Bantu), spoken by about 15,000 people in
Kenya.
Physical description: Length, 9-12 feet. Dark
gray. Sail-like structure on its back.
Distribution: Eastern Rift Valley, Kenya.
Significant sighting: Cal Bombay and his wife
were driving through the Rift Valley in 1963
when their path was blocked by a gray, sail-
backed reptile lying across the road.
Possible explanation: A surviving pelycosaur
reptile, such as Edaphosaurus or Dimetrodon ,
which died out in the Late Permian, 275 mil-
lion years ago. They both had tall neural spines
between the neck and pelvis that supported a
sail-like membrane; the membrane presumably
provided a surface for body-temperature control
and may also have been useful in defense or sex-
ual display behavior.

MUHURU 357
Mystery Muhuru lizard seen by Cal Bombay in Kenya in 1963. ( William M. Rebsamen)
Mulahu
GlANTHOMINID of Central Africa.
Etymology: Possibly Banda (Ubangi) word.
Physical description: Height, 7-8 feet. Weight,
800 pounds. Covered with dark hair. Black on
the back. Long white hairs on the face.
Behavior: Bipedal. Aggressive nature.
Distribution: Ituri Forest, Democratic Repub-
lic of the Congo.
Significant sighting: The Italian explorer At-
tilio Gatti heard of the Mulahu in the Congo in
the 1930s and decided to look for it after it had
attacked a man. According to one account, he
discovered huge tracks and found black hairs in
the hollow of a tree; according to another (per-
haps embellished) account, he actually glimpsed
the animal and obtained three long, white hairs
from the son of the man who found them
clenched in the teeth and under the fingernails
of an Australian photographer killed by the Mu-
lahu sometime during World War I.

Mulilo
Unknown AMPHIBIAN of Central Africa.
Physical description: Black and sluglike.
Length, 6 feet. Width, 12 inches.
Behavior: Appears only when a rainbow is
seen. Its poisonous breath is fatal.
Distribution: Democratic Republic of the
Congo; Zambia.
Possible explanation: An unknown Caecilian
(Order Gymnophiona), a group of wormlike
358 MULAHU
tropical amphibians that burrow through soil
and mud. The largest underground species,
Caecilia thompsoni, lives in Colombia, is nearly
5 feet long, and eats insects, larvae, and earth-
worms. Several species are known from sub-
Saharan Africa.

Multicoiled Sea Monster
A category of Sea MONSTERidentified by Gary
Mangiacopra.
Variant name: Many-coiled sea monster.
Physical description: Serpentine. Large curves
looping in and out of the water. Length,
20-100 feet. Small diameter for its length. Dark
above, whitish below. Square-shaped, seal-like
head, 2 feet in diameter. Some reports place a
horn on the head. Large, bright eyes. Two types
of dorsal fin reported: a continuous fin starting
8 feet in back of the head and single fins on each
loop of the body, about 3-4 feet apart.
Behavior: Swims rapidly by arching its body
out of the water like a snake. Makes a noise like
steam escaping.
Distribution: North Atlantic Ocean.
Significant sightings: On September 22, 1895,
Willard P. Shaw and his family and neighbors
saw a huge snake off their front porch at Spring
Lake, New Jersey. It appeared to be 75-100 feet
long, with its head sticking 6 feet out of the
water. The head was flat, with an alligator-like
snout. It moved about 40 miles an hour by up-
and-down writhing movements.
Professor R. H. Mohr of Boston and his son
were sailing at sunrise on August 10, 1896, off
Nahant, Massachusetts, when they saw a huge,
seal-like head with a foot-long horn projecting
from its forehead. Soon, they saw a series of
loops, each capped by a single fin, circling their
boat. The skin looked like that of a porpoise.
The crew of the ship Livingston sighted a sea
serpent 50 miles north of Frontera, Tabasco
State, Mexico, on June 21, 1908. It was al-
legedly 200 feet long, with a head 6 feet long by
3 feet wide. As it swam away with its tail erect,
observers heard a rattling noise like a Gatling
gun.
Present status: Similar to Bernard Heuvel-
mans’s Multihumped Sea Monster
Possible explanation: An archaic whale, possi-
bly an elongated basilosaurid.

Multifinned Sea Monster
A category of Sea MONSTER identified by
Bernard Heuvelmans.
Scientific name: Cetioscolopendra aeliani, given
by Heuvelmans in 1965.
Variant names: TElian’s sea centipede,
Cetacean centipede, CON Rfj Many-finned sea
monster, TbMPONDRANO.
Physical description: Elongated body with pecu-
liar lateral projections that look like forward-
pointing fins, only four to twelve of which are
usually seen above water. Length, 30-100 feet,
with a probable average of 60-70 feet. Skin is
smooth like tanned leather. Brown with dirty-yel-
low speckles or greenish gray. Covered with large
scales or bony plates that form segmented armor.
Round head, said to look like a walrus, seal, or
calf. Small but prominent eyes, placed high on
the head. Wide mouth like a turtle’s. Visible nos-
trils, surrounded by hairs. Short, slender neck. An
apparent saw-toothed crest along the spine, prob-
ably formed from the body armor. Pectoral flip-
pers sometimes reported. Flat tail, possibly trilo-
bate and only slightly spread horizontally.
Behavior: Seen throughout the year. Swims in
vertical undulations. Turns by rolling to one
side, making its lateral fins visible. Can reach a
speed of 10 knots. Spouting or breath is almost
always seen.
Distribution: Tropical and subtropical waters
worldwide.
Significant sightings: This animal was appar-
ently first described by the Roman rhetorician
TElian of the third century A.D. as a “sea cen-
tipede.”
MULTIFINNED SEA MONSTER 359
On August 28, 1852, Captain Steele and the
Ninth Lancers regiment, on the British ship
Barham in the Mozambique Channel, watched
a green animal with the head and neck of an
enormous snake. Its head was 16-20 feet out of
the water, and it had a huge, saw-shaped crest
down its back. It spouted water a long distance
away from its head.
On July 8, 1856, about 50 miles south of the
Cape of Good Hope, South Africa, Capt. A. R.
N. Tremearne and the crew of the Princess saw
a large fish with a walruslike head and twelve
forward-pointing dorsal fins. Someone fired a
rifle at the animal, hitting it in the head.
Lieutenant Lagresille and the crew of the
gunboat Avalanche observed two 65-foot, undu-
lating animals in Halong Bay, Vietnam, in July
1897. They dived after the crew fired on them.
The Avalanche chased two similar animals for
ninety minutes on February 15, 1898, but they
outpaced the boat. A similar incident occurred
on February 26, when the officers and crew of
the Bayardwtrt also on board. The animals had
seal-like heads and three large bodily coils with
saw-tooth crests.
A monster with an “immense number of fins”
was seen in the Mediterranean by the crew of
the HMS Narcissus off Cape Falcon, Algeria, on
May 21, 1899. It was more than 150 feet long
and swam by means of an “immense” number
of fins on both sides of its body. It spouted
water like a whale from several points.
In July 1920, off the Florida coast between
Miami and Fort Lauderdale, the captain and crew
of the merchant ship Craigsmere watched a large
sea animal with several porpoiselike dorsal fins.
In 1935, Lt. W. C. Hogan of the U.S. Coast
Guard vessel Electra saw a 40- to 50-foot animal
with six fins on its back off the coast of Norfolk,
Virginia. Each fin was 2 feet high and 2 feet 6
inches wide at the base. The crew fired at it un-
successfully.
Possible explanations:
(1) An archaic whale, possibly a
basilosaurid, with heavy, armored scales,
suggested by Bernard Heuvelmans.
However, scales found with these fossil
whales are now known to come from other
animals.
(2) A giant crustacean of an unknown type,
suggested by Karl Shuker, especially for the

Multihumped Sea Monster
A category of S EA MONSTER identified by
Bernard Heuvelmans.
Scientific names: Misnamed Scoliophis atlanti-
cus in 1817, based on confusion with a de-
formed black snake; Plurigibbosus novaeangliae,
given by Heuvelmans in 1965.
Variant names: American sea serpent, CADDY,
Cassie, Dorsal F inner, Multi coiled Sea
MONSTER, Many-humped sea monster.
Physical description: Elongated body, with
many regularly placed humps that form a con-
spicuous ridge along the spine. Length, 60-115
feet. Diameter, 9-15 feet. Dull green to dark
brown or black on top. Throat and underside
pure white. Skin is usually smooth, though
sometimes reported as rough. Scales are occa-
sionally mentioned. Ovoid head, flat on top.
Large eyes, 6 inches in diameter. Broad snout
like an ox’s. Slender neck, with one or two white
stripes on the side. Throat and underside are
white. Small, triangular fin sometimes seen on
the shoulder. Single pair of frontal flippers.
Sometimes seen with a straight fin or fan on its
back. Bilobate tail, one lobe of which sometimes
appears at the surface.
Behavior: Usually appears in the summer in
New England and in the spring farther north.
Swims with vertical undulations that resemble a
caterpillar’s motion. Splashes and lashes the

water. Reaches speeds of 22-40 knots. Spouting
not reported.
Distribution: East coast of North America
from New York to Newfoundland, with a pref-
erence prior to the twentieth century for Massa-
chusetts Bay and the Gulf of Maine. Also seen
south of Iceland and west of Scotland; elsewhere
in the Gulf Stream; off British Columbia,
Canada (Caddy); and elsewhere on the Pacific
coast. This animal is very similar to the serpen-
tine, coiled Freshwater Monsters seen in cer-
tain Canadian lakes, especially OGOPOGO and
Manipogo.
Significant sightings: Capt. Elkanah Finney
observed a classic American sea serpent for
about five minutes in Warren Cove near Ply-
mouth, Massachusetts, around June 20, 1815.
It looked like a string of thirty to forty buoys,
with a head about 6-8 feet long. The total
length was 100-120 feet. Finney got up early
the next morning in hopes of seeing it again and
watched it for two hours as it dived repeatedly.
This time, it appeared to be only 20-30 feet
long.
On August 10, 1817, Lydia Wonson watched
a 70-foot sea serpent through a spyglass for
nearly thirty minutes from her home near
Rocky Neck, Gloucester Harbor, Massachu-
setts. It drew itself up in coils that looked like
the buoys of a fishing net. The same day, Amos
Story saw the animal off nearby Ten Pound Is-
land. It carried its turtle-shaped head about a
MULTIHUMPED SEA MONSTER 361
foot above the surface, but he could see only
about 12 feet of the body. Ship’s carpenter
Matthew Gaffney shot at the same sea creature
on August 14, 1817, when it was only 30 feet
away in Gloucester Harbor. It sank down and
went directly under his boat, surfacing 100
yards away. By August 28, hundreds of residents
and tourists had seen one or even two multi-
humped animals, and whale fishermen unsuc-
cessfully tried to harpoon them.
On September 27, 1817, at Loblolly Cove in
Rockport, Massachusetts, Goreham Norwood
and a Mr. Colbey, coming to the aid of Colbey’s
screaming young son, killed a deformed North-
ern black racer ( Coluber constrictor constrictor)
about 3 feet 6 inches long. The Linnean Society
of New England hastily concluded that this was a
juvenile sea serpent and gave it the scientific name
Scoliophis atlanticus (Atlantic humped snake).
James Prince, his family, Samuel Cabot, and
a large crowd of other people watched a 60-foot
sea serpent with thirteen to fifteen humps not
far from the beach at Nahant, Massachusetts,
for more than two hours on the morning of Au-
gust 14, 1819.
On June 17, 1826, Capt. Henry Holdredge
and passengers of the Silas Richards saw a 60-
foot animal swimming 50 yards away from the
ship off Georges Bank, about 134 miles east of
Nantucket, Massachusetts.
On May 15, 1833, Capt. W. Sullivan and
four other members of a Canadian rifle brigade
saw a sea serpent in Mahone Bay, Nova Scotia,
as they were sailing to the fishing grounds. They
described it as a “common snake” about 80 feet
long, with its head elevated and leaving a regu-
lar wake. Its head was about 6 feet long and was
nearly black, irregularly streaked with white.
In August 1845, two observers saw a 100-foot
monster in the Northumberland Strait 200 feet
off Merigomish, Nova Scotia. It appeared to
nearly be run aground, as it got away with diffi-
culty only after thirty minutes. It occasionally
raised its seal-like head out of the water. It had
several protuberances, which one witness
thought were humps and the other thought
were vertical coils. Its skin was black, with a
rough appearance.
The Rev. Arthur Lawrence and others on the
yacht Princess saw a strange creature on July 30,
1875, between Swampscott and Egg Rock,
Massachusetts. Only its head and neck were vis-
ible, but it was distinctly dark above and white
below. It raised its head several times 6-8 feet
out of the water. It had a dorsal fin at the back
of its neck and what appeared to be fins or flip-
pers at the front of its throat. They followed it
for two hours, taking potshots at it.
B. M. Baylis saw an animal with four or five
rounded humps off the coast at Hilston, York-
shire, England, in early August 1945.
On October 16, 1966, George and May Ash-
ton were strolling near the beach at Chapel St.
Leonards, Lincolnshire, England, when they
spotted an animal with six or seven pointed
humps skimming through the water less than
100 yards offshore.
On October 31, 1983, five construction
workers saw a dark, 100-foot animal swimming
toward the cliffs at Stinson Beach, California.
Mark Ratto watched it through binoculars and
said it appeared to be followed by about 100
birds and two dozen sea lions. He saw a head
and neck that “came up to look around” and
three coils or body humps.
Present status : Much rarer in the North At-
lantic since the beginning of the twentieth
century.
Possible explanation: An archaic basilosaurid
whale or another unknown family of early
cetaceans, suggested by Heuvelmans.

Mumulou
LITHE Peop IE of Australasia.
Etymology: Ghari (Austronesian) word.
Variant names: Kakamora (on San Cristobal),
Moka, Mola, Mumu (on Maramasike).
Physical description: Height, 3-4 feet. Fair to
dark skin. Long, straight head-hair down to the
knees. Tiny teeth. Long beard. Long nails.
Behavior: Moves by jumping on its toes. Cry
is a half wail, half bark. Disgusting odor. Said to
be a cannibal. Doesn’t know fire or tools.
Habitat: Caves.
Distribution: Laudari Mountains of Guadal-
canal; Maramasike and San Cristobal in the
Solomon Islands.
Significant sighting: Charles Elliot Fox was
traveling with a party of natives on San Cristo-
bal when one of them saw a Kakamora in a river

Muskox of Noyon Uul
Unknown HOOFED Mamm ALof ancient Central
Asia.
Physical description: Long, dense hair. Broad
head. Horns like a muskox’s. Bull-like muzzle.
Habitat: Mountainous terrain.
Distribution: Mongolia; north-central Siberia.
Significant sightings: Carvings depicting an
animal like a muskox were discovered in 1924
on two silver plaques excavated from Xiongnu
(Hun) burial tombs dating from the first cen-
tury B.G in the Noyon Uul Mountains, Mongo-
lia.
Muskox skulls dating from 1800-900 B.G
were found in 1948 on the Taymyr Peninsula,
Siberia; they appear to have drill holes. Another
subfossil skull was found in 1984 in the same
vicinity.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Muskox ( Ovibos moschatus ), a large
bovid with broad, flat horns and long, silky
hair, is thought to have died out in Eurasia
at the end of the Pleistocene, though it has
survived in North America. Its apparent
persistence nearly 8,000 years later has not
been demonstrated conclusively.
(2) Other explanations for the carvings have
included an Argali wild sheep ( Ovis
ammori), a Yak [Bos grunniens), and a Takin
(. Budorcas taxicolor).

Southeast Asia.
Etymology: Sanskrit (Indo-Aryan), “serpent.”
The term was also used for followers of serpent
cults in India, particularly the pre-Hindu
Nagas, who spoke a Sino-Tibetan language that
is still found in Nagaland, Manipur, and eastern
Assam States in India.
Variant names: Lu (Sino-Tibetan), Nagini
(for the female), Nat (in Myanmar), Naya.
Physical description: Length, up to 59 feet.
Black. Carries a jewel in its head.
Habitat: Caves, under the sea, or in an un-
derground kingdom called Naga-loka or Patala-
loka.
Distribution: Thailand; India.
Significant sighting: The abbot of a monastery
near Phon Phisai, Thailand, is said to have seen
a large, black, scaly snake with an erectile crest
on its head.
Present status: As symbols of fertility, images
of Nagas adorn houses, shrines, and temples in
India.
Possible explanation: A mystical, semidivine
being based on the King cobra ( Ophiophagus
hannah ), which can grow to 18 feet long, weigh
up to 20 pounds, and is so venomous that it can
kill an elephant. It can rear up to one-third of its
total body length.

Nahuel Huapi Pterosaur
Flying Reptile of South America.
Physical description: Leathery skin. Pelican-like.
Habitat: Caves.
Distribution: Lago Nahuel Huapi, Neuquen
Province, Argentina.
Significant sightings: In the nineteenth cen-
tury, two hunters named Milacsek and Shirdos
shot a pelican-like bird or reptile with leathery
skin that flew away from a cave at Lago Nahuel
Huapi, Argentina. Ulrich Dunkel claims the
animal was left with the National Museum
of Natural History in Santiago, Chile (founded
in 1830), but was lost during one of the civil
wars that Chile went through (in 1829-1830,
1851, 1859, 1891). Hans Krieg says only the
head was retrieved, it was discarded after three
days, and it belonged to a Flying steamerduck
( Tachyeres patachonicus ), though this bird is
hardly pelican-like.

Nahuelito
Freshwater Monster of Argentina.
Etymology: Spanish, “Little Nahuel,” after the
lake.
Variant name: PATAGONIAN PLESIOSAUR.
Physical description: Length, 15-20 feet.
Rough skin. Head like a snake’s. Neck, 9 feet
long. Multiple humps.
Behavior: Surfaces only when the lake is calm.

Distribution: Lago Nahuel Huapi, Neuquen
Province, Argentina.
365
Significant sightings: In 1910, George Garrett
and his son had a brief look at an animal 1 5-20
feet long as they were sailing along a narrow
inlet of Nahuel Huapi.
Sra. Rumboll saw the long neck of an animal
leaving a wake on February 16, 1978.
Jessica Campbell and others observed an ani-
mal with multiple humps swimming in the lake
on January 1, 1994. Two years later, Campbell
saw the animal twice in one afternoon, once
when it swam directly toward her as she sat on
some rocks.

Naitaka
Freshwater Monsters of Canada, including
Ogopogo.
Etymology: Okanagan (Salishan), “lake
demon.”
Variant names: Na-ha-ha-itkh, Na-ha-ha-
itque (“snake in the water”), N’ha-a-itk, N’ha-
ha-itq, N’hahtik, N’haw-hetq.
Behavior: Churns the water into a fury.
Distribution: British Columbia; Saskatche-
wan; Manitoba.
Possible explanations: The legend may be par-
tially based on fossil bones. In the 1930s, a huge
Naitaka bone was found on the shore of Lake
Winnipegosis, Manitoba, by Oscar Frederick-
son. Though the original was lost in a fire, a
wooden model of it had been made, and this
model was examined in 1960 by zoologist James
A. McLeod. He concluded the bone was most
likely the vertebra from some large reptile.

Significant sightings: Paul Peters watched a
Bushman along the Yukon River near Ruby,
Alaska, in the fall of 1960. It was walking along
the rocky beach toward his dogs, which were
whining and acting strangely. The Bushman
was very muscular, covered in black hair, and
about 6 feet 6 inches tall.
366 NAITAKA
John Baptist saw a manlike creature with a
long, dark beard near Fort Liard, Northwest Ter-
ritories, in April 1964. It uttered a wild growl and
fled, leaving tracks. The following month, an In-
dian woman saw the same wild man, and in June
outside Fort Simpson, a fourteen-year-old boy
and his father saw a small, dark creature with a
long beard who carried a stone club and wore a
piece of moose skin around his waist.
Patty Nollnar and six other villagers of Nu-
lato, Alaska, encountered a Bushman in 1970
along the Koyukuk River, about 20 miles north
of its confluence with the Yukon. They didn’t
see it, but it threw a rock at them as they were
resting around their campfire.

Namibian Flying Snake
Flying Reptile of South Africa.
Variant name: Noya a thaba.
Physical description: Length, 9-25 feet. Yel-
low, black, or brown with light spots. Rumored
to change colors like a chameleon. Large head,
with a luminous or reflective spot on a caplike
structure. May also have a pair of backward-
curving horns. Inflated neck. Batlike wings.
Wingspan, 30 feet.
Behavior: Hurls itself down hills, making a
loud roaring sound. Said to be capable of sus-
tained flight, not only gliding. Smells like tar or
“burned brass.”
Tracks: Serpentine, showing the marks of
scales.
Distribution: Karas Region, Namibia; Drak-
ensberg, South Africa.
Significant sightings: In January 1942, Michael
Esterhuise was tending sheep near Keetman-
NAMIBIAN FLYING SNAKE 367
shoop, Namibia, when he saw a large snake
launch itself down a rocky ledge into his flock.
He encountered the snake on two later occasions.
Marcus Oarum ran into a snake gliding down
the Drakensberg Mountains in 1985.
Possible explanations:
(1) Unknown African species of Golden tree
snake ( Chrysopelea ornata ), a colubrid snake
of Southeast Asia that jumps from tree to
tree by gliding.
(2) Alleged skulls of this flying snake found
in 1988 turned out to be the pelvic bones of
Ostriches ( Struthio camelus).

hair. Massive chest.
Distribution: Loita Hills, east of Lolgorien,
southern Kenya.
Present status: Possibly corresponds with one
of the unknown Kenyan cryptids designated as

Nandi Bear
A ferocious mystery animal of East Africa, vari-
ously described as a PRIMATE, a HYENA, or a
Bear.
Etymology: Named after the Nandi people, a
Kalenjin-speaking group who live in the area
around Kapsabet in Kenya’s Rift Valley, where
the animal has been widely reported. One of the
first sightings by a European was made by Geof-
frey Williams, who compared the creature he
saw to a bear. The animals reported in subse-
quent descriptions were much less bearlike.
Variant names: Booaa, Chemisit, Duba
(Swahili/Bantu, along the Kenya coast, derived
from the Arabic dubb, “bear”), Engargiyar
(Ganda/Bantu), GETEIT, Giant forest hyena,
Kabiniro (Tooro/Bantu) , KHODUMODUMO,
Kichwa mutwe (Masaba/Bantu), KODDOELO,
Mubende beast, Ngargiya (Ganda or Nyankore/
Bantu), Ntebagarnyar (Nyore/ Bantu), Rwuji-
gar (in Bugoma Forest), Sabrookoo (Gisu/
Bantu or Kupsabiny/Nilo-Saharan), Shivuverre
(Luyia/Bantu), Too.
Physical description: The two major cryptids
involved here seem to be a large, baboonlike
beast and a hyena-like creature. Baboonlike an-
imal — Thickset. Height, 4-5 feet when stand-
ing upright. Shoulder height, 3 feet 6 inches-4
feet 6 inches. Dark brown or tawny color.
Shaggy, long hair. Long head. Small ears.
368 NAMPESHIU
Stumpy nose. Pointed snout. Short neck. Front
and legs thickly furred but hindquarters rela-
tively bare. High withers. Sloping back. Planti-
grade feet. Tail is small or nonexistent. Hyena-
like animal — Twice the size of a Spotted hyena
( Crocuta crocuta). Shaggy, brown hair. Short
head. Red eyes. Small ears. Large teeth. Long
mane. Back slopes to the rear. Long forelegs,
shorter hind legs. Digitigrade feet. Short tail.
Behavior: Nocturnal. Sits on its haunches.
Can stand on its hind legs. Can climb or leap
over tall fences. Runs on all fours with a side-
ways canter or a loping, shambling gait. Call is
a terrifying howl or moaning cry. Said to tear
open the heads of livestock to feed on the brains
and to attack solitary humans in a similar way.
Also said to force its way into native huts at
night, kill the occupants, and eat their brains.
Tracks: Baboonlike animal — Oblong.
Length, 5.5 inches. Width, 3.5 inches. Five-
toed, with claws. Plantigrade. Hyena-like ani-
mal — Larger than a man’s. Spade-shaped.
Three-toed, with huge, inward-turning claws
and pads. Digitigrade.
Distribution: Uganda; the highlands of west-
ern Kenya; southern Kenya to the coast. Said by
the Nandi to have been more common before
the rinderpest epidemic at the end of the nine-
teenth century.
Significant sightings: Around 1905, Geoffrey
Williams briefly encountered a strange creature
while he was on safari near Sergoit Rock on the
Uasin Gishu tableland of western Kenya. It was
less than 30 yards away, sitting on its haunches
like a zoo bear. Nearly 5 feet high, the animal
had a long head and small, pointed ears. It
shambled away in a sideways canter.
In 1912, a Major Toulson observed a long-
haired, black beast on the Uasin Gishu that had
just attempted to raid his camp’s kitchen. It ran
with a shuffling walk and stood about 18-20
inches tall at the shoulder. Others said it was
thickset, chased off dogs, and had a peculiar,
moaning cry.
Railroad engineer G. W. Hickes observed a
shaggy-haired, hyena-like animal on the Magadi
Railway in southern Kenya on March 8, 1913.
He got a good look at it from 50 yards away and
realized it was no ordinary hyena.
About 1914, one of these animals was killed
near Kap sowar, Kenya, by villagers who tricked
it into attacking a dummy man in the doorway
of a hut. They then shot it with arrows.
In 1925, government agent William Hichens
went to investigate the animal’s depredations in
a Kenya village. His tent was attacked at night
by something that gave out a horrifying roar and
carried off his pet dog.
Charles T. Stoneham woke up one night at
his trading station in Sotik, Kenya, and saw a
lion-sized animal with a square head, a pig’s
snout, large circular ears, and a thick tail. He ran
indoors to get his rifle, but the creature was run-
ning away when he returned. Stoneham’s
friends thought he had seen a Nandi bear, but
he thought it might have been a hybrid anteater.
One night in the early 1930s, Capt. F. D.
Hislop, district commissioner of Kapsabet,
Kenya, saw a bearlike animal 3 feet high at the
shoulder and with a small pointed head. It ran
off on all four legs.
In the early 1930s, Gunnar Anderssen re-
ported to the Kenya Game Department that an
unknown animal had killed a forest pig at
Kaimosi, Kenya. He hadn’t seen it, but the
Nandi villagers said it had long, black hair and
a long tail. Anderssen found a few ambiguous,
leopardlike tracks nearby.
Douglas Hutton shot two animals at the
Chemomi Tea Estate, Kenya, in 1957 or 1958.
They stood 3 feet high at the shoulder, had rear-
ward-sloping backs, and heavy manes. The
Nairobi Museum identified them as “giant for-
est hyenas.” A similar animal was seen in the
same area in July 1981.
Present status: Though commonly reported in
East Africa from 1905 to 1935, only a few sight-
ings have occurred since.
Possible explanations: Most likely, the Nandi
bear is a composite of various cryptids and
misidentified animals.
(1) Except for the Atlas Bear, no bears are
currently known to exist anywhere in Africa.
There is some fossil evidence, however, for
agriotheriine bears in Africa during the
Miocene, 10 million years ago, and more
advanced ursids in South Africa as early as
the Pliocene, 4 million years ago.
NANDI BEAR 369
(2) An oversized, all-black Ratel (. Mellivora
capensis). This lumbering, black-and-white
badger grows to about 2 feet 6 inches long
(with a 1-foot tail) and will occasionally raid
small livestock. All-black animals have
occasionally been reported, while others
have only a narrow band of white. Bernard
Heuvelmans attributes several sightings
(Toulson’s, Hislop’s, and Anderssen’s) to a
melanistic ratel. Its plantigrade feet make
composite, oblong tracks.
(3) A Spotted hyena ( Crocuta crocuta ) of
unusual color or size. Though primarily a
timid scavenger, it will kill slower mammals
for food and is occasionally a bold attacker.
This hyena grows to 5 feet 1 0 inches in
length, with a 2-foot tail. Reginald Pocock
suggests a red variation as the source of
Nandi bear reports. In 1929, the skin of a
young female Sabrookoo killed at an
altitude of 8,000 feet in Uganda near
Mount Elgon was examined by Charles
Pitman. Its fur was blackish-brown dabbled
with white, and it had a coarse, pale mane.
He identified it as an aberrant spotted
hyena with dark coloration. A stray or
escaped Brown hyena ( Hyaena brunnea ),
normally found only in South Africa, might
also have played a part in the Nandi bear
legend.
(4) An Aardvark ( Orycteropus afer ),
suggested by Bernard Heuvelmans for
Charles Stoneham’s sighting. This animal
has a pig’s snout, huge ears, coarse brown
hair, and a powerful tail. Its footprints may
also have caused confusion; when it stands
on its hind legs, it puts its sole flat on the
ground and leaves a five-toed print with
deep claw marks. However, it only eats ants
and termites.
(5) An unknown anthropoid ape, though
apes are largely herbivorous and timid and
thus do not fit the alleged ferocity of the
Nandi bear. However, there have been
reports of unknown PRIMATES and GlANT
HOMINIDS, such as the GERIT in Kenya,
that might contribute to the legend.
(6) Baboons have the temperament for
violent attacks, but the male Savanna
baboon ( Papio cynocephalus) of East Africa is
not much more than 3 feet 3 inches long
and less than 2 feet at the shoulder. The
Olive baboon ( P . anubis) is larger, with a
maximum length of 3 feet 8 inches and a
shoulder height of 2 feet 4 inches. The
Chacma baboon (P. ursinus) of South Africa
and the Gelada ( Theropithecus gelada ) of
Ethiopia are a bit smaller. The Mandrill
(. Mandrillus sphinx) of Gabon grows to 3
feet 4 inches long and a shoulder height of
2 feet, but its distinctive coloration would
betray it. The Nandi bear is at least a third
larger than any of these.
(7) A surviving Giant baboon ( Theropithecus
oswaldi ), an ancestor of the gelada that lived
in Kenya 4 million-650,000 years ago. The
male was roughly the size of a female gorilla
and weighed 250 pounds. It was too big to
live in trees and could not use its long
forearms for swinging. Early Paleolithic
peoples may have hunted it to extinction.
Another candidate might be the large fossil
baboon, Dinopithecus ingens, discovered by
Robert Broom in South Africa in the 1930s.
It lived 3-1.5 million years ago and is
possibly related to the ancestors of the
mandrill.
(8) A surviving Short-faced hyena
(P achy crocuta brevirostris) , a lion-sized
carnivore that lived in Southern Europe and
West Asia during the Middle Pleistocene. It
had a short muzzle, strongly built jaws, and
massive teeth, making its profile more
bearlike than that of modern hyenas. Karl
Shuker thinks this active predator would
make an excellent Nandi bear.
(9) A surviving chalicothere, a member of a
family of fossil ungulates that lived 45
million years ago, in the Eocene, and
survived in East Africa until 12,000 years
ago. These animals were horselike mammals
with large retractile claws instead of hooves,
long necks, rearward-sloping backs, and
elongated front limbs that were much longer
than the hind legs. They browsed on tree
leaves and probably knuckle-walked like a
gorilla, with claws curled inward. Evidence
that a chalicothere may have survived into
370 NANDI BEAR
historical times comes from a Saka
(Scythian) tomb in Siberia (500-400 B.C.),
where two gold belt plaques were found that
show a horselike animal with clawed feet.
(10) The African civet ( Civettictis civetta ) is
found in Kenya. A shaggy, blotched and
banded, doglike nocturnal animal, the civet
grows to about 3 feet long and has a
shortish, ringed tail. Normally silent, it
growls when cornered or surprised, and its
hair stands erect.
(11) The heavily built Giant forest hog
(. Hylochoerus meinertzh agent) might
acccount for the Rwujigar of the Bugoma
Forest. Charles Pitman said this animal was
more plentiful in Kenya during the
nineteenth century.
(12) The African wild dog ( Lycaon pictus)
ranges through parts of Kenya. It has a
black muzzle and a blotchy coat. Some of
the names given in Uganda for this dog also
refer to a Nandi bear-like animal (Ipen and
Mushegga).
(13) Murders committed by secret societies
or terrorists could have been doctored to
make it look as if a huge, mysterious animal
was responsible.
(14) The mystery cat MNGWA, known from
the same area, might account for livestock
depredations, while actual sightings of the
Nandi bear could be attributed to hyenas,
ratels, and baboons.

Nayarit Ruffed Cat
Unknown Cat of Mexico.
Physical description: Length, 4 feet 6 inches.
Varying shades of brown. Dark stripes on flanks
and upper legs. Lower limbs are dark brown to
black. No facial markings. Large neck ruff that
covers the ears. Long legs. Large, well-furred
paws. Bright yellow, retractile claws. Tail, 18
inches long.
Distribution: Sierra de Nayarit, Mexico.
Significant sightings: In 1940, Ivan Sanderson
purchased two skins of this odd-looking cat in a
mountain village in Nayarit State, Mexico, but
they were later lost in a flood. He had seen an-
other skin for sale in Colima the same year.

Ndalawo
Dark Leopard of East Africa.
Variant name: Ondurlarwo (in northwest
Uganda).
Physical description: Size and shape of a leop-
ard. Black fur on its back, gray on the flanks.
Behavior: Three or four of these animals hunt
together. They utter a hyena-like laugh when
hunting. Said to attack and kill humans.
Habitat: Forests.
Distribution: Uganda.
Possible explanation: The pseudomelanistic
Leopard ( Panthera pardus var. melanotica) is a
rare morph, but the coloration is similar.

Ndendeki
Giant Turtle of Central Africa.
Etymology: Probably Lingala (Bantu) word.
Variant name: Ndendecki.
Physical description: Rounded shell, 12-15
feet in diameter.
Behavior: Aquatic. Feeds on organic matter.
Distribution: Likouala aux Herbes River, Re-
public of the Congo.
Possible explanation: The African softshell tur-
tle ( Trionyx triunguis) reaches a length of 3 feet
(possibly as much as 6 feet) and has an elon-
gated snout. It is found in ponds, lakes, and
rivers from Egypt to West Africa. Allowing for
witness exaggeration, older outsize specimens
could account for the Ndendeki tradition, ac-
cording to Marcellin Agnagna and Roy Mackal.

Nebraska Man
Supposed fossil PRIMATE of North America.
Scientific name : Hesperopithecus haroldcookii,
given by Henry Fairfield Osborn in 1922.
Significant sighting: In 1917, rancher and ge-
ologist Harold Cook discovered a fossil tooth,
apparently an upper molar, in Miocene deposits
near Agate, Nebraska. He submitted it in March
1922 to Henry Fairfield Osborn, a distin-
guished paleontologist at the American Mu-
seum of Natural History, who announced it as
the first anthropoid ape fossil discovered in the
Americas.
Present status : In 1 927, after a few other sci-
entists had tentatively accepted it, the tooth was
properly identified as belonging to a fossil pec-
cary (. Prosthennops crassigenus ) .

Nefllim
Giant Hominids of West Asia.
Etymology: From the Hebrew (Semitic) root
nfl (“to fall”), so it could mean “those who fell
or were cast down.” Traditionally translated as
“giants” because the adjacent text mentions men
of great stature.
Variant name: Nephilim.
Significant sighting: According to the Bible,
the Nefilim were on Earth when the sons of
God went to the daughters of men and had chil-
dren by them.
Possible explanations: Despite much specula-
tion, no one really knows what the name Ne-
filim refers to. Among the guesses are: the abo-
riginal inhabitants of Palestine, mysterious he-
roes or princes of old, men of great size, fallen
angels, the sons of Seth who sinned by marrying
pagan women, and extraterrestrials who “fell”
from the sky in a spacecraft.

Nellie the Lion
Eastern Puma of Illinois.
Physical description: Large cat. Tawny or yel-
lowish.
Behavior: Attacks humans and cars. Can leap
20 feet.
Tracks: Catlike, 5 inches long and 4 inches
wide. Some show claw marks.
Distribution: Area around Decatur, Illinois.
Significant sightings: On July 13, 1917, a large
cat attacked butler Thomas Gullett while he was
picking flowers on the Robert Allerton estate
southwest of Monticello, Illinois. The incident
sparked a lion hunt that lasted through the end
of the month.
On the night of July 29, 1917, the cat leaped
at and struck a car occupied by Earl Hill,
Chester Osborn, and their wives on the Spring-
field Road. It was stunned but left when Hill re-
turned with the police.

Neo-Giant
Term coined by Ivan T. Sanderson for GlANT
Hominids, including the Dzu-Teh, Bigfoot,
Sisemite, and Mapinguari. Neo-giant is also
the name used by Mark A. Hall to distinguish
Bigfoot from the Shorter Hominid, the
Taller Hominid, and the True Giant.
Physical description: Average height, 7 feet.
Tracks: Length, 10-20 inches. Width, 3-9
NEO-GIANT 373
inches. Has an hourglass shape. Toes are
roughly the same size. The ball behind the big
toe is split. The toes are positioned obliquely on
the foot, slanting from big toe to small toe. In
the female, the toes are smaller and the heel is
rounder.
Possible explanations: Ivan Sanderson consid-
ered a surviving Gigantopithecus the most likely
candidate, while Hall thought a robust australo-
pith such as Paranthropus more likely. These
and other possible explanations are considered
under the BlGFOOT entry.

Nepalese Tree Bear
Unknown Bear of Central Asia.
Scientific names: Selenarctos arboreus, given by
Thomas Oldham in 1869; Ursus nepalensis,
given by Daniel Taylor-Ide in 1983.
Variant name: Rukh balu (Nepali/Indo-
Aryan, “tree bear”).
Physical description: Weight, about 150
pounds. Black fur. The premolars and first two
molars are smaller than the Asiatic black bear’s.
Behavior: Primarily arboreal. Eats ripe corn at
the end of the monsoon season. Constructs
elaborate, complex tree nests.
Tracks: Has a claw on the side of its paw.
Habitat: Forested valleys.
Distribution: Makalu-Barun National Park in
eastern Nepal.
Significant sighting: In 1983 and 1984,
Daniel Taylor-Ide and Robert L. Fleming gath-
ered reports from villagers in the Barun Valley
that two different types of bear lived in the area:
the Asiatic black bear and a smaller, more agile,
arboreal variety. Eleven skulls were collected.
Present status: More comparisons with Asiatic
black bear specimens are needed to establish a
distinction.
Possible explanations:
(1) A juvenile Asiatic black bear ( Ursus
thibetanus).
(2) A separate species or a subspecies of the
Asiatic black bear.

Nereid
Female MERBEING of Southern Europe.
Etymology: From the Greek Nereis, “daughter
of Nereus.”
Variant names: Amphitrite, Neraid, Ner-
aidhe, Oceanid (an Atlantic variety).
Physical description: Beautiful woman. Green
or golden hair. Not fish- tailed.
Behavior: Aquatic. Enjoys dancing and
singing. Sometimes portrayed as riding on a
dolphin or sea horse. Lascivious. Said to marry a
human occasionally or to abduct children. Able
to change into a fish or other animals.
Distribution: North Atlantic coast; eastern
Mediterranean seacoast of Greece and Turkey.
Khios, the area around Mina, and the Gulf of
Argolis were said to be favorite spots.
Significant sightings: In ancient Greece and
Rome, the creature was primarily described as a
nymph of the sea, rivers, and streams. The gov-
ernor of Gaul reported to the Emperor Augus-
tus (27 B.C.-A.D. 14) that there had been a mass
stranding of Nereids on the Atlantic coast.
In the nineteenth century, the Nereid per-
sisted in folklore, and descriptions expanded its
habitat into forests and mountains.
Possible explanations:
(1) There is evidence that the Dugong
(Dugong dugori) was present in the eastern
Mediterranean, the Red Sea, and the
Persian Gulf in early antiquity, where it
may have influenced Greek beliefs in
humanlike sea creatures.
374 NEPALESE TREE BEAR
(2) Mass strandings of whales or seals along
the Atlantic coast may have inspired stories
of beached Nereids.

Nesophontid Insectivores
INSECTIVORES of the West Indies, presumed ex-
tinct since the seventeenth century.
Scientific name: Family Nesophontidae.
Known species include the Atalaye nesophontes
( Nesophontes hypomicrus ), the Greater Cuban
nesophontes (N. major ), the Haitian ne-
sophontes (N. zamicrus ), the Lesser Cuban ne-
sophontes (N. submicrus ), the Puerto Rican ne-
sophontes (N. edithae ), the St. Michel
nesophontes (N. paramicrus ), the Slender
Cuban nesophontes (N. longirostrih , and the
Western Cuban nesophontes (N. micrus).
Physical description: Size of a mouse or rat.
Long snout.
Distribution: Cuba; Haiti; Puerto Rico.
Present status: Fresh bone and tissue samples
taken from barn owl pellets in Haiti in 1930
suggest a recent survival. The introduction of
rodents and habitat destruction undoubtedly
contributed to their demise.

Nessie
Freshwater Monster of Loch Ness, Scotland.
Etymology: From the Gaelic an Niseag, a fem-
inine diminutive derived from the name of the
loch. It probably originated with the 1933
sightings. The term Loch Ness monster may first
have been used by Evan Barron, editor of the In-
verness Courier, in a May 2, 1933, story.
Scientific name: Nessiteras rhomb opteryx , given
by Peter Scott and Robert Rines in 1975 and
based on the underwater photographs of 1972
and 1975. The name means “the Ness wonder
with the diamond-shaped fin.”
Variant names: Bobby, Lady of the lake, Loch
Ness monster, an Niseag.
Physical description: The most common de-
scriptions mention a large, rounded object like
an overturned boat; several humps in a line; or a
long neck and a hump. Overall length, 10—45
feet. The color is gray, dark gray, or black; occa-
sionally, a sandy or light color is reported. Skin
is mottled and rough like an elephant’s. Under-
parts are sometimes described as white. Small,
flat head that blends into the neck. Two horn-
like protrusions on the top of the head. Oval
eyes. Neck, 4-8 feet long. Usually one to three
humps, sometimes up to eight. Sightings on
land suggest the creature has four short, thick
flippers. Tail, 5-6 feet long with a rounded end.
Behavior: Sightings of two or more animals at
the same time are rare. Usually swims smoothly
with no undulations but at other times with a
zigzag motion. Often moves against wind cur-
rents or travels just below the surface of the
water, creating a V-shaped wake. Sometimes
lashes the water energetically. Can sink perpen-
dicularly. Most active in the daytime. Occasion-
ally seen on land, where it moves awkwardly.
Presumably eats fishes.
Distribution: Loch Ness, Highland, Scotland,
the largest freshwater lake in Great Britain. In-
vestigations are hampered by the fact that the
water is darkened by suspended peat particles
brought in by many brooks. Visibility is reduced
to only a few tens of feet, even with the aid of
powerful underwater strobe lights.
Significant sightings: The Irish missionary St.
Columba is said to have been the first to see
Nessie, in about A.D. 580 when he exorcised a

WATER Horse near the mouth of the River
Ness.
D. MacKenzie of Balhain was standing on a
rock off Abriachan in October 1871 or 1872
when he saw an object like an overturned boat
churning water and moving across the loch
from Aldourie.
Margaret Cameron and three siblings saw a
20-foot monster move from the trees into the
water at Inchnacardoch Bay in 1919. It had two
short, round feet and moved like a caterpillar.
Alfred Cruickshank was driving along the
loch in his Model-T Ford in April 1923 when
he saw a large, humped body standing about 6
feet high roughly 50 yards ahead of him. It had
four legs as thick as an elephant’s and large
webbed feet. The animal barked sharply before
it slipped into the water.
One of the earliest modern sightings took
place in March 1933 when John Mackay and
his wife saw a commotion in the water at the
northern tip of the loch. A large, black body
with two humps seemed to be swimming with a
forward rolling motion.
George F. T. Spicer and his wife saw Nessie
cross the road in front of them as they were driv-
ing between Dores and Foyers on the afternoon
of July 22, 1933. It had a long neck about 6-8
feet long and a high back, with a total length of
about 25 feet.
Br. Richard Horan of St. Benedict’s Abbey,
Fort Augustus, watched a head and neck mov-
ing about slowly for five minutes on May 26,
1934. Apparently disturbed by a rowboat, the
creature submerged and moved off to the north-
east, leaving a wake.
Sir Edward Mountain launched the first or-
ganized surveillance of the loch for five weeks in
July and August 1934. Twenty unemployed
men stood watch five days a week and generated
eleven sightings and several photographs, most
of which depicted boat wakes or wave effects.

As many as fifty people watched an animal
with a small head, long neck, and two black
humps for thirteen minutes near Urquhart Cas-
tle on October 28, 1936. A local man, Duncan
MacMillan, saw it first, but passengers in two
tour buses and several other cars soon stopped
to look.
On April 4, 1947, J. W. McKillop, chief ad-
ministrative officer of the Inverness County
Council, was driving with three other men near
Drumnadrochit when they saw a large head and
neck creating a wake in the water. The sighting
was independently confirmed by another party
of motorists who saw a long, dark form moving
slowly in the loch.
Greta Finlay and her son Harry saw a
humped animal rise out of the water 60 feet
away at Aldourie Point on August 20, 1952.
The head had two 6-inch-long projections on its
end and rose about 2 feet out of the water.
Christine Fraser was one of a busload of
tourists who saw a 25-foot animal with three
humps near Strone on October 8, 1957. The
middle hump was moving back and forth with
incredible speed.
On August 25, 1962, writer F. W. “Ted”
Holiday saw a blackish-gray creature, 40-45
feet long, moving to and fro near the mouth of
the River Foyers.
In 1967, biochemist Roy Mackal became
convinced of Nessie’s reality after an 8-foot back
surfaced next to the boat in which he was ser-
vicing investigative hydrophones. On one side,
he saw the tip of a left pectoral flipper.
In October 1969, Dan Scott Taylor Jr. pi-
loted a personally built, 2-ton, yellow minisub,
the Viperfish , on several dives to the bottom of
the loch. On one occasion, he was bumped by a
solid object that took off at 16 knots, faster than
the sub could go.
In September 1970, in the boat Fussy Hen,
Roy Mackal, Robert Love, and Jeff Blonder saw
NESSIE 377
In 1934, Arthur Grant saw Nessie while he was riding
his motorcycle on the road alongside the loch. (William
M. Rebsamen/Fortean Picture Library)
a black object rise up in Urquhart Bay, appar-
ently the back and flipper of a large animal.
On June 23, 1971, Robert H. Rines and his
wife, Carol, watched a 20-foot-long hump mov-
ing in Urquhart Bay.
The most recent sighting on land occurred on
July 8, 1979, near Foyers. Donald MacKinnon
saw a gray animal about 24 feet long emerge
from the woods, walk down to the loch, and
slide into the water. He clearly saw four feet
with three digits each.
On July 21, 1987, Barbara Grant and Mary
Appleby saw a reddish-brown, pillarlike object
sticking out of the loch north of the Abriachan
turnoff. Grant stopped the car and looked
again, but this time, the women saw a dark ob-
ject moving at considerable speed.
Edna Maclnnes and David Mackay saw a
dark-brown animal with a giraffelike head and
neck swimming around for about ten minutes
on June 17, 1993.
For a few minutes on April 24, 1999, Dave
Turner and a friend watched, from the Inver-
farigaig nature trail, an underwater object with
four limbs that moved slowly and jerkily.
Photography : Hugh Gray took the first photo
of Nessie, near Foyers on November 12, 1933.
It shows a large body causing a disturbance in
the water. Gray could not see the head, which
was apparently under water.
Malcolm Irvine allegedly made the first film
of Nessie, on December 12, 1933, but his cam-
era jammed, and he only obtained a few seconds
of footage. Unfortunately, that footage cannot
now be located.
The “surgeon’s photo” was supposedly taken
by gynecologist Lt. Col. R. Kenneth Wilson on
April 1, 1934. It was long thought genuine, but
in the 1990s, there were claims it was faked by
Christian Spurling and Marmaduke A.
Wetherell using a toy, self-propelled, tin subma-
rine with a wooden head and neck attached to
the conning tower. Though the hoax story has
been questioned, the photo itself has little evi-
dential value. A second photo taken shortly af-
terward seems to have been shot at another angle
under different surface conditions. The Project
Urquhart investigation in 1993 enhanced the
image and discovered a separate object that
seems to be pulling a fake monster behind it.
In Urquhart Bay on September 15, 1934,
James Fraser took some footage of Nessie with a
16-millimeter movie camera fitted with a tele-
photo lens. The film was shown at the annual
meeting of the Linnean Society of London,
where it was variously identified as a seal, a
whale, and an otter. Maurice Burton examined
five stills from this now lost film, one of which
he thought showed an anomalous object about
12 feet long and roughly 150 yards from the
shore.
Malcolm Irvine took a second film of an ani-
mal in the loch opposite Urquhart Castle on
September 22, 1936. The 1 -minute sequence
showed a gray, 1 6-foot animal with two humps
moving swiftly across the water. It was shown in
cinemas throughout Britain as newsreel footage,
under the title The Loch Ness Monster: Proof at
Last! Long thought to be lost, the film was re-
discovered in 2001 in the Scottish Screen
Archive.
G. E. Taylor shot the first color film of
Nessie, opposite Foyers on May 29, 1938. The
animal’s neck dipped up and down, and a
roundish body showed about 1 foot above the
water. The three minutes of footage were exam-
ined by scientists at the National Institute of
Oceanography (now the Southampton Oceano-
graphic Centre), who concluded that the object
was a dead horse or cow bobbing in the water.
Roy Mackal thinks it was a live animal feeding
on fish.
378 NESSIE
On July 14, 1951, a Forestry Commission
worker named Lachlan Stuart snapped a photo
of Nessie at Whitefield. It clearly shows three
humps and was rushed into print the next day
by the Sunday Express (Inverness). In the late
1980s, author Richard Frere revealed that Stuart
had admitted to him at the time that the image
actually shows three partially submerged bales of
hay covered with tarpaulins.
On July 29, 1955, bank manager Peter A.
McNab took two photographs of an elongated
animal off Urquhart Castle. Only one has sur-
vived. Some believe it shows a standing wave
from a boat wake.
Aeronautical engineer Tim Dinsdale filmed a
zigzagging, mahogany-colored object in Foyers
Bay on April 23, 1960, using a Bolex camera. As
a comparison, he afterward filmed a boat mov-
ing in the same direction. In 1966, the film was
examined by the Royal Air Force Joint Air Re-
connaissance Intelligence Centre (JARIC),
which confirmed that the sequence showed an
“animate object” 12-16 feet long. The Project
Urquhart investigation enhanced the film in
1993 and discovered a shadow behind and be-
neath the head; a closer examination seemed to
show a body shape similar to that of a ple-
siosaur. However, some researchers are con-
vinced the footage shows a fishing boat.
Early on the morning of May 27, 1960, Peter
O’Connor snapped a photo of Nessie while he
was camped near Foyers. The photo shows
something shaped like an overturned boat, with
a short, cylindrical neck. A few weeks later,
Maurice Burton found some plastic sacks and
string at the site, leading him to believe the
photo was a hoax.
From 1962 to 1972, the Loch Ness Phenom-
ena Investigation Bureau (LNPIB) — founded
by David James, Constance Whyte, Richard
Fitter, and Sir Peter Scott and overseen by Tim
Dinsdale — monitored long-range surveillance
cameras at strategic points along the loch; sev-
eral lengths of footage were taken, but the mon-
itoring effort was largely unsuccessful. On June
6, 1963, three separate films were shot by
LNPIB watchers; the first apparently shows a
water disturbance caused by ducks, but the oth-
ers are more difficult to explain. One features a
dark, cylindical object, and the other shows a
dome-shaped object traveling swiftly through
the water.
On June 13, 1967, Dick Raynor took a short
sequence of 35-millimeter, black-and-white
film showing a V-shaped wake moving out of
Dores Bay. The movement ceased when the
passenger boat Scott II passed within the frame.
JARIC also analyzed this film and detected a 7-
foot object breaking the surface. However,
Raynor now thinks the picture shows a flock of
birds.
On August 8, 1972, underwater footage was
taken in Urquhart Bay near Temple Pier by a
team headed by Robert H. Rines from the
Academy of Applied Science of Belmont, Mass-
achusetts. The film, taken from an underwater
camera suspended from Rines’s boat, the Nan ,
corresponds to a Raytheon sonar tracking (de-
ployed on another boat, the Narwhal) of a large
object that seemed to be chasing fishes. Two
frames show a roughly triangular (rhomboid)
flipper or fin against a rough body, while a third
shows two blobs. The flipper images became
clearly visible only after digital enhancement, re-
sulting in criticisms that the photos were re-
touched. However, the presence of dense peat
particles in the water occludes significant detail
and requires enhancement. Researcher Adrian
Shine thinks the image is a close-up view of a
normal fish. Using a wide variety of photo-
graphic techniques, Nicholas Witchell’s 1993
Project Urquhart investigation was unable to re-
create the exact flipper image from the unen-
hanced photo.
On June 20, 1975, Robert Rines obtained
two more subsurface photographs southeast of
Temple Pier, one showing a “gargoyle” head
with apparent horns and the other revealing the
head, neck, and body of a plesiosaur-like ani-
mal. Many experts dispute that the photos show
Nessie. G. E. Harwood concluded in 1977 that
both images show debris and silt on the loch
bottom. Adrian Shine thinks the full-body shot
might actually show shifting silt patterns and
the gargoyle head could be a tree stump that
scuba diver Dick Raynor photographed and
dredged up in October 1987 during Operation
Deepscan.
NESSIE 379
Photo of Nessie taken by Lachlan Stuart on July 14, 1951. (From a postcard in the author’s collection)
The head-and-neck color photographs taken
by Irish busker and surrealist Tony “Doc” Shiels
from Urquhart Castle on May 21, 1977, are
probably double exposures or superimpositions.
A surprisingly similar photo was taken in Sep-
tember 1983 south of Achnahannet by an
anonymous woman.
On August 22, 1977, Gwen and Peter Smith
watched a 6-foot, periscope-like head and neck
rise from the water near Urquhart Castle. As it
submerged again, Gwen took some film footage
from about 175 yards away with an 8-millime-
ter zoom camera. The film shows the neck sur-
facing three more times, and at one point, it ap-
pears to move its head from side to side.
On August 11, 1996, Austin Hepburn took a
photo of a solid black object moving up the loch
toward Dores and creating a wake.
The first Internet sighting of Nessie took
place in Texas on June 5, 1999, when Nora and
Mike Jones spotted, on a Webcam hosted by the
Loch Ness Monster Exhibition Centre in
Drumnadrochit, a head and neck surfacing in
the loch near Urquhart Castle.
Sonar evidence: The Rival III, a fishing vessel
passing close to Urquhart Castle, recorded the
first echo-sounder trace of an unknown target in
Loch Ness on December 2, 1954. It was swim-
ming at a depth of 480 feet.
On August 28, 1968, digital, multibeam
sonar equipment monitored by D. Gordon
Tucker and based at Temple Pier picked up two
large targets, one rising from the loch floor at
about 100 feet per minute and another moving
horizontally and then diving at 450 feet per
minute. The high rate of speed makes it unlikely
that the targets were schools of fishes.
In the summer of 1969, northeast of
Urquhart Castle, a searchlight-sonar target 600
feet away was picked up about 50 feet from the
bottom of the loch by the Vickers Oceanics re-
search submarine Pisces , commanded by R. W.
Eastlaugh. As the sub closed in, the object
moved away and was lost.
On October 10, 1969, Robert E. Love Jr., on
the motorboat Rangitea, picked up an unam-
biguous target with searchlight sonar moving in
a looped path at a depth of 220 feet for more
than three minutes northeast of Foyers. He was
using a Honeywell Scanar II-F sonar mounted
on the prow.
On August 8, 1972, Robert Rines’s team on
380 NESSIE
the Narwhal picked up with a Raytheon echo
sounder two targets that seemed to correspond
with an object photographed at the same time
(the flipper photo). The targets were about 8
feet apart; one was interpreted as a large object
with an appendage approximately 9 feet long.
Stueart Campbell believes that the target actu-
ally represents signals and delayed echos from
the other boat (the Nari) carrying the underwa-
ter camera.
On June 30 and July 1, 1976, Robert Rines
and Charles Wyckoff of Klein Associates
recorded large, moving objects on an EG&G
Mark IB side-scan sonar mounted at Temple
Pier.
In the summer of 1978, Theo Brown sus-
pended underwater loudspeakers from a small
inflatable boat southwest of Foyers and played
infrasonic recordings that attract marine preda-
tors. At one point, sonar on the boat picked up
a 30- to 50-foot animal moving up from very
deep water. It moved away when a large motor-
boat passed.
On July 21, 1978, Tom Cummings and
Garry Kozak of Klein Associates obtained a side-
scan sonar image of a moving object leaving a
turbulence wake.
From May to August 1982, Adrian Shine ob-
tained forty sonar contacts, including strong
single targets, using three kinds of sonar appara-
tus suspended from field boats.
In October 1987, a flotilla of nineteen motor
cruisers equipped with echo-sounding sonar
swept 60 percent of the loch in Operation
Deepscan, organized by Adrian Shine. Two
large, indeterminate objects were tracked mov-
ing together close to the surface. During the op-
eration, a submerged tree was discovered, which
Shine thinks was the gargoyle head pho-
tographed in 1975.
In sonar tests conducted during Nicholas
Witch ell’s Project Urquhart expedition, Colin
Bean monitored an underwater storm on the
night of July 19, 1993, caused by atmospheric
conditions at the surface. The next day, he dis-
covered two large, underwater targets in the dis-
turbance that were definitely not shoals of
fishes.
Robert Rines and Charles Wyckoff returned
to the loch in the summer of 1997 for a scien-
tific documentary sponsored by the Nova televi-
sion series. Although the producers had in-
tended to debunk Nessie, the two large sonar
contacts obtained during the expedition con-
vinced them otherwise.
Sonic surveys in 2000 found that a series of
unidentifiable sounds in the loch were matched
in frequency (747-751 hertz) only by sounds
generated by the Walrus ( Odohenus rosmarus ),
Elephant seal ( Mirounga angustirostris) , and
Killer whale ( Orcinus orca). The sounds were
like a pig grunting or a human snoring.
During a normal tour cruise on July 1, 2001,
the skipper of the M. V Nessie Hunter noticed
an unusual target on the Furuno sonar display.
The image was photographed and depicts an
elongated, sinuous object with two dorsal pro-
tuberances.
Possible explanations:
(1) A boat wake explains some observations
of a series of humps. A wake persists for
twenty to thirty minutes after the boat that
created it has passed. A standing wave (an
interference effect created when two waves
intersect) seen from a distance or from an
odd angle can be mistaken for black humps.
A distant motorboat can also be
misidentified as a moving animal.
(2) The Gray seal ( Halichoerus grypus) can
grow to 7 feet 6 inches in Canadian waters,
though specimens in the eastern Atlantic are
smaller. The largest rookeries are found in
Britain in the Hebrides, Orkneys, and
Shetland Islands. Sir Edward Mountain
advocated a seal explanation in 1934. Seals
definitely enter the loch from time to time.
Gordon Williamson photographed the
smaller Harbor seal ( Phoca vitulina) in Loch
Ness in 1985, and Dick Raynor obtained
the first photographic record of a gray seal
in a videotape taken in Urquhart Bay in
October 1999.
(3) A swimming Red deer ( Cervus elaphus)
is said by Stueart Campbell to account for
the 1952 Greta Finlay sighting. In July and
August, a male deer in its second year
carries a velvet-covered pair of short antlers
that can look like Nessie horns.
NESSIE 381
(4) Domestic cattle ( Bos taurus) sometimes
wade up to their bellies in the water and
browse from overhanging tree branches.
(5) Ducks or geese swimming or flying in
tight formation close to the surface might
appear from a distance to be a moving,
humped animal. Possible candidates for
line-of-humps or head-and-neck sightings
are the Red-breasted merganser ( Mergus
senator ), Common merganser (. Mergus
merganser ), Little grebe ( Tachybaptus
ruficollis ), Arctic loon ( Gavia arctica ),
Canada goose ( Branta canadensis ), or Great
cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo).
(6) The Sturgeon ( Acipenser sturio ) in
Britain can grow up to 9 feet long.
However, the dorsal scutes of this rare fish
are distinctive and do not match Nessie
descriptions.
(7) A giant eel, 1 8 feet long, is said at one
time to have gotten stuck in an intake at
Foyers hydroelectric station on the loch, but
this has not been substantiated. European
eels C Anguilla anguilld) only grow to 5 feet
long, while the European conger ( Conger
conger) only grows to 1 0 feet.
(8) Mirages. Objects such as logs or birds
can appear elongated or seem to move
sinuously under certain atmospheric
conditions, especially haze.
(9) Floating trees or logs upended in the
water and moving about under a strong
current may resemble Nessie.
(10) Adrian Shine and others have suggested
that thermoclines, or layers of contrasting
underwater temperatures, can generate
waves that cause inanimate objects such as
logs to appear to sink, rise, or drift in an
unusual way.
(11) Vegetation mats may form on the
bottom of the loch, then rise and move
rapidly on the surface under the pressure of
gas generated by bacteria. This explanation
has been put forward by Maurice Burton,
who wrote that logs or branches in the mat
could account for head-and-neck reports.
(12) A surviving plesiosaur, a member of a
group of marine reptiles that swam with
paddlelike limbs. Some, but not all, species
had long necks, and body length varied
from 6 to 46 feet. The eyes tended to point
upward, and the necks had limited vertical
movement, making the head-and-neck
posture unlikely. The Loch Ness animal
would have to be endothermic to survive
the Scottish climate. Plesiosaurs swam either
like sea lions, using a downward and
backward stroke, or like sea turtles, using a
figure-eight stroke that generated lift as well
as forward motion. The long-necked forms
were probably slower swimmers that
ambushed fishes from below. They are now
known to have possessed a sternum that
may have allowed terrestrial excursions.
Plesiosaur fossils are found continuously
from the Middle Triassic (238 million years
ago) to the end of the Cretaceous (65
million years ago), though there was a
smaller extinction at the end of the Jurassic
(144 million years ago) that resulted in a
reduction in diversity.
Ichthyologist Denys W. Tucker of the
British Museum of Natural History
advocated a plesiosaur explanation in 1960.
Karl Shuker also favors this hypothesis,
writing that it is not unreasonable to
suppose that descendants of these Mesozoic
marine reptiles adapted to a freshwater
environment and a cold climate, developing
different physical characteristics such as
whiskers, hair, horns, and humps.
(13) A surviving basilosaurid type of archaic
whale, suggested by Roy Mackal. Some
basilosaurids were serpentine, grew up to 80
feet long, and lived in the Late Eocene,
about 42 million years ago. They had tail
flukes, but it’s unknown whether they were
used primarily for propulsion or for
steering. These animals are mainly known
from the southeastern United States and
Egypt but may have been worldwide in
distribution.
(14) An unknown species of large, long-
necked otter was also proposed by Maurice
Burton.
(15) The European otter ( Lutra lutrd) was
favored as an explanation by Ronald Binns
and by Maurice Burton in the 1980s. It has
382 NESSIE
a dark brown, sleek body, usually 2-3 feet
long, though larger specimens have been
recorded. Its eyes are placed high on the
head so that it can see when the rest of the
body is below water. Otters are playful and
often twist and turn on the surface.
(16) An unknown species of long-necked
giant seal related to the marine LONGNECK
hypothesized by Bernard Heuvelmans. First
proposed by Antonie Cornelius Oudemans
in 1934.
(17) A Killer whale ( Orcinus orca ) was
suggested by Roy Chapman Andrews after
seeing the 1934 surgeon’s photo.
(18) A Beluga whale (D e Ip hinap terns leucas)
was proposed by P. C. Grimshaw of the
Royal Scottish Museum in 1933, though
these white whales are not found in the
North Atlantic. All modern whales have to
surface for air and breathe regularly, which
would be easily observable in the loch.
(19) A giant amphibian, advocated first by
Malcolm Burr and Rupert T. Gould in
1934 and then by Roy Mackal in 1976.
Mackal suggested a fossil eogyrinid, a
member of a family of crocodile-like
predators with eel-like tails that lived 300
million years ago, in the Carboniferous
period. These freshwater anthracosaurs were
as large as 1 5 feet long. They had weak
limbs that may have looked like flippers.
(20) In 1966, Roy Mackal suggested an
invertebrate, perhaps an unknown giant Sea
slug (Superorder Opisthobranchia) adapted
to freshwater, based on variations in Nessie’s
reported back contour.
(21) A giant form of the fossil (possibly
segmented) oceanic invertebrate
Tullimonstrum gregarium, found at Mazon
Creek, Illinois, in 1958, which lived 300
million years ago, in the Carboniferous
period. Its long proboscis (which contained
jaws with several teeth) bears a slight
similarity to the long neck and head of
Nessie; however, its eyes were located
elsewhere on the front part of the body. The
animal was only 5—6 inches in length. Its
tail had one dorsal and two horizontal fins,
all triangular. Its taxonomy is uncertain,
though some place it with the snails. This
unlikely explanation for Nessie was
promoted by F. W. Holiday in 1968.
(22) Water disturbances caused by small
earthquakes along the Great Glen Fault
were suggested by Italian geologist Luigi
Piccardi in 2001.
(23) Other explanations include: a Basking
shark ( Cetorhinus maxima the trunk of an
escaped circus Elephant ( Elephas maximus)-,
a Walrus ( O do benus rosmarus) ; World War
I-era mines; an evil spirit (proposed by
Donald Omand); a supernatural DRAGON
with links to unidentified flying objects
(UFOs) (suggested by F. W. Holiday); and
an alien pet left by space travelers
(advocated by Erik Beckjord).

feet, but it does prefer forests and dense
woodland. It is scarce but found throughout
the Congo region.

Unknown LIZARD of Central Africa.
Etymology: Lingala (Bantu), “large boa.”
Variant names: Ngonde monene, Nyama

Physical description: Huge, serpentine lizard.
Length, 30-50 feet. Body is 2-3 feet in diame-
ter. Grayish-brown. Head and neck are snake-
like. Forked tongue. Serrated ridge along the
spine. Short legs.
Behavior: Amphibious. Moves rapidly
through swamps. Eats birds and monkeys.
Distribution: Eastern Cameroon; Motaba
River, Republic of the Congo.
Significant sightings: In 1961, the eldest sister
of First Secretary of the General Assembly
Michel Zabatou was bathing in the Motaba
River when she saw a snakelike head and neck
emerge from the water about 50 feet away. Vil-
lagers ran to the spot when she cried out, and
they all watched the animal moving in the
water. It flicked its forked tongue in and out as
it moved upstream.
In November 1971, Joseph Ellis was making
his way along the Motaba River in a dugout
canoe when he saw a 30-foot serpentine animal
with a serrated back swim across the river about
200 feet away and move out of the river and
into the jungle.
Possible explanations:
(1) A surviving dolichosaur, a member of a
group of marine reptiles intermediate
between snakes and lizards that lived in the
Late Cretaceous, 95 million years ago,
suggested by Roy Mackal. These animals had
long, slender, snakelike bodies and reduced

semiaquatic lizard that grows up to 7 feet
long and is found throughout much of sub-
Saharan Africa, including the Congo basin.
When disturbed, it often swims away to the
safety of overhanging vegetation. However,
its back is smooth, not serrated.

Ngritfi Rtf ng
WlLDMAN of Southeast Asia.
Etymology: Vietnamese (Austroasiatic), “forest
man.”
Variant names: Briaou (in Laos), Khi trau
(“buffalo monkey” or “big monkey”).
Physical description: Height, less than 5 feet.
Covered in reddish, gray, brown, or black hair.
The back of the forearm is said to have a sharp
bone. Allegedly has a tail.
Behavior: Bipedal. Climbs trees easily. Uses its
forearm to cut through jungle undergrowth. Food
consists of roots, plants, and the sap of banana
trees. Shakes trees for insects. Sleeps in rocky
areas. Said to raid villages in search of food. At-
tracted to human campfires at night. The moun-
tain peoples formerly ate them. In Laos, it is said
to eat humans, with a preference for the intestines.
Tracks: Humanlike but smaller. Length, 11
inches. Width, 6 inches. Long toes.
Habitat: Montane forests.
Distribution: Three-border region of Vietnam
(including the Annam Highlands), Cambodia,
and Laos.
Significant sightings: Late on the night of Au-
gust 23, 1947, a group of Jarai, Sedang, and
Bahnar mountain people were traveling from
Kon Mahar to Kon Braih in the Annam High-
lands of Vietnam when they surprised a hairy
man who growled and ran away into the forest.
Zoologist Dao Van Tien learned about the
Wildman when he stayed at Thuan Chau, Viet-
nam, in 1963. His informant said it sneaked
into houses at night and stole food.
A U.S. Army company depot commander
named Powell fired at something moving out-
side the perimeter while he was on guard duty at
the ammunition area of the base at Cam Ranh
Bay, Vietnam, in 1967. Some drops of blood
were found, and an odd footprint, said to be
neither human nor ape, was photographed.
Wildman reports became so common during
the Vietnam War that in 1974, Gen. Hoang
Minh Thao, commander of North Vietnamese
forces in the highlands, requested a scientific
survey of the region north of Kon Turn. Profes-
sors Vo Quy and Le Vu Khoi from Hanoi Uni-
versity and Hoang Xuan Chinh from the Insti-
tute of Archaeology in Hanoi were part of the
expedition. No Ngiaoi rung were found.
In 1979, Dao Van Tien heard of a slightly
taller Wildman in the highlands around Pleiku,
Vietnam, that was in the habit of ripping into
banana trees to get the sap.
Professor Tran Hong Viet found the foot-
print of a Wildman in 1982 on the slopes of
Chu Mo Ray Mountain in Kontum Province.
Anthropologist Helmut Loofs-Wissowa col-
lected stories in 1996 about a Wildman called
Briaou around the village of Ban Kador, some
30 miles to the north of Muang Xepon in the
highlands of Laos.

Nittaewo
SMALL Hominid of the Indian subcontinent.
Etymology: Veddah (Indo-Aryan) word, possi-
bly coined from niya-atha (“one who possesses
nails”). Also possibly derived from Nishada, the
name given by Indo-Aryan speakers to the ear-
lier inhabitants of India; the Sinhala form was
Nigadiwa or Nishadiwa, which the aboriginal
Veddah people of Sri Lanka turned into Nit-
taewo.
Variant names: Nittavo, Nittawo, Vanara
(Sinhala/Indo-Aryan, “man of the woods”).
Physical description: Height, 3-4 feet. Lemales
are smaller than the males. Shaggy, red body-
hair, either covering the entire body or confined
to the legs. Dark skin. Straight head-hair. Short,
powerful arms and hands. Long nails or claws.
Behavior: Erect posture. Twittering language,
said to have been understood by the Veddah
people with whom they were at constant war.
388 NIKASEENITHULOOYEE
Food consists of raw game, including squirrels,
deer, lizards, tortoises, and crocodiles. Said to
disembowel their game (as well as their enemies)
with their long nails.
Distribution: The Yala National Park area in
southeastern Sri Lanka.
Present status : Exterminated at the end of the
eighteenth century by the Veddas, who rounded
up the last of these creatures, moved them into
a cave, and set a fire at the cave’s entrance for
three days, asphyxiating them.
Possible explanations:
(1) A conjectured short-statured race of
people related to the Semang of Malaysia,
the Negritos of the Philippines, or the
Andamanese.
(2) Surviving Homo erectus, which could
have reached the island when it was
attached to India several times prior to 5000
B.C. An isolated population might have
produced a race of smaller stature.
(3) The Hoolock gibbon ( Hylobates hoolocB)
of northern India is barely 3 feet tall when
it walks upright, and it is primarily a
vegetarian, except for eating birds’ eggs and
spiders.
(4) The Sloth bear (. Melursus ursinus) of Sri
Lanka has black fur, rarely stands upright,
and is primarily vegetarian.

Nix
MERBEING of Northern Europe.
Etymology: German, “water-man.” Nixe (for
the female); plural, Nixen. Possibly derived from
Hnikarr y an alternative name for the Teutonic
god Odinn in his guise as sea-sprite.
Variant names: Aanycke (Danish), Lorelei
(Old German, “rock lurker”), Merenneito
(Finnish), Merineitsi (Estonian), Nacken
(Swedish), Nak (Swedish), Nakineiu (Estonian
for the female), Nakinneito (Finnish for the fe-
male), Nakki (Finnish), Neck (Dutch), Nek

Stromkarl, Wassernix (German).
Physical description: In human form, a male
being of varying age — from a boy to an elder.
Often looks like either an old man with green
eyes, big ears, green teeth, and a full beard, or a
handsome man above water and a horse below.
Sometimes has an enormous mouth. The female
is a young girl, sometimes with a fish’s tail.
When it comes ashore, it can only be recognized
by its wet skirt or apron.
In animal form, the Nix resembles a snake,
bird, bull, ox, calf, pig, cat, fish, or (most com-
monly) a horse. Some legend themes describe
the Nokk as a haystack, half a boat, a log, a sil-
ver dish, or a string of pearls.
Behavior: Amphibious. Appears both on the
shore and in the water. The female sits near the
water and combs its hair with a golden comb.
Can change shape and features at will. Usually
naked but sometimes clothed. Often wears a red
cap. Said to drag humans underwater, especially
children. Shouts and sighs. Said to be an excel-
lent singer and fiddle or harp player. Owns a
herd of cattle that live in the water (see WATER
Bull). Alleged to be the spirit of a drowned
human.
Habitat: Lakes, rivers, streams, waterfalls;
often under bridges or near mills.
Distribution: Norway; Sweden; Denmark;
Iceland; Scotland; Germany; Estonia; Finland.
Possible explanations:
(1) A mythological method for marking
physical and social boundaries in
agricultural societies, according to Jochum
Stattin.
NIX 389
(2) Different sea mammals, such as otters or
seals, seen under distorting atmospheric
conditions.
(3) An elaborate mythology based on the
importance of seals and sealing to
Scandinavian life.

North American Ape
An odd lot of mystery PRIMATES reported
mostly in the southeastern and midwestern
United States.
Etymology: Term used by Loren Coleman
since the 1960s to distinguish these creatures
from Bigfoot or Hairy Bipeds. Abbreviated as
Nape {Napes, plural).
Variant names: Abominable chicken man (in
Oklahoma), Brush ape, Fouke monster,
Knobby (in North Carolina), Little red men of
the Delta, Manimal, Old Sheff, Skunk Ape,
Traverspine Gorilla.
Physical description: Chimpanzee- or gorilla-
like. Height, 4-7 feet. Brown to black hair, oc-
casionally gray or white. Green eyes. Long arms.
No tail.
Behavior: Nocturnal. Stooping gait. Walks
bipedally as well as on all fours. Can leap 20-40
feet in a single bound. Swims readily. Call is a
trumpeting howl or a high-pitched screech.
Musky odor.
Tracks: Length, 7-1 1 inches. Up to 7 inches
across. Some show an opposed big toe, set at
nearly right angles to the smaller toes. Others
are just knuckle prints or are three- toed.
Habitat: Swamplands and riverine forests.
Distribution: A partial list of places where
North American apes have been reported follows:
Alabama — Clanton, Walnut Creek.
Arkansas — Cash, Central, Fouke, Hamburg,
Mountain Home.
California — Mount Tamalpais.
Florida — Anclote River, Brooksville, Ever-
glades, Hernando County.
Illinois — Decatur, Elizabeth, Enfield, Gum
Creek, Prairie du Long Creek.
Indiana — Boone County, Hardin Ridge Recre-
ation Area, Harrison County, Lake Monroe.
Iowa — Humboldt County, Lockridge.
Labrador, Canada — Traverspine River.
Kansas — Crawford County.
Kentucky — Trimble County.
Louisiana — Crowley.
Missouri — Kinloch.
New Jersey — Boonton.
New York — Huntington, Mineola.

Oklahoma — Calumet, El Reno, Lawton.
Pennsylvania — Adams County, Blair County,
Downington, Penn Hills, Snyder County,
Verona, York County.
Tennessee — J ackson.
Texas — Gatesville.
Significant sightings: In January 1869, near
Gallipolis, Ohio, a “gorilla” attacked a man rid-
ing in a carriage.
Gorillas were reported in Snyder, Adams, and
York Counties of south-central Pennsylvania
from December 1920 to February 1921.
In June 1931, a 4-foot gorilla was reported at
a Lewis and Valentine’s nursery near Mineola,
Long Island, New York. Armed posses combed
the woods but found only some apparently
bipedal tracks with an opposed big toe. Scat-
tered reports continued in the neighborhood
until mid-July.
In the summer of 1941, Rev. Lepton Harpole
was hunting along Gum Creek near Mount
Vernon, Illinois, when he saw a baboonlike an-
imal jump down from a tree and walk on two
legs toward him. He struck it with his rifle and
fired shots to scare it away. For the next few
months, residents heard terrifying screams at
night in the woods along various creeks in Jack-
son and Okaw Counties, but hunting parties
failed to find anything but occasional tracks.
390 NORTH AMERICAN APE
Zack Clothier’s reconstruction of the foot of a North American APE. Modeled from a photograph of a footprint
discovered by Loren Coleman in the summer of 1962 , in a dry side branch of Steven’s Creek, near Decatur, Illinois.
(Loren Coleman)
Gorilla-like footprints found near El Reno, Oklahoma, in
December 1970 after a mystery animal raided a chicken
coop. (Lawrence Curtis)
In 1957, James Meacham saw a small ape
with reddish-orange fur in a tree near Jackson,
Tennessee. He watched it for five minutes be-
fore he fired fourteen rifle bullets into it at close
range, most of which apparently hit. The animal
did not budge until Meacham walked toward it,
then it quickly moved off through the trees.
In the spring of 1962, Loren Coleman dis-
covered an apelike footprint in a dry creek bed
near Decatur, Illinois. It was 10 inches long and
had a fully opposed large toe.
Ralph Chambers, of Elfers, Florida, saw an
apelike animal several times along the Anclote
River in 1966 and 1967. It had a putrid odor
that alternately terrified and enraged his dogs.
Late at night on May 1, 1971, Mrs. Bobby
Ford of Fouke, Arkansas, saw a hairy, clawed
hand reaching through the front window of her
home. She screamed, and her husband ran out-
side and took a potshot at something that
walked on two legs. The local policeman arrived
and found some catlike tracks. Later the same
night, the 6-foot, black-haired creature returned
to lurk around the house and grabbed Bobby
Ford, who panicked and ran inside, knocking
down the door and knocking himself uncon-
scious. Three-toed tracks turned up on June 14
in a soybean field southeast of town.
On April 25, 1973, Henry McDaniel and his
wife, of Enfield, Illinois, shot at a grayish, mon-
keylike animal with short arms and pink eyes
that jumped 50 feet in three leaps.
Some local boys were riding motorbikes on
trails in the Penn Hills area outside Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania, on September 22, 1973, when
they heard something large moving in the
woods nearby. The next day, a father of one of
the boys, named Baird, found some fresh, ape-
like tracks, 1 1 inches long, with an opposed toe.
On January 30, 2002, Penny Howell and
three friends saw a shaggy, black-haired, apelike
animal about 5 feet tall and standing in a crouch
south of Lake Monroe, Indiana. It had a patch
of white fur on its head and neck. When it saw
them, it turned and moved into the woods. It
left four-footed tracks with claws, about 5
inches long.
Present status: Distinctions between North
American apes, DEVIL MONKEYS, Hairy
BIPEDS, and Bigfoot are nebulous and possibly
arbitrary. In general, North American apes are
tailless and resemble chimpanzees; DEVIL MON-
KEYS are tailed and resemble baboons; Hairy
BIPEDS cover a wide range of descriptions from
apes to wildmen and paranormal entities; BlG-
FOOT is a robust, tall hominid with a range that
seems restricted to the Pacific Northwest.
Possible explanations:
(1) Feral Chimpanzees {Pan troglodytes)
escaped from zoos or traveling circuses or
transported to the United States on slave
ships in the nineteenth century. However,
chimps and other apes do not swim, and
they avoid water.
(2) Feral pet monkeys, though these would
have tails and would not run on two legs.
(3) A misidentified American black bear
( Ursus americanus).
(4) A surviving Miocene ape, Dryopithecus,
as suggested by Loren Coleman.
Dryopithecus was a European primate that
lived 1 3-9 million years ago in several
localities between Spain and the Caucasus.
Recent evidence indicates that it diverged
from the primate line shortly before
Gigantopithecus and the ancestors of the
Orangutan {Pongo pygmaeus). It had robust
392 NORTH AMERICAN APE
limbs, a small stature, and an undeveloped
browridge. Its appearance in the New
World would require an anthropological
paradigm shift.

Physical description: Large cat. Long tail with
a bushy tip.
Tracks: Wide pawprints were found.
Distribution: Nottinghamshire, England.
Significant sightings: From July 29 to August
6, 1976, police and citizens searched the coun-
tryside southeast of Nottingham for a large ani-
mal described as a lion that was first reported by
two milkmen at Tollerton. A total of sixty- five
reports were received by police, but searchers
turned up no evidence, and no livestock was
attacked.

Nsanga
Dinosaur-like animal of Central Africa, similar
to the Emela-Ntouka.

(Bantu) name for the Tiger fish ( Hydrocynus vit-
tatus) in Zambia.
Physical description: Crocodile-like. Smooth
skin. Feet have hooked claws.
Behavior: Amphibious. Feeds on hippos.
Tracks: Never seen, according to locals.
Distribution: Bangweulu Swamp, Zambia.
Significant sighting: Paul Graetz came across
some strips of this animal’s skin on Mbawala Is-
land in 1909.
Possible explanations:
(1) An unknown species of monitor lizard,
suggested by Bernard Heuvelmans.
(2) Amphibious saber-toothed cat similar to
other African WATER LIONS, proposed later
by Heuvelmans.
(3) Surviving ceratopsian dinosaur.

Ntarargo
Spotted Lion of East Africa.
Etymology: Possibly Amba (Bantu); singular,
Ruturargo.
Variant names: Enturargo, Kiiseego, Kitalargo
(contraction of kitalo-engo y “wonder leopard”),
Ntarago, Ntarargar, Uruturangwe.
Physical description: Like a cross between a
lion and a leopard. Slightly spotted coat like a
hyena’s. Retractile claws. Long tail.
Behavior: Has a distinctly gutteral, gurgling
roar; it gives a few deep grunts followed rapidly
by high-pitched shrieks.
Distribution: Ruwenzori Range, Uganda.
Significant sightings: In 1916, a mystery ani-
mal is said to have killed 100 people in Kinkizi
County, Uganda. It ignored goats and sheep
and went after the children of the herders.
A local district commissioner heard a hideous
howl when he was camped on a scarp above the
eastern shores of Lakes Edward and George,
Uganda. It terrified his porters, who said it was
the cry of the man- and cattle-killing Ntarargo.
Possible explanations:
(1) An old or exceptionally large Leopard
(. Panthera parduf Pseudomelanistic
leopards may account for observations of
some mystery beasts with a dark coat. See
Dark Leopard.
(2) Skins and bones of the Ruturargo sent
to London from the Kigezi District in the
1920s usually turned out to be from
Spotted hyenas ( Crocuta crocutd). In one
instance, the skin of a particularly large
hyena was accompanied by the skull of an
immense leopard, purportedly from the
same animal. However, confusion seems to
have resulted from the killing of two
“Enturargo” during the same hunt — one a
hyena, the other a leopard.

diplodocus and the plesiosaur as closely match-
ing the N’yamala.

Ogopogo
Freshwater Monster of British Columbia,
Canada.
Etymology: From a British music hall hit —
“The Ogo-Pogo,” written in 1924 by Cumber-
land Clark with music by Mark Strong and
made famous by Davy Burnaby. At a luncheon
on August 23, 1926, W. H. Brimblecombe of
Vernon, British Columbia, sang a parody writ-
ten by H. F. Beattie that was modified to incor-
porate some characteristics of the Okanagan
Lake monster. Ronald Kenvyn of the Vancouver
Daily Province declared “Ogopogo” its official
name on August 24, 1926.
Variant names: Auck, Hayash-hayash kust
skaka kupa lake (Chinook Jargon/Pidgin, “huge
animal in the lake”), NAITAKA, Ukuk masachi
kupa lake (Chinook Jargon/Pidgin, “wicked one
in the lake”), Yakaqansen stop.
Physical description: Serpentine. Overall
length, 20-70 feet. Black, dark green, gray, or
dark blue. Skin is smooth and shiny, with some
barnacle-like calcium deposits underneath. Head
is like a horse’s or goat’s, held at right angles to
the neck. Hornlike protrusions. Ears are rarely
reported. Whiskers or a beard. Slim neck, 5-10
feet long. Usually has two or six humps or arch-
ing coils, but as few as one and as many as four-
teen have been reported. Middle hump is the
highest out of the water (2-3 feet). Several ob-
servations suggest jointed feet that aid in swim-
ming. Tail is forked or formed by two flippers.
Behavior: Mostly active in the afternoon.
Sometimes spouts water. Swims by vertical un-
dulations at a speed up to 40 miles per hour.
Two or three animals have occasionally been
seen together. Presumably, the creature eats
fishes or freshwater shrimp, though on one oc-
casion, it was seen to snatch a seagull.
Distribution: Okanagan Lake, British Colum-
bia.
Significant sightings: Susan Allison watched a
60-foot animal swimming against the wind off
the western shore during a storm in 1872.
Lydia Hodgson, of Okanagan Landing, got a
good view of Ogopogo on July 21, 1923, as she
was riding a horse along the shore. It looked like
an “upturned boat” at first, but as she got closer,
she was able to see three humps and a head. The
animal moved its head from side to side and
moved its eyes. When Hodgson called to her
son, Ogopogo immediately submerged and
swam under water toward the center of the lake.
John L. Logie, his wife, and his driver, P. J.
Dodwell, saw a 20-foot animal on July 19,
1926, as they were driving along the lake north
of Peachland. It raced alongside their car, pro-
ducing a foot-high swell.
Ogopogo made an appearance between Gel-
latly Point and Westbank during a baptism on
November 18, 1926, where fifty or sixty people
were gathered on the shore. Witnesses said it had
a sheeplike head raised 2 feet above the water
and several coils the size of automobile wheels.
On October 6, 1935, Edward Grahame, Jim
Ripley, and Charles B. Grahame were fishing
399
Ogopogo, the lake monster of Lake Okanagan, British Columbia. (Richard Svensson/Fortean Picture Library)
near the north end of the lake when they saw
Ogopogo rise to the surface some 200 feet from
their rowboat. The animal’s undulating humps
were about 1 foot above the surface.
On February 26, 1948, bus driver Don
Nourse saw four small animals 50 feet from the
shore.
On the evening of July 2, 1949, the families
of Leslie L. Kerry and W. F. Watson Jr. watched
Ogopogo off Kelowna. It was 30 feet long, sin-
uous, and consisted of five undulations. They
saw what appeared to be a forked tail.
Rev. W. S. Beames saw Ogopogo off Nara-
mata on August 12, 1950. A disturbance de-
scribed as being like a fire hose thrashing about
was caused by several humps that submerged
and left a large wake.
In mid-July 1974, Barbara Clark was swim-
ming toward a diving platform off the southern
shore of the lake when something large and
heavy bumped her legs. After jumping on the
platform, she was able to watch a serpentine an-
imal moving through the clear water 20 feet
away. One coil was 8 feet long and 4 feet above
the water. She could also see a flukelike tail, 4-6
feet wide.
John Kirk, his son, and two members of the
British Columbia Scientific Cryptozoology
Club, Jim and Barbara Clark, were at Peach Or-
chard Beach on July 30, 1989, when they spot-
ted a 35-foot, humped animal. One large hump
was visible through a 40X telescope.
On August 1, 1989, John Kirk again saw a
3 5 -foot animal with three to six humps thrash-
ing frenziedly near Green Bay.
On July 24, 1990, Mike Guzzi noticed an
image at a depth of 350 feet on his fish-finding
sonar near Bear Creek as he was taking Japanese
reporter Masayuki Tamaki on an Ogopogo
search for Nippon TV. It seemed to consist of a
head, tail, and 30-foot-body, with bubbles com-
ing up off the head.
400 OGOPOGO
In July 1993, from a hill 6 miles north of
Penticton, John Moore watched an animal with
a horse’s head protruding about 6 feet from the
water and creating a wake. It moved in a straight
line for about thirty minutes.
In mid-August 2000, Darryl Ellis, a cancer
survivor, was swimming the entire length of the
lake to raise funds for cancer research when he
saw two Ogopogos pacing and swimming un-
derneath him near Rattlesnake Island. One was
at least 20 feet long. When he neared Okanagan
Lake Bridge, a large, grayish animal flipped out
of the water near him, and he saw an eye the size
of a grapefruit.
Photography: In early 1967, Eric Parmenter
snapped a photo showing a disturbed area of
water where a large animal had just submerged.
In August 1968, Arthur Folden shot about
one minute of 8-millimeter footage of a 70-foot
animal some 200-300 yards from shore near
Rattlesnake Island. The film shows an object
surfacing and submerging three times; unfortu-
nately, Folden stopped the camera each time it
went under water. A preliminary analysis of the
film by Kerry Voth in 2000 indicated the object
was solid, had one vertical and two lateral pro-
trusions, and emerged from the water at a
rolling angle.
On August 3, 1976, Edward R. Fletcher took
five photos of Ogopogo in the lake off the
Westbank Yacht Club. It appeared about 40
feet long in its coiled swimming position and
70-75 feet long when relaxed.
Arlene Gaal took a photo of a long, dark
hump creating a wake near Kinsmen Beach on
May 28, 1979.
On August 5, 1979, at Peachland Hill, a
tourist from Alberta shot three minutes of
movie footage that shows two Ogopogos cavort-
ing in the water. The animals churned up the
water and made loud thumping noises. The
whereabouts of this film is currently unknown.
On August 11, 1980, Vancouver tourist
Larry Thai took eight to ten seconds of Super 8
film of an animal that was seen for a total of
forty-five minutes off Monteo Beach by some
fifty tourists. The 50- to 60-foot animal sub-
merged and resurfaced, swimming back and
forth from the Okanagan Lake Bridge. Arlene
Statue of Ogopogo, Lake Okanagan, British Columbia,
1975. (Loren Coleman)
Gaal claims to be able to see a head with jaws in
an enhanced version.
Eugene Boiselle shot the first video footage of
Ogopogo — or at least an odd disturbance in the
water — on September 5, 1982, from Knox
Mountain Park.
On May 19, 1987, from the summit of Mis-
sion Hill, John Kirk videotaped nearly one
minute of a 40-foot Ogopogo swimming in the
lake.
Ken Chaplin videotaped a black, 1 5-foot an-
imal in the lake near the mouth of Bear Creek
on July 17, 1989. It arched its head, smacked its
tail on the water, and then submerged. Arlene
Gaal went to the site with Chaplin on July 22,
where, at 8:30 P.M., she saw the head and back
of a dark animal about 15-20 feet long move
from the creek out into the lake. She obtained
two still photos of it, while Chaplin shot some
video. Some analysts think the animal is a
beaver.
On August 26, 1989, near Peachland, John
Kirk was able to videotape Ogopogo again as a
distant hump for about twenty- five minutes.
Paul DeMara videotaped an animal creating a
disturbance in the lake on July 24, 1992, from a
OGOPOGO 401
cottage near Okanagan Centre. His wife,
mother, and several friends watched as a water-
skier crossed its path and tumbled into the water.
DeMara shot two more video sequences of un-
known objects in the lake over the next five to
ten minutes. The final one seems to show a head,
neck, and part of a back rising from the water.
Michael Zaiser took five photos of a 40-foot,
long-necked animal making a disturbance in the
water off Okanagan Mountain Park in February
1996.
On April 18, 2002, a film crew in the process
of staging a re-creation of a 1978 Ogopogo
sighting shot 90 seconds of footage showing
three humps undulating in the water about 200
yards away. Fourteen observers, including the
original witness, Bill Steciuk, watched the black,
shiny creature.
Possible explanations:
(1) The White sturgeon ( Acipenser
transmontanus) is the largest freshwater fish
in North America and grows to 20 feet in
length. In British Columbia, it is found in
the Fraser/Nechako, Columbia, and
Kootenay River systems but has never been
officially recorded in Okanagan. The body
is covered in large bony scutes rather than
scales.
(2) A group of ducks swimming in a line.
Okanagan is a major summer breeding area
for the Common merganser ( Mergus
merganser).
(3) Unlikely explanations proposed in the
1920s included the marine Oarfish
(. Regalecus glesne) and the tropical Manatee
(Family Trichechidae).
(4) A basilosaurid whale, a member of a
family of archaic whales that lived 42-33
million years ago, in the Middle to Late
Eocene, suggested by Roy Mackal. Barbara
Clark’s 1974 observation is particularly
basilosaurid-like.
(5) A plesiosaur-like reptile related to
Caddy, according to Ed Bousfield.

Ohio Pygmy
SMALL Hominid of North America.
Physical description: Height, 3 feet— 4 feet 6
inches.
Distribution: Two miles south of Coshocton,
Ohio.
Significant sightings: In the early nineteenth
century, a burial site containing the remains of
up to 3,000 humans was found near Coshocton,
Ohio, along the Muskingum River. Many of the
skeletons appeared to be less than 4 feet 6 inches
in height. Traces of wood suggested to the dis-
coverers that the burials had been in coffins.
Possible explanation: The bones were either
the remains of children or disarticulated adults.
The cemetery was plowed over long ago; all that
remained in 1975 was a mound at its southern
edge.

head over the deepest part of Monterey Bay. It
was 30 feet long and had a fishlike tail, a face
like an old man’s, huge eyes, and a mouth like a
crescent moon.
In the fall of 1939, the crew of the albacore
boat Santa Anna got within a few feet of an an-
imal that at first looked like a log, 9 miles south-
west of the Point Pinos lighthouse. They poked
it with a gaff and realized it was more like a seal
but fifty times the size of a sea elephant, with
seal-like fins on either side of its body.

Old Ned
Freshwater Monster of New Brunswick,
Canada.
Physical description: Serpentine. Length,
10-30 feet. Dark red. Head like an alligator’s or
a horse’s. One pair of fins.
Behavior: Likes to sun itself. Said to migrate
down rivers in August.
Tracks: Leaves furrows in the sand.
Distribution: Utopia Lake, New Brunswick.
Significant sightings: First reported around
1856 by lumbermen from St. George. In 1868,
an animal was brought to the surface when 25
pounds of dynamite were set off under the
water. Four shots were fired at it, but it appar-
ently survived. A 28-foot animal allegedly killed
in a field of grass 200 feet from the shore of Pas-
samaquoddy Bay, New Brunswick, on August
3, 1868, was shown in a traveling exhibit. The
exhibition flyer claimed it was 13 feet in girth,
with legs 5 feet 4 inches long and a mouth 5 feet
6 inches wide.
On July 9, 1982, Sherman Hart and three
others watched an animal surface about half a
mile away. Its back was about 10-15 feet long
and 1-2 feet above the water.
Possible explanations:
(1) Floating logs.
(2) The Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salaf) grows
to 4 feet 6 inches and has black spots on its
head and body. Breeding adults in
freshwater are greenish- or reddish-brown
mottled with red or orange.
(3) The Atlantic sturgeon ( Acipenser
oxyrhynchus) grows to 14 feet in length. It
has a long, sharply V-shaped snout and is
covered with oval, bony scutes.
(4) The American eel ( Anguilla rostrata) was
once very common in the lake and attains a
length of 5 feet.
(5) A swimming deer could appear to be a
lake monster.
(6) The Northern river otter ( Lontra
canadensis) reaches a length of 3-4 feet,
including the tail.

Old Sheff
North American Ape of Kansas.
Physical description: Long arms. Large hands.
Behavior: Walks bipedally with a stooping
gait. Also goes on all fours. Pulls down fences.
Distribution: Crawford County, Kansas.
Significant sighting: In August 1869, a threat-
ening, gorilla-like animal terrorized the farmers
of Crawford County, Kansas. People were un-
willing to shoot it because it looked human.

Oldeani Monster
Mystery LIZARD of East Africa.
Scientific name: Chamaeleo oldeanii , proposed
by Peter Scott.
Physical description: Chameleon-like. Brown,
with small red spots and a horizontal stripe
across each flank. Small horn at the tip of its
snout. Long tail.
Distribution: Ngorongoro Conservation Area,
Tanzania.
Significant sighting: On Lebruary 25, 1962,
Peter Scott and John and Jane Hunter saw a
large chameleon in the Ngorongoro Conserva-
tion Area near Oldeani Peak, Tanzania. They
captured it, and Scott took it back to England,
where it lived for eighteen months. Its remains
were preserved a short time before they were
lost. Herpetologists were unable to identify the
animal.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Dwarf Jackson chameleon
( Chamaeleo jacksonii merumontand ) ,
suggested by Dick Hellenius, though this
subspecies is confined to the Mount Meru
area 90 miles distant.
(2) A juvenile Meller’s chameleon (C. melleri).
(3) A hitherto undescribed species,
suggested by Peter Scott.
(4) Bradypodion uthmoelleri , a rare
chameleon discovered in 1938 and
restricted to the Ngorongoro area, proposed
by Karl Shuker.

Olitiau
Flying Reptile or giant Bat of Central Africa.
Etymology: Ipulo (Benue-Congo) word. Possi-
bly a mistaken transcription of Ole Ntya
(“cloven” or “forked”), which is the name of a
dance mask with horns that is used to represent
a demon.
Physical description: Black body. Lower jaw is
filled with 2-inch-long teeth separated from
each other by spaces of equal width. Black, bat-
like wings. Wingspan, 6-12 feet.
Behavior: Flies with a slow, flapping motion
of its wings. Its teeth chatter.
Habitat: Mountain streams.
Distribution: Southwestern Cameroon.
Significant sighting: An Olitiau swooped
down on Ivan T. Sanderson and Gerald Russell
shortly after they shot a hammer-headed fruit
bat along a mountain stream in southern
Cameroon in 1932.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Hammer-headed fruit bat
(. Hypsignathus monstrosus) is the largest
African bat and has a wingspan up to 3 feet.
It is sepia on the back, with a pale brown
head and shoulders. Sanderson and Russell
may have been surprised by a much larger
specimen of the bat they had just shot.
However, these bats are usually shy and
harmless.
OLITIAU 405
(2) The Yellow-winged bat ( Lavia frons) is
the largest African insectivorous species.
However, the wingspan is no more than 1 6
inches. It has blue-gray body fur and
distinctive yellow or orange wings.
(3) An unknown large bat with an
enormous wingspan, possibly a member of
the Microchiroptera suborder, suggested by
Karl Shuker.
(4) A surviving pterosaur, a member of a
group of winged reptiles that lived from the
Late Jurassic to the end of the Cretaceous,
150-65 million years ago, which may also
explain the KONGAMATO. Sanderson
insisted what he saw was a bat, but the
dentition seems reptilian. There is some
fossil evidence suggesting that pterosaurs
had hair, though this has been disputed.

Oliver
Odd PRIMATE of Central Africa.
Significant sighting: In the 1970s, an unusual-
looking male chimpanzee nicknamed “Oliver”
was the center of a controversy involving an un-
substantiated claim that it only had forty-seven
chromosomes. (Chimpanzees normally have
forty-eight, humans forty-six.)
Possible explanation: Theories abounded that
Oliver was a mutant, a new species, a Chim-
panzee (Pan troglodyte s) x Bonobo (Pan paniscus)
hybrid, or even a bonobo x SEHITE hybrid. A
1998 study of Oliver’s mitochondrial DNA,
however, showed that he did have forty-eight
chromosomes and was merely an odd but normal
African chimp, probably from Gabon.

On Niont
Freshwater Monster of Ontario, Canada.
Etymology: Huron (Iroquois) word.
Physical description: Serpentine. Horn on its
forehead.
Distribution: Ontario.

On^a-Cangu^u
Mystery Cat of South America.
Etymology: Portuguese, “big-headed jaguar,”
after the Guarani (Tupi) akangusu (“big head”).
Physical description: Black. Jaguarlike. White
collar. Tufted tail tip.
Distribution: Rio Aripuana, Mato Grosso
State, and Rio Madeira, Amazonas State, Brazil.
Significant sightings: In 1996 and 1997,
Dutch zoologist Marc van Roosmalen glimpsed
what he considers to be a new species of black
Jaguar (Panthera onca) from the Rio Madeira
area. He collected further reports in 2000 from
the Rio Aripuana.

One-Horned African Rhinoceros
Rhinoceros-like HOOFED Mammal of East and
South Africa.
Physical description: Rhinoceros with only one
horn.
406 OLIVER
Distribution: Ethiopia; Gees Gwardafuy, So-
malia; White Nile and the area south of Sannar,
Sudan; Lake Chad area, Chad; northern
Mozambique; northern South Africa.
Significant sightings: A small, gold-plated arti-
fact depicting a rhinoceros with a single horn
was discovered at the Mapungubwe archaeolog-
ical site, Northern Province, South Africa. It
dates from the twelfth century.
Scattered reports from the early nineteenth
century attested to the existence of a one-horned
rhino in sub-Saharan Africa.
Present status: The two extant species of
African rhinos have two horns. The black rhi-
noceros lingers tenuously in widely scattered
pockets of East, Central, and South Africa; the
white rhinoceros is now limited to KwaZulu-
Natal Province in South Africa and the border-
lands of the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Sudan, and Uganda. For the most part, rumors
of a one-horned species exist in areas that are no
longer part of the range of either species.
Possible explanations:
(1) A Black rhinoceros ( Diceros bicornis) or
White rhinoceros ( Ceratotherium simurri)
that has lost one horn due to injury.
(2) According to Richard Lydekker, some
white rhinos never fully develop a posterior
horn; the growth becomes only an
inconspicuous tubercle.
(3) An unknown species of one-horned
rhinoceros that formerly existed on the
African continent.

Onyare
Freshwater Monster of Quebec, Canada.
Etymology: Mohawk (Iroquoian) word.
Variant name: O-ni-a-re.
Physical description: Serpentine or loglike.
Horns or antlers on forehead.
Behavior: Its breath brings on sickness.
Distribution: St. Lawrence River, off Caugh-
nawaga, Quebec.

Legend,” Journal of American Folklore 19
(1906): 127-129.
Onza
Pumalike big Cat of Mexico.
Etymology: Spanish, “ounce,” derived from
the Vulgar Latin luncea (“lynx”). In Spain, onza
refers to the Cheetah ( Acinonyx jubatus). In
Venezuela and Colombia, it refers to the
Jaguarundi ( Herpailurus yaguarondi ). In
Guatemala, the word onsa is used for the Ocelot
( Leopardus pardalis) , while in Brazil, the Por-
tuguese word onga is used for the Jaguar ( Pan-
ther a onca ).
Physical description: Very similar to a puma
but thinner. Weight, 60-70 pounds. Tawny-
colored fur, with gray on the legs and shoulders.
Also said to have faint stripes on the shoulders
and a long, dark stripe down the back. Ears
longer than a puma’s. Spots or stripes on the in-
side of the legs. Longer legs than a puma’s.
Behavior: More aggressive than the puma.
Likes to kill hunting dogs.
Tracks: Like puma tracks but longer and less
round. Claw marks visible.
Habitat: Mountains with dense vegetation.
Distribution: The Sierra Madre Occidental
from southern Sonora to Nayarit States, Mex-
ico.
Significant sightings: A female Onza was shot
in March 1938 by Joseph H. Shirk, who was on
a hunting trip east of San Ignacio, Sinaloa State,
with Clell and Dale Lee as guides; however,
photos taken after the kill seem to show an or-
dinary puma.
ONZA 407
Andres Rodriguez Murillo and Ricardo
Zamora killed a female Onza near San Ignacio
on January 1, 1986. J. Richard Greenwell and
Troy L. Best examined the animal in February
and preserved the skull, leg bones, and tissue
samples for further analysis. Electrophoresis and
mitochondrial DNA testing on the tissue sam-
ples have shown them to be identical to North
American puma samples.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Onza is now seen as a local
variation of the common Puma ( Puma
concolor ), which is found throughout
Mexico, perhaps adapted to a specific
environment. Tissue samples from a
specimen obtained in 1986 proved to be
indistinguishable from those of a puma.
(2) Many Mexican hunters believe it is a
jaguar x puma hybrid, although the animal
has few jaguarlike characteristics. Also, there
is no evidence that such hybrids occur.
(3) A new species closely related to the
puma, though this is now considered
unlikely.
(4) A subspecies of puma distinct from the
local Sierra Madre puma {P. c. aztecd).
However, subspecies cannot, by definition,
coexist in the same region.
(5) Helmut Hemmer thought the Onza
might be an American cheetah (. Miracinonyx
trumani ), a fossil felid that lived in the Late
Pleistocene, 20,000-10,000 years ago.
(6) A female puma suffering from vitamin
deficiency and tuberculosis following the
birth of a litter, suggested by Clinton
Keeling. However, a male specimen that
showed classic Onza features was killed in
Sinaloa State on April 15, 1995, by Raul
Jiminez Dominguez.

Physical description: Serpentine. Length,
35-60 feet. Cowlike head. Two horns or tenta-
cles. Long neck.
Behavior: Swims in undulations.
Distribution: Waterton Lake, in Montana and
Alberta, Canada.
Significant sighting: A snakelike animal with
8-inch prongs on its back was seen in August
1956.

Orang Bati
Flying Humanoid of Southeast Asia.
Etymology: Malay (Austronesian), “flying
man.”
Physical description: Humanlike. Height, 4-5
feet. Red skin. Black wings. Long, thin tail.
Behavior: Nocturnal. Flies from the interior
to the coast at night. Call is a long wail. Said to
seize infants and children and carry them back
to its lair.
Habitat: Dormant volcanos.
Distribution: Ambon, Indonesia; Mount
Kairatu in Ceram, Indonesia.
Possible explanation: An unknown species of
giant bat, if not completely mythical.
Source: Karl Shuker, “Is Batman Alive and
Well and Living on the Island of Seram?”

Orang Dalam
Giant Hominid of Southeast Asia.
Etymology: Malay (Austronesian), “man of the
interior.” This term is common throughout
Malaysia and Indonesia and usually refers to tribes
in the jungle or hills. In peninsular Malaysia, it
generally refers to the Senoi people. However,
when used by the Senoi themselves, the term may
refer both to humans and to other hominids.
408 OOGLE-BOOGLE
Variant names: Ensut ensut (in Melaka),
Hantu jarang gigi (“thin- tooth demon”), Kaki
besar (Malay/ Austronesian, “big foot”).
Physical description: Height, 6-10 feet. Cov-
ered with dark-brown hair. Red eyes.
Behavior: Bipedal. Powerful smell like urine.
Eats fishes. Approaches humans in a friendly
way at first, then becomes frightened and runs
away.
Tracks: Four- toed. Length, 16-19 inches.
Width, 8-10 inches.
Distribution: Pahang, Johor, Melaka, and
Perak States, Malaysia.
Significant sightings: In 1959, a mining engi-
neer named Arthur Potter was sleeping in his
boat by the side of Lake Tasek Chini, Pahang
State, Malaysia, when something lifted off part
of the roof of the boat. He switched on a flash-
light and saw a huge, red eye. The next day, he
found 18-inch tracks in the mud.
Apelike footprints 18 inches long, 6 inches
wide, and 5 inches deep were found near Sega-
mat, Johor State, in early August 1966.
In 1970, Harold Stephens and Kurt Rolfes
photographed giant hominid tracks, 19 inches
long and 10 inches wide, on a sandbar in the
upper reaches of the Sungai Endau River, Pa-
hang State.
Students at a vocational institute near Lumut,
Perak State, reported seeing 10-foot hairy crea-
tures at night during the second week of August
1979.
Huge, four-toed footprints were found near
Cape Tanjung Piai, Johor State, on January 12,
1995.

Orang Gugu
Alternate name for the ORANG PENDEK of
Southeast Asia.
Variant names: Gugu, Orang goegoeh.
Physical description: Small, humanlike crea-
ture. Height, 4-5 feet. Long, red or black head-
hair that extends down its back in a mane.
Behavior: Individuals with red manes are said
to be docile; the ones with black manes are
larger and aggressive.
Distribution: Sumatra, Indonesia.
Significant sighting: This creature is well
known to the Kubu people of Propinsi Jambi
and Riau, Sumatra, who leave gifts for it when
passing through its territory. These gifts include
chewing tobacco, for which the Gugu has ap-
parently acquired a habit. Without a gift, the
Gugu will screech, pester, and throw things.

Orang Pendek
Unknown PRIMATE or SMALL HOMINID of
Southeast Asia.
Etymology: Malay (Austronesian), “short
man.” Said to be the local name around
Bengkulu and Palembang, Sumatra.
Variant names: Am pandek, Atu rimbo, Ijaoe,
ORANG Gugu, Orang letjo (“gibbering man”),
Orang pandek, Sedabo, Sedapa, Sindai, Uhang
pandak.
Physical description: Height, 2 feet 6 inches-5
feet 6 inches. Covered with short, reddish-
orange, dark-brown, or black hair but is less
hairy on the face. Pinkish-brown skin. Its jet-
black head-hair extends in a mane down its
back. Recent reports describe individuals with
manes of yellow or tan hair. Pointed head (pos-
sible sagittal crest). High forehead. Bushy eye-
brows. Humanlike eyes. Prominent ears. Broad
nose. Long canine teeth. Thick, square shoul-
ders. Large potbelly. Long arms.
Behavior: Prefers walking on the ground but
seems comfortable in trees. Walks with weight
placed on outer edge of its foot. Runs on two
legs, sometimes holding its arms outward.
Makes whistling and babbling noises. Distress
call is “hu-hu.” Food consists of shoots, sugar-
cane, fruit (especially durian), freshwater mol-
lusks, snakes, and worms. Occasionally raids
plantations or gardens.
Tracks: Length, 5-6 inches. Like a human’s
but broader (4 inches wide) and shorter. Some
prints show all five toes of equal size; others
show a prominent big toe, sometimes semiop-
posed. Heel, in some cases, is narrow and well
rounded.
Distribution: Southern Sumatra, Indonesia,
south of the equator. May now be restricted to
the Mount Kerinci region south of Padang.
Significant sightings: Edward Jacobson found
some curious footprints at the edge of the
Danau Bento swamp, southeast of Mount Ker-
inci, Sumatra, on August 21, 1915. His Suma-
tran guide, Mat Getoep, said the 5 -inch tracks
had been made by an Orang pendek.
A plantation manager named Oostingh ran
across an Orang pendek in the forest near Bukit
Kaba, Sumatra, in December 1917. When the
creature noticed him, it stood up, calmly walked
several paces, then swung up into the trees.
A Dutch settler named Van Herwaarden got
a close look at an Orang pendek in a tree in the
jungle north of Palembang, Sumatra, in Octo-
ber 1923. He had the animal in his gun sights,
but it looked so human that he felt he would be
committing murder to kill it.
Harry Gillmore and Otto Irrgang found
small, bipedal, humanlike tracks between the
Kampar and Siak Kecil Rivers, Riau Province,
Sumatra, Indonesia, in 1958. There were no
telltale claw marks such as a bear would have
made.
In 1989, British travel writer Deborah Martyr
discovered Orang pendek tracks in southwest-
ern Sumatra that were about the size of a seven-
year-old child’s. She sent a plaster cast of one
print to the Indonesian National Parks Depart-
ment, but it has been lost.
After five years of searching, Martyr finally
saw an Orang pendek in the Mount Kerinci area
on September 30, 1994. Walking confidently
on two legs, it paused to look at her from 200
yards away, then moved off into the jungle. She
has glimpsed the animal twice more since then.
After a strong earthquake near Liwa in 1995,
Claude Petit talked to several local people who
reported that animals looking like the Orang
pendek came out of the forest, frightened by the
seismic activity.
Clumps of Orang pendek hair found in 2001
near Mount Kerinci, Sumatra, by an amateur
British team led by Adam Davies were sent to
the Oxford Institute of Molecular Medicine for
DNA analysis. Davies also found tracks with
semiopposed big toes that were not made by any
known primate.
Present status: Investigations in the 1990s by
Deborah Martyr, Claude Petit, and Yves Lau-
monier have uncovered encouraging eyewitness
testimony, tracks, and hair samples.
Possible explanations:
(1) An unknown species of primate. It
410 ORANG PENDEK
could be related to the Siamang (Hylo bates
syndactylus ), the largest gibbon, which
stands about 3 feet tall and inhabits the
same general area.
(2) The Orangutan ( Pongo pygmaeus ), also a
Sumatran native, is more strictly arboreal. It
has long, reddish-brown hair, very long
arms, and a large, heavy body. Adult males
have large cheek pouches, opposable thumbs
and big toes, and long fingers and toes.
Adult males stand 4 feet 6 inches tall, while
females are 3 feet 6 inches tall.
(3) A Sumatran occurrence of the Bonobo
C Pan paniscus ), a chimpanzee found only in
Central Africa, has been suggested by
Deborah Martyr. It has a rounder cranium
than other chimps, less pronounced
browridges, and less of a tendency to go
bald.
(4) Prints of the hind feet of the Sun bear
(. Helarctos malayanus) are similar to small
human footprints. However, bear tracks are
generally blurred because bears tend to put
their hind feet in the prints left by their
front feet. This small (4 feet 6 inches) bear
often stands on its hind feet, though it does
not walk upright. Its short, black hair might
lead to misidentification at a distance.
(5) A surviving Homo erectus, though the
Orang pendek is smaller and much less
robust. No fossil hominids have been found
in Sumatra, although the erectus discoveries
near Trinil in Java by Eugene Dubois are
well known. Not all anthropologists agree
on the age of these fossils, though some put
them in the Middle Pleistocene,

Aussie, meaning “Australian.”
Physical description: Serpentine. Length, 50
feet. Square dorsal fins.
Distribution: Coast of Western Australia.
Significant sightings: Seen off Carnarvon,
Western Australia, by a fishing vessel between
May and July 1999.

Ossun Lizard
Mystery LIZARD of Western Europe.
Physical description: Green scales. Length, 5-7
feet. Skin folds around the throat.
Habitat: Subterranean lakes.
Distribution: Ossun-ez-Angles, Hautes-
Pyrenees Department, France.
Significant sightings: On February 15, 1893, a
country priest saw a large, green lizard near
Ossun. It was seen again on May 25 on a branch
of an oak tree.
In May 1939, women picking berries near
OSSUN LIZARD 411
Ossun saw a similar reptile. Police searched in
vain for the animal.
Possible explanation: An escaped American
iguana ( Iguana iguana).

OTTERS (Unknown)
The Otters constitute a Subfamily (Lutrinae) of
aquatic carnivores closely related to Weasels,
Badgers, and Skunks (Family Mustelidae). They
have elongated, torpedo-shaped bodies with
long, powerful tails. The head is flat and broad,
the legs are short, and the feet are webbed. Some
species have claws. There are seven extant gen-
era: the Small-clawed otter of East and South-
east Asia ( Amblonyx)\ the Clawless otters of
Africa (Aonyx); New World river otters ( Lontra)\
Old World river otters ( Lutra)\ the Smooth-
coated otter of Asia ( Lutrogale)\ the Giant otter
of South America ( Pteronura)\ and the Sea otter
(. Enhydra ). Some taxonomists place the New
World river otters and the Smooth-coated otter
in the genus Lutra.
Some molecular evidence indicates that otters
diverged from the weasel lineage about 20 mil-
lion years ago. Although the Sea otter ( Enhydra
lutris) reaches a total length of nearly 5 feet and
the Giant otter ( Pteronura brasiliensis) some-
times stretches to 6 feet, fossil otters were occa-
sionally larger. One Eurasian genus ( Enhydri -
odori) from the Late Miocene to the Late
Pleistocene (15 million-100,000 years ago) in-
cludes the largest known, a species with legs as
long as a leopard’s. A related North American
species ( Enhydritherium terraenovae) from
Florida was about the same size.
The four cryptids in this section (on four dif-
ferent continents) may actually represent un-
known species of otters. A hypothetical marine
otter (SUPER-OTTER) has also been proposed as
an explanation for some Sea MONSTER reports,
and misidentified river otters may occasionally
be responsible for certain FRESHWATER MON-
STER sightings.

browridge. Blue-gray eyes. Receding chin. Pow-
erful neck. Upper arms are longer than its fore-
arms. Thighs are longer than its shins. No tail.

Owlman
Dubious FLYING EIumanoid of Cornwall, En-
gland.
Physical description: Covered in gray feathers.
Owl-like head. Red, glowing, slanted eyes.
Pointed ears. Humanlike legs but bent slightly
backward. Black talons.
Behavior: Can rise vertically into the air.
Distribution: Mawnan, Cornwall.
Significant sightings: Two children, June and
Vicky Melling, were the first to report the Owl-
man, which they saw on April 17, 1976, hover-
ing above the Mawnan church tower.
On July 4, 1976, teens Sally Chapman and
Barbara Perry were camping in the woods near
town when they saw a similar figure standing 20
yards away. It went straight up into the air.
The final sighting occurred on August 2,
1978, when three French girls saw a big, furry
bird with a gaping mouth and big eyes by the
Mawnan church.
Possible explanations:
(1) An escaped Eurasian Eagle-owl ( Bubo
bubo), not normally seen in the British Isles.
The world’s largest owl (4 feet 4 inches
long), it is found in much of Europe, east to
Siberia, and south to India and China.
(2) Much confusion, if not deliberate

invention, about Owlman has been spread
by Irish magician-prankster Tony “Doc”
Shiels, who was simultaneously involved
with the MORGAWR sea monster sightings.

Ozark Howler
Dubious CAT-like animal of the south-central
United States.
Variant names: Black howler, Mountain
howler, Night howler, Ozark black mystery cat.
Physical description: Length, 4-5 feet. Size of
a large bobcat or lynx. Thick, black fur. Ear
tufts. Glowing eyes. Tail, 12-14 inches.
Behavior: Distinctive howl, heard at dusk.
Not afraid of humans.
Distribution: Ozark Mountains of Missouri
and Arkansas.
Present status: An unnamed University of
Memphis student created most of the legend as
an Internet hoax in 1998, but others say there
have been reports of medium-sized black cats in
the Ozarks since at least the 1950s.
Possible explanation: A Bobcat ( Lynx rufus) x
Domestic cat ( Felis silvestris catus) hybrid.

p
Packda
Unknown PRIMATE of Southeast Asia.
Etymology: Tagbanwa (Austronesian), “big ape.”
Physical description: Like a big monkey.
Habitat: Mountains.
Distribution: Palawan Island, Philippines.
Source: Dean C. Worcester, The Philippine
Islands and Their People (New York:
Macmillan, 1899), pp. 96-99, 115-116.
Paddler
Freshwater Monster of Idaho.
Etymology: Named for its habit of creating
waves and other water disturbances.
Physical description: A large fish.
Behavior: Makes odd wave patterns.
Distribution: Lake Pend Oreille, Idaho.
Significant sightings: The first report was ap-
parently made in August 1944 at Farragut
Naval Training Station.
In late May 1985, Julie Green and friends
were boating when they saw a V-shaped wake
caused by a dark-gray object moving faster than
her boat.
Possible explanations:
(1) The White sturgeon ( Acipenser
transmontanus) can grow to a length of 20
feet, but the presence of this fish in Lake
Pend Oreille has not been officially
established.
(2) Secret submarine sonar tests by the U.S.
Navy might account for mysterious waves
and wakes, according to Patrick Huyghe.
James McLeod has noticed that sightings
tend to coincide with navy sub tests, and he
suspects naval personnel may encourage the
Paddler legend in order to cloak their
experiments.

Carnivorous. Said to attack humans in kayaks.
Can be summoned by tapping on boat bottoms
or wooden piers.
Habitat: Seen more often in bay areas than on
the open ocean.
Distribution: Nunivak and King Islands,
Bering Strait, Alaska; also said to frequent the
Kuskokwim River, Alaska.
Possible explanation: An unknown species of

Pale Slow Loris
Mystery PRIMATE of Southeast Asia.
Physical description: Larger and paler in color
than a slow loris.
Distribution: Vietnam.
Significant sightings: Douglas Richardson, as-
sistant curator of mammals at the London Zoo,
saw a peculiar specimen of primate exhibited in
the animal market at Hanoi, Vietnam, in De-
cember 1994. It looked like a slow loris but was
larger and a pale cream color.
Possible explanation: The Slow loris ( Nyctice -
bus coucang) is a stump-tailed prosimian 12-16
inches in length that ranges from northeastern
India and Myanmar to Indochina and Indone-
sia. It has a distinctive brown stripe down its
back and brown circles around its owl-like eyes.
Its head and shoulders are silvery-white, creamy,
or gray; the flanks and rump are rusty, buff, or
ash-gray.

Pallid Sailfln
One of Beebe’s Abyssal Fishes of the North
Atlantic Ocean.
Scientific name: Bathyembryx istiophasma,
given by William Beebe.
Physical description: Torpedo-shaped fish, 2
feet in length. Pale olive-drab color. Small eye.
Large mouth. Long, wide, filamentous pectoral
fin. No luminous organs.
Distribution: North Atlantic Ocean.
Significant sighting: Observed only once, be-
tween 1,500 and 2,500 feet, by William Beebe
in a bathysphere off Bermuda in the early 1930s.
Source: William Beebe, Half Mile Down
(New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1934).
Palmyra Fish
Unknown CETACEAN of the Indian Ocean.
Etymology: Its fin was reminiscent of the
Palmyra palm tree ( Borassus flabelliformis) of the
Malabar Coast, India, which has a straight,
black, upright trunk.
Physical description: Length, 25 feet. Grayish-
black. Distinctive, erect dorsal fin about 5 feet
long on the highest part of its back.
Distribution: The Gulf of Mannar, between
Cape Comorin, India, and Sri Lanka.
Significant sighting: E. W. H. Holdsworth ob-
served this whale in the Gulf of Mannar off Chi-
law Town, Sri Lanka, on April 7, 1868. The In-
dian crew of his ship was familiar with the whale
and called it the Palmyra fish.
Possible explanation: The Killer whale ( Orci -
nus orca) has a high dorsal fin, but Holdsworth
was convinced the animal was not one of these.

Pamba
Freshwater Monster of East Africa.
Etymology: Swahili (Bantu) word.
Distribution: Lake Tanganyika, Tanzania.
Probable explanation: Pamba is the local name
for the Tanganyika lates {Fates angustifrons) , a
perchlike fish that grows to 6 feet 6 inches in
length and is endemic to Lake Tanganyika.
Source: W. L. Speight, “Mystery Monsters of
Africa,” Empire Review 71 (1940): 223-228.
Pan
Mythical WlLDMAN of Southern Europe. The
Greek god of shepherds, flocks, fertility, and
male sexuality, with composite human and goat
features. See also Satyr.
Etymology: Greek, “all.” In one of the Ho-
meric hymns, it was said to mean that the sight
of Pan amused all the Immortals. Alternative
derivations include a contraction of the Doric
pan-on (“pasturer”); also, the Old Slavonic pan
(“lord”).
Variant names: Aegipan (Pan of the goats),
Aigipanos, Faun, Great God Pan, Satyr, Sil-
VANUS.
Physical description: Hairy. Wrinkled face.
Two goat’s horns on the forehead. Pug nose.
Prominent chin. Beard like a goat’s. Goat’s
hooves instead of feet. Tail.
416 PALE SLOW LORIS
Behavior: Swift runner. Excellent rock
climber. Piercing cry. Lives in a cave. Plays
music on reed pipes (syrinx). Carries a stick for
hunting rabbits. Feared by travelers, hence the
word panic (from the Greek panikon ).
Habitat: Thickets, forests, mountains.
Distribution: Mount Likeo, in Arcadia,
Greece, was the focal point for the Pan cult.
Also known in Egypt, West Africa, and Asia.
Significant sightings: Ancient workers in a
marble quarry on Khios, Greece, discovered an
impression resembling the “head of Pan” within
a slab of stone. News of the find circulated back
to Rome, according to Cicero.
Pomponius Mela places a population of Pans
on a desolate mountain of Africa, where their
campfires lit the night and their cymbals, tam-
bours, and flutes produced unearthly music.
Bernard Heuvelmans identifies the area as the
Anti-Atlas Mountains in Morocco. However,
Mela is quoting the Carthaginian seafarer
Hanno’s account of his visit in the early fifth
century B.C. to an apparent volcano described as
“Chariot of the Gods” ( Theon ochema :), which
others have suggested is either Mount Kakulima
in Guinea or the volcanic Cameroon Mountain
in Cameroon.
Possible explanations:
(1) A mythical representation of
precivilized, Neolithic Greece.
(2) A folk memory of Neanderthals ( Homo
neanderthalensis) or archaic Homo sapiens.
(3) An imaginative explanation for the
discovery of fossil animal bones in Greece.

PANGOLINS (Unknown)
The Pangolins (Order Pholidota) are a peculiar
group of toothless primitive mammals with an
outer covering of large, overlapping epidermal
scales that make them look like walking
pinecones. The eight living species, all in the
genus Manis, live in sub-Saharan Africa, India,
and Southeast Asia. They range in size from 1
foot 6 inches— 4 feet 6 inches long, including the
tail, and consist of both arboreal and terrestrial
forms. The oldest fossil pangolin is Eomanis ,
which lived in Germany during the Middle
Eocene period, 45 million years ago. Their place
on the evolutionary tree is a bit uncertain,
though some taxonomists classify them as a sis-
ter order to the xenarthra (armadillos, sloths,
and anteaters).
Only one cryptopangolin is known, a large
animal in Indonesia. Pangolins are not known
from South America; otherwise, Ramon Lista’s
lEMISCH sighting might have rated inclusion.

Paraguayan Barking Snake
Dubious Snake of South America.
Variant name: Mboi-yagua (“tiger snake”),
probably Guarani (Tupi), although alleged to be
Paraguayan Spanish ( yagua comes close to the
Spanish yaguar, “jaguar”).
Physical description: Length, 1 0 feet. Doglike
head. Swollen abdomen. Four needle-sharp
hooks on its tail.
PARAGUAYAN BARKING SNAKE 417
Behavior: Barks like a dog.
Distribution: Upper Rio Parana, Paraguay.
Significant sighting: In February 1972, gov-
ernment surveyors brought a specimen of this
snake from the jungle to the Botanical and Zo-
ological Garden in Asuncion, where it was kept.
Probable explanation: Journalistic misunder-
standing and mistranslation of the term Mboi-
yagua as “dog snake” instead of “tiger snake,”
the Guarani Indian name for the Anaconda ( Eu -
nectes murinus). The specimen caught was preg-
nant, hence the swollen abdomen.

version of a Dev.
Variant name: Peri.
Significant sighting: Said to have been used in
army combat units during the Avestan age

Parker’s Snake
Unknown SNAKE of Australasia.
Physical description: Length, up to 6 feet.
Smooth scales. Enlarged ventrals. Short tail.
Behavior: Aquatic. Very venomous.
Habitat: Small freshwater swamps and inland
streams.
Distribution: Western Province, Papua New
Guinea.
Significant sightings: In 1972 and 1973, one
of these snakes bit three children near the village
of Wipim, Papua New Guinea. All three
quickly died, faster than most victims of bites by
Taipans ( Oxyuranus spp.) or Sea snakes {Hy-
drophis spp.).

Partridge Creek Beast
DlNOSAUR-like animal of northwestern Canada.
Physical description: Length, 50 feet. Esti-
mated weight, 40 tons. Black. Immense jaws.
One rhinoceros-like horn on its snout. Skin has
grayish-black bristles like those of a wild boar.
Two powerful hind legs.
Behavior: Bipedal. Roars loudly. Eats caribou.
Tracks: Footprints, 5 feet long and 2 feet 6
inches wide. Claw marks, 1 foot long. Creates a
furrow 12 feet wide and 2 feet deep. Tail im-
pression, 1 0 feet long and 1 6 inches wide.
Habitat: Rocky gorge.
Distribution: Partridge Creek, Klondike area,
Yukon Territory.
Significant sightings: In 1903, James Lewis
Buttler and Tom Leemore were hunting moose
near the mouth of Clear Creek, Yukon Terri-
tory, when the three animals they were stalking
suddenly took off running as if in a great fright.
After discovering the tracks of a huge animal
that had left a furrow in the mud 2 feet deep,
they followed the trail across country for 6 miles
until it disappeared into a gorge at Partridge
Creek. Returning to the Armstrong Creek set-
tlement on the McQuesten River, they met
Georges Dupuy, Fr. Pierre Lavagneux, and five
Indians, and all decided to head out the next
day to look for the animal. After a day’s unsuc-
cessful search, they got a good look at it for
more than ten minutes when it came close to
their campsite near Partridge Creek.
Lavagneux claimed to have seen the animal
again on December 24, 1907, in the same area
when the temperature was -45°F. It was carry-
ing a caribou carcass in its teeth and left tracks
identical to those seen in 1903.
Present status: These are the only known re-
ports.
Possible explanations:
418 PARE
(1) Father Lavagneux identified the animal
as a ceratosaurus, a 20- to 30-foot theropod
dinosaur with a short nasal horn that had
been discovered in Colorado in 1883.
However, because of the inhospitable, sub-
Arctic climate in the Yukon, it’s hard to see
how even the most warm-blooded of
dinosaurs could survive a winter there.
(2) A tall tale concocted around the fossil
discovery twenty-five years earlier. The well-
publicized reconstructions of and theories
about ceratosaurus by Othniel C. Marsh in
the 1880s and 1890s made this dinosaur
widely known to the general public.

Passenger Pigeon
Formerly superabundant Bird of the Dove fam-
ily (Columbidae) in the central and eastern
United States, presumed extinct since 1914.
Scientific name: Ectopistes migratorius, given
by Carl von Linne in 1766.
Physical description: Length, 16 inches. Blue-
gray head, neck, back, and wings. Cinnamon-
pink underparts. Long tail.
Behavior: Flocks of millions of pigeons used
to fill the sky, blocking out the sunlight, roaring
like a locomotive, and flying nearly 60 miles an
hour for hours at a time. One flock moving be-
tween Kentucky and Indiana in the early 1800s
The PASSENGER pigeon ( Ectopistes migratorius),
presumed extinct since 1914. (© 2002 ArtToday.com,
Inc., an IMSI Company)
was estimated as 1 mile wide and 240 miles
long.
Distribution: Scattered sightings in northern
Michigan, West Virginia, and New Jersey.
Significant sightings: On October 26, 1907,
A. B. Elbon, of Webster Springs, West Virginia,
reported a flock of about 500 pigeons on Elk
Mountain.
On June 10, 1929, Robert H. Wright ob-
served a pair of birds at close range on Highway
M-28, 16 miles from Munising, Michigan.
Bacteriologist Philip Hadley and a friend
were hunting in the Upper Peninsula of Michi-
gan in September 1929 when they saw a Pas-
senger pigeon perched nearby. It took flight im-
mediately. They were certain of its identity,
since they had seen these pigeons in their youth.
Two sightings in 1965 at Homer, Michigan,
and Park Ridge, New Jersey, were probably
mourning doves.
Present status: The most numerous of all birds
on Earth in the early nineteenth century, the
Passenger pigeon was hunted relentlessly until
the last individual, Martha, a female at the
PASSENGER PIGEON 419
Cincinnati Zoo, died on September 1, 1914.
The last major nestings were on the eastern
shore of Lake Michigan in 1881 and in Wis-
consin in 1882. The last confirmed wild speci-
men was killed near Sargents, Ohio, by four-
teen-year-old Press Clay Southworth on March
24, 1900.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Mourning dove ( Zenaida macrourd)
is similar but only 12 inches long and a
duller gray-brown.
(2) The Band-tailed pigeon ( Columba
fasciata ) may have been misidentified in
western states.

Giant Hominid of South America.
Etymology: The size of these animals caused
explorer Ferdinand Magellan to name them
Patagones (Portuguese, “big foot”) and their
country Patagonia.
Variant name: Chaucahue (possibly Huil-
liche/Araucanian) .
Physical description: Height said to be 7-12
feet.
Behavior: Nomadic, following the wild herds
of Guanaco ( Lama guanicoe ), their primary
source of food.
Distribution: Southern Argentina and Chile.
Significant sightings: In June 1520, the expe-
dition of Ferdinand Magellan encountered giant
Indians at Puerto San Julian, Santa Cruz
Province, Argentina.
In June 1578, Francis Drake’s men brawled
with the Puerto San Julian Indians, noting they
were not as tall as Magellan’s chronicler had in-
dicated.
Sebald de Weert in 1598, Joris van Spilber-
gen and Wilhelm Schouten in 1615, John
Byron in 1764, and other visitors also encoun-
tered Indians of large stature.
Probable explanation: The Tehuelche Indians,
whose height was exaggerated by clothing and
long hair. In 1983, the last thirty or so remain-
ing Tehuelche lived on a small reserve at Ca-
mashu Aike, Santa Cruz Province, Argentina.

Patagonian Plesiosaur
Freshwater Monster of Argentina.
Physical description: Long neck like a swan’s,
held high above the water.
Behavior: Nocturnal. Can travel on land.
Distribution: The lake region of Chubut
Province, Argentina, including Lago Blanco; the
adjacent region of Chile.
Significant sightings: The director of the
Jardin Zoologico at Buenos Aires, Clemente
Onelli, interviewed a farmer who lived on Lago
Blanco in 1897 about strange, nocturnal noises
heard along the lake’s pebbly shore. A long-
necked animal could sometimes be seen on
moonlit nights.
On October 18, 1921, prospector Martin
420 PATAGONIAN GIANT
Sheffield came across the tracks of a large animal
west of Esquel, Argentina, and followed them to
an unnamed mountain lake where he saw a ple-
siosaur-like animal swimming.
Onelli organized an expedition, led by Jose
Cihagi and Emilio Frey, that set out to investi-
gate these reports on March 23, 1922. On April
18, despite some bureaucratic problems with
permits, the group reached the lake where
Sheffield had seen the animal but did not find
anything (despite setting off some dynamite in
the lake); the group was forced to return to
Buenos Aires on April 26 before the southern
winter set in.
Possible explanation: The Giant otter
(. Pteronura brasiliensis) is found much farther
north, though there is a historical record of its
existence from Uruguay. It grows to a length of
6 feet, including the tail.

Patagonian Unicorn
UNICORN-like animal of South America.
Distribution: Southern Argentina.
Significant sighting: A single-horned, horse-
like animal is said to be depicted in two cave
paintings in the Lago Posadas area, Santa Cruz
Province, Argentina. Manuel Palacios told
Bruce Chatwin that these animals were hunted
to extinction in the fifth or sixth millennium
B.C.

Patty
Female BlGFOOT caught on film by Roger Pat-
terson and Robert Gimlin in 1967 near Bluff
Creek, California.
Etymology: Nicknamed by Dmitri Bayanov
after cameraman Roger Patterson.
Scientific name: Homo troglodytes pattersoni,
given in 1997 by Bayanov.
Physical description: Height estimates range
from 6 feet 2 inches (Gimlin’s) to 7 feet 4 inches
(Patterson’s). Based on the size of the tracks
found, a chest width has been estimated at 22
inches, with a depth of 16 inches. Weight esti-
mates based on the film range from 280 to
2,030 pounds, but if the chest measurements
are accurate, the weight would be roughly 540
pounds. Massive upper body. Covered with
short, shiny black hair. Head set low below
shoulders. Sagittal crest (usually a male primate
characteristic). Bare, grayish skin on parts of the
face. Heavy browridge. Deep-set eyes. Wide
nose. Short neck. Prominent, hair-covered
breasts. Soles of feet are bare and light in color.
Behavior: Humanlike gait, with arms swing-
ing. Foul odor.
Tracks: Ten prints of both feet, 14.5 inches
long by 6 inches wide, were found in the creek
bed. Stride, 40-42 inches.
Location: Bluff Creek, just north of its con-
fluence with Notice Creek, in the Six Rivers Na-
tional Forest, southeastern Del Norte County,
California.
Significant sighting: Around 1 :20 P.M. on Oc-
tober 20, 1967, retired rodeo rider and horse
breeder Roger Patterson and his friend Robert
Gimlin were riding along Bluff Creek in north-
ern California looking for BlGFOOT tracks. As
they rode around a bend, they saw a female
crouching by the creek. Their horses reared up,
and Patterson’s pony fell on its side. He scram-
bled clear and managed to pull his leased 16-
millimeter Cine-Kodak K-100 home-movie
camera out of the saddlebag. Gimlin covered
the animal with his 30.06 rifle in case it tried to
attack. The creature watched them briefly be-

female BlGFOOT nicknamed PATTY. (Rene Dahinden/Fortean Picture Library)
fore it walked away at a deliberate pace across a
sandbar. Meanwhile, Patterson ran after it and
started filming, though he lost his balance once
as he crossed the creek. This portion of the film
turned out blurred and jerky, and he neglected
to note the film speed. When he got a clear
view, he stopped running and held the camera
steady. At the same time, the Bigfoot turned its
upper body sideways briefly to look at him, then
moved off into the brush. Patterson kept film-
ing for a while, though trees were in the way.
After running out of film, he reloaded; then the
men both tried following the tracks but lost the
trail about 150 feet beyond the film site. Patter-
son took some footage of the tracks along the
creek, but this has apparently been lost.
Forester Lyle Laverty took photos of the
tracks the following day after a rainstorm, and
taxidermist Bob Titmus visited the site on Oc-
tober 29 and made ten plaster casts of both right
and left footprints. He was able to follow the
trail and found some body impressions indicat-
ing that after the incident, Patty had sat down in
some ferns about 125-150 yards away, perhaps
watching the men.
Present status: The film consists of more than
23 feet of color footage (952 frames). The pri-
mary stumbling block is that the film speed of
the camera was not noted at the time. The
Kodak was adjustable to run at variable speeds.
Patterson normally shot at 24 frames per second
(fps), but sometime after the incident, he noted
the camera was set on 18 fps. This may have
been Patterson’s misreading of 16 fps, since
there is apparently no setting for 18 fps on the
K-100 model. In any case, the adjustment may
have occurred accidentally when he pulled the
camera out of the saddlebag.
Biomechanics expert Donald W. Grieve
pointed out in December 1971 that the crea-
ture’s observable muscular movements are
seemingly natural and would be difficult to fake,
especially with the breadth of its shoulders. He
said even a large human could probably not
match the gait if the film speed was 16 or 18 fps.
In October 1972, Russian researchers Dmitri
Bayanov and Igor Bourtsev correlated the
bounces in the film with the steps taken by Pat-
terson, concluding that the film speed must
Cast of a Bigfoot track found at the Patterson film site
in 1967. (Loren Coleman)
have been 16 fps or Patterson would have been
sprinting along at an unlikely speed.
Opinion is strongly divided on whether Patty
looks plausibly real or is an improbable mix of
human and ape characteristics. In 1973, prima-
tologist John Napier wrote that, although he
“could not see the zipper,” the creature didn’t
make sense to him because its upper half is ape-
like and its legs and gait are humanlike. He also
pointed out Patty’s odd blend of both male
(crest) and female (breasts) primate features.
In 1975, Peter Byrne noted that the time
(Friday) and location of the sighting make a
hoax improbable. In 1967, the rough road
(since collapsed) near the creek was a popular
PATTY 423

film taken by Roger Patterson in 1967. (Rene Dahinden/
Fortean Picture Library)
route for weekend campers and Bigfoot hunters.
A hoax party could be too easily surprised by a
pickup coming down the road, and the specific
spot has open visibility from the south, north,
and west. The noise of the creek itself would
mask the sounds made by unexpected hunters
or hikers. A man in a Bigfoot suit would be tak-
ing unnecessary risks by exposing himself to
trigger-happy backpackers eager to bag the big
prize. There are many sites farther upstream that
offer a more convenient setting for hoax prepa-
rations (footprints) and the event itself.
Anthropologist Grover Krantz observed in
1992 that sagittal crests in apes are a function of
size, not gender, and exist to anchor the massive
jaws of the larger males.
Krantz also concluded that the sequence had
been filmed at 18 fps, based on his estimate of
the speed of the stride as measured by the swing-
ing of the arms and the legs, and determined
that it correlated with the reported height of
6-7 feet. At 24 fps, the subject would have been
less than 4 feet tall; at 16 fps, it would have been
well over 7 feet. In 1999, he found out that the
settings on the K-100 model were only approx-
imate (within 1 0 percent of the setting, accord-
ing to Kodak); a camera set to 16 fps was elec-
tronically timed at 1 9 fps, or three frames faster.
The allegation that Patterson was perma-
nently employed as a cameraman for American
National Enterprises in Salt Lake City and com-
missioned to create a Bigfoot film is, at best, un-
substantiated. The charge was made in the Fox-
TV special entitled “World’s Greatest Hoaxes:
Secrets Finally Revealed,” which aired on De-
cember 28, 1998.
Cliff Crook and Chris Murphy claim to be
able to see a metal latch on the torso, while Erik
Beckjord says he has found a metal tube on
Patty’s arm. Neither of these objects have been
identified by other analysts.
Possible explanations:
(1) A man in a suit made by the late
Hollywood special-effects artist John
Chambers, who created the makeup and
suits for the 1968 Planet of the Apes movie.
Mark Chorvinsky has gathered considerable
evidence to show that it was a common
assumption in the makeup community of
the late 1960s that Chambers was
responsible. However, on October 26,
1997, Chambers denied to investigator
Bobbie Short that he ever made or designed
a suit used for the Patterson film.
(2) A hoax perpetrated by Patterson and
Gimlin.
(3) A hoax perpetrated by Patterson and an
unknown associate on Gimlin.
(4) A hoax played on both Patterson and
Gimlin by unknown persons.
(5) If genuine, the film is one of the best
pieces of evidence for the existence of a large
unknown hominid in North America.

Peel Street Monster
Mystery RODENT-like animal of central England.
Physical description: Like a rat but much
larger.
Behavior: Aggressive. Attacks and bites children.
Distribution: Peel Street and Brickkiln Street,
Wolverhampton, England.
Significant sighting: During the winter of
1933-1934, several children were attacked by a
bizarre creature in Wolverhampton. It was put
out of commission with a brick wielded by sev-
enteen-year-old Georgie Goodhead on January
18, 1934, as it was about to attack a five-year-
old child. Locals stood around and kicked it
until it was dead. Naturalists who were called in
to examine it allegedly could not identify it,
other than to say it was male. The following
day, a female coati was found dead in the area,
PEEL STREET MONSTER 425

Peist
Water Horse or Freshwater Monster of
Ireland.
Etymology: Irish, “monster,” “reptile,” or
“worm.” From the Latin pestis, “pest, bane.” Also
said to derive from the Latin bestia (“beast”).
Variant names: Eel-horse, Horse-eel, Muir-
dris, Oillepheist, Oillipheist (“great monster”),
Payshtha more, Peiste, Piast, Smach, Uilebheist
(Scots Gaelic), Uilepheist, WURRUM.
Physical description: Eel-like. Horse’s head.
Distribution: Lakes and rivers in Ireland and
Scotland. Also said to live in the sea, especially
along the coast of Scotland and the Orkney Is-
lands.
Significant sighting: The Oillipheist is said to
have cut the route of the Shannon River when it
heard that St. Patrick had come to drive it out
of the land.

Peninsula Python
Giant Snake of Ohio.
Physical description: Length, 15-19 feet.
Dark, with brownish blotches.
Behavior: Can climb trees. Rears up like a
cobra. Raids henhouses.
Tracks: Width of an automobile tire.
Distribution: Northeastern Ohio.
Significant sightings: Clarence Mitchell saw an
1 8-foot snake crawling across his cornfield near
Peninsula, Ohio, on June 8, 1944. After several
days of effort, a posse that had been formed on
June 25 failed to find any evidence other than
broken branches and trails leading to the Cuya-
hoga River. Reports of a large snake were made
through August 1 by other residents of the val-
ley, including Pauline Hopko, who said it slith-
ered away from a willow tree in her yard and
frightened her cows so much that they broke
loose and ran away.
Possible explanation: An escaped snake from a
carnival truck that supposedly crashed in the
area around 1934.

Persepolis Beast
Mystery HOOFED MAMMAL of East Africa.
Physical description: Small, robust, giraffelike
animal. Ears short and small. Maned neck
longer than an okapi’s but shorter than a gi-
raffe’s. Cloven hooves.
Significant sighting: A giraffelike animal is de-
picted in a bas-relief in the Apadana Palace of
King Darius of Persia, erected around 500 B.C.
in the city of Persepolis (Takht-e Jamsld, near
Marv Dasht, Iran). The carving is on the side of
the eastern staircase. It shows an animal led on
a tether by a delegation of Ethiopians paying
tribute to the Persian king.
Possible explanations:
(1) A Giraffe ( Girajfa Camelopardalis) . The
tail is right, and the horns are in the correct
position, though they are short and pointed.
In profile, the face is like a giraffe’s.
However, the body is too heavy, the limbs
and neck are too short, the toes are too
large, and the ears are small and short. The
sculptor might never have seen a giraffe and
perhaps was improvising; there was also a
limited amount of space on the staircase to
portray a long neck.
(2) An Okapi ( Okapia johnstoni ) was
suggested by B. Patterson in 1953, though
426 PEIST
this elusive creature is extremely difficult to
transport and maintain in captivity. Also,
the neck is too long proportionately for an
okapi.
(3) A Nilgai ( Boselaphus tragocamelus) , an
Indian antelope, matches many features
(horns, ears, mane, tail) of the bas-relief.
Raul Valdez and Robert Tuck suggest that
the African delegates purchased a local
Asian animal for tribute. Gunther Sehm
notes that nilgai bones are known from Late
Pleistocene middens in Jordan and that the
Ethiopian delegation might actually have
come from the Red Sea coast of Arabia,
where the animals could have persisted until
2,500 years ago.
(4) A surviving Palaeotragus , a genus of
okapi-like giraffids that lived in Turkey in
the Late Miocene, 7 million years ago,
suggested by Nikos Solunias.

Significant sightings: During the New Rich-
mond, Wisconsin, tornado of June 12, 1899, a
kangaroo was seen running through a woman’s
backyard. Although a circus was in town, appar-
ently no kangaroos were accompanying it.
On January 13 and 14, 1934, a giant kanga-
roo reportedly killed and ate some police dogs in
Hamburg, Tennessee. Rev. W. J. Hancock saw
it running and leaping across a field.
On July 28, 1958, Charles Wetzel saw a deer-
like animal chasing some dogs by his cabin on
the Platte River near Grand Island, Nebraska.
When he got within 1 0 yards of it, he realized it
was a kangaroo. It bounded away into an alfalfa
field, taking 10-foot leaps. Wetzel, who oper-
ated a brewery, was so taken with the experience
that he named one of his beer brands “Wetzel
Kangaroo Beer.”
Chicago policemen Leonard Ciagi and
Michael Byrne encountered a 5-foot kangaroo
in the early morning of October 18, 1974, in a
dark alley on the northwest side of the city.
When Ciagi tried to handcuff it, the animal
kicked him hard in the legs before it escaped by
leaping over a fence.
After more than two weeks of mysterious
kangaroo sightings in the Waukesha, Wiscon-
sin, area, two men took a blurry Polaroid pho-
tograph of a kangaroo they saw in the bush near
Pewaukee on April 24, 1978. Loren Coleman
says it resembles a Red-necked wallaby (. Macro-
pus rufogriseus) or Swamp wallaby ( Wallabia bi-
color). Years later, an unconfirmed story sur-
faced that the two men were taxidermists who
had taken a photo of a stuffed wallaby.
In early June 1981, Ray Ault was tending
sheep near Cedar Fort, Utah, when he saw a big,
yellowish kangaroo jump past his herd.
On August 4, 1999, Lois Eckhardt saw a kan-
garoo-like animal with a long tail on her cattle
farm near Wellman, Iowa.
In October 2000, there were four sightings of
a 6-foot kangaroo nibbling on leaves in Becken-
ham Place Park, near Lewisham, London.
Possible explanations:
(1) Zoo escapees, such as a Kinkajou ( Potos
flavus ), Mara (Dolichotis s pp.), Civet
(Viverrinae), or an actual Kangaroo (Family
Macropodidae), have been suggested as
candidates and occasionally caught.
(2) The raccoonlike White-nosed coati
( Nasua narica ) often carries its long tail
erect as it runs, though it is seen more often
in bands rather than alone. Its range is
limited to Arizona, New Mexico, and
Mexico.

Phantom Wolf
Mystery DOG-like ENTITY of the midwestern
and eastern United States.
Variant names: Booger dog, Phantom dog,
Witchie wolf (Ojibwa/Algonquian).
Physical description: Large dog of varying de-
scriptions.
Behavior: Held responsible for livestock
depredations.
Distribution: Michigan; Ohio; Illinois; Mis-
souri; Louisiana; Pennsylvania; Connecticut;
Maine.
Significant sightings:]. Gordon was crossing a
mountain stream on horseback one night near
Bunker, Missouri, when a huge dog came walk-
ing along the stream and jumped up on his
horse. He fired two rounds into it and hit it
with his pistol, apparently to no effect, since it
was a phantom.
On July 27, 1994, Jerry D. Coleman and
four others watched a large, wild dog, 3 feet
high at the shoulder and with a long, thin tail,
in a field on the north side of Elgin, Illinois.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Gray wolf ( Canis lupus) usually
hunts in packs for large prey. Its average
length is 5 feet from head to tail, and its
coat varies from white to black, with many
shades in between. Wolf predation on cattle
and sheep in the United States is negligible.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service gives the
following numbers for verified wolf kills
from 1991 through May 1998 in
Minnesota, a state with an estimated wolf
population of 2,400: 585 cattle, 200 sheep,
10 horses, 3 pigs, 5 goats, 4,889 turkeys, 30
chickens, 7 geese, 2 ducks, and 84 dogs.
Pawprints are not reliable indicators of a
wolf kill, since wolf prints can be
indistinguishable from those of large dogs.
Wolf predation is likely if there are bites
and large, jagged wounds on flanks,
hindquarters, and upper shoulders of large
livestock or bites on the head, neck, throat,
back, and hindquarters of sheep and calves.
Wolves will also eat most of a carcass unless
they are interrupted.
(2) The Coyote ( Canis latrans ), the most
widely distributed North American canid,
differs from the gray wolf in its much
smaller overall size (4 feet from head to tail),
feet, and head. The upper parts are grizzled
buff and grayish, overlaid with black; its
muzzle, ears, and the outer sides of its legs
are yellowish buff; and its tail has a black tip.
It most often hunts alone or in pairs, usually
at night because of human persecution. Its
reputation as a major killer of domestic
livestock is, to a large extent, unwarranted,
since it feeds primarily on rabbits and
rodents. Injured coyotes are more likely to
prey on poultry, sheep, and goats.
(3) Feral Domestic dogs ( Canis familiaris)
can easily be mistaken for wolves and
coyotes.
(4) A hybrid gray wolf x domestic dog
(usually a German shepherd, malamute, or
husky). These hybrids are often very
territorial, have a strong pack instinct, and
prefer a roaming life.
(5) A male coyote x female domestic dog
hybrid. Coydogs become more aggressive
when they mature but are generally timid
toward humans. They show clear signs of
both parents, are fertile, and can bark like
domestic dogs. Though rare, they do tend
to be more aggressive toward livestock than
wild coyotes.

Phoenix
Mythical Bird of West Asia and North Africa
that regenerates itself from its own ashes.
Etymology : From the Greek phoinix, probably
in reference to Phoenicia. The Greeks called the
Date palm (. Phoenix dactyliferd) phoinix, since
the Phoenicians were said to have cultivated it.
The term is apparently unrelated to the Greek
phoinos, “blood red.” The word may also derive
from the Egyptian benu, the BENNU Bird.
Variant name: Fenix.
Physical description: Size of an eagle. Crest on
top of head. Jewel-like eyes. Emerald-green neck
with a ring of gold feathers. Multicolored breast.
Crimson wings. Red, gold, brown, and purple
tail feathers.
Behavior: Said to be a single animal with a life
cycle between 500 to 12,994 years. At the end
of the cycle, the Phoenix gathers myrrh, cinna-
mon, and other herbs to line its nest; then the
sun ignites the concoction and burns the bird to
ashes. At night, a worm emerges from the ashes
and grows into a birdlike shape that spreads its
wings and takes flight at dawn. Said to have
flown to the solar temple at Heliopolis in Egypt
to place its egg on the altar, construct a new
nest, and begin the cycle again. Its call is sweet
and melodious. Said to feed on rare herbs.
Distribution: India; Arabia; Ethiopia; Egypt.
Significant sightings: A Phoenix was report-
edly seen in Heliopolis, Egypt, in the sixth and
the third centuries B.C.
Another Phoenix was put on display in Rome
in A.D. 34 or 47.
Possible explanations:
(1) Imported Bird of paradise (Family
Paradisaeidae) feathers from New Guinea
may have been attributed to the Phoenix.
These birds were officially discovered in the
sixteenth century by Ferdinand Magellan
but were probably known centuries earlier.
The Roman emperor Heliogabalus (A.D.
2 1 8-222) is said to have dined on birds of
paradise. New Guinea natives may have
been exporting feathers and skins to
Phoenicia as long ago as 1000 B.C. The
skins were kept in an egg-shaped container,
covered with myrrh and enclosed in a parcel
of burnt banana leaves.
(2) Count Raggi’s bird of paradise
( Paradisaea raggiana) has an extraordinary
mating display in which it expands and
deflates its red plumage as if it were dancing
in the midst of red flames.
(3) The male Common peafowl or Peacock
( Pavo cristatus ), native to India, has a
spectacular set of 150 multicolored train
feathers that are raised in a half-circular fan
when strutting in front of a female.
(4) The Salamander has been confused
with the Phoenix, since it was also thought
to live in fire.
(5) The Greater flamingo ( Phoenicopterus
ruber) has fiery-pink plumage and is found
in various parts of Africa and the Middle
East.
(6) A stray Golden pheasant ( Chrysolophus
pictud) from China. Adult males have a full,
silky-golden crest, while the face, throat,
and neck are rusty tan. The upper back is
green, and the rest of the back and rump is
a golden-yellow. The breast is scarlet; the
flanks and underparts are scarlet fading into
a light chestnut. The central tail feathers
and upper tail coverts are black, spotted
with cinnamon.
(7) The Egyptian BENNU Bird, the sacred
heron of Osiris and a symbol of
resurrection, is closely associated with the
Phoenix, and the Greeks certainly thought
they were the same creature. However, the
Phoenix is not particularly heronlike.
(8) An exotic Parrot (Family Psittacidae),
perhaps imported from Southeast Asia.
(9) Some birds engage in “anting,” a vigorous
and apparently recreational rubbing of the
plumage with ants or acrid substances. Some
250 species indulge in this activity, which
often consists of the bird settling down on an
430 PHOENIX
anthill, spreading its wings, and allowing ants
to swarm through its feathers. Angry ants
emit formic acid, which may help repel
parasites inhabiting a bird’s feathers.
However, some birds also engage in similar
behavior with the smoke from burning
leaves, cigarettes, or matches. Maurice
Burton suggested that ancient observations of
this peculiar behavior may have given rise to
the legend of a bird reborn in fire. It is even
possible that the priests of Heliopolis
encouraged smoke-related anting in temple
birds as part of their solar rituals.

Phoenix (Chinese)
Mythical Bird of East Asia. One of the four sa-
cred animals of Chinese mythology.
Variant names: Feng-huang (Chinese/Sino-
Tibetan), U-feng.
Physical description: The plumage consists of
the five fundamental colors of black, white, red,
green, and yellow. The head is like a pheasant’s
or rooster’s. Large beak like a parrot’s. Back like
a tortoise’s. Body like a mandarin duck’s. The
male is said to have three legs. Long tufts of dis-
play feathers are like a peacock’s. In more recent
accounts, the creature has a snake’s head, a tor-
toise’s shell, and a fishlike tail.
Behavior: Gentle. Lands from flight very
lightly. Enjoys dancing and human communal
behavior. Its call encompasses the five tones of
the Chinese pentatonic scale.
Distribution: Guangdong Province and
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China.
Significant sightings: When it first appeared in
the reign of the legendary emperor Huangdi
around 2600 B.C., the Chinese Phoenix was a
deity associated with the wind. The shape of the
Chinese character feng in the twelfth century
B.C. resembled both a bird of paradise and the
character representing the wind, implying a
close association. The Phoenix later came to
represent the union of yin and yang, with the
male bird (Feng) and the female bird (Huang)
as symbols of cosmic harmony. The Feng is
mentioned in a commentary from the fourth
century B.C. as an omen of the country being
ruled by a good king. Later, the Phoenix came
PHOENIX (CHINESE) 431
to symbolize the empress, while the DRAGON
stood for the emperor.
Possible explanations:
(1) Based on imported feathers of Birds of
paradise (Family Paradisaeidae) from New
Guinea.
(2) A Bird of paradise that lived in ancient
China. Tzu-Chiang Chou presents some
evidence that as recently as the Southern
Song Dynasty (1127-1279), southern
China was home to two native species of
bird of paradise, now extinct. Chou claims
the Feng-huang, a bird with long red
plumes said to have lived in Guangdong
during the Southern Song, might be the
Red bird of paradise ( Paradisaea rubra), the
Goldie’s bird of paradise (P. decora), or
Count Raggi’s bird of paradise {P.
raggiana), though they are known only in
Papua New Guinea. The crested U-feng or
Black phoenix, said to be bluish-green and
purple, lived in Guangxi Zhuang at the
same time and might be the Black sicklebill
( Epimachus fastuosus). However, there is no
evidence that birds of paradise existed
anywhere outside Australasia. (The only
exception is the imported Greater bird of
paradise [P. apoda) , which lived on Little
Tobago in the Caribbean from 1909 to
1963, when it failed to survive Hurricane
Flora.) Live specimens brought to China
from New Guinea are a more likely
explanation, according to Karl Shuker.
(3) The Common peafowl ( Pavo cristatus),
native to India. See PHOENIX.
(4) The Crested argus ( Rheinartia ocellatd),
a large pheasant with a huge tail, is found in
Vietnam and Malaysia. It has some of the
longest feathers of any wild bird, often
reaching 5 feet 8 inches long.

Physical description: Hairy. Human face. Big
feet.
Distribution: Texas.

Piasa
Legendary Bird depicted in a petroglyph on a
bluff by the Mississippi River in Illinois.
Etymology: Illini (Algonquian) word of un-
known derivation. Similar to the Cree (Algon-
quian) piyesiw (“thunderbird”) and the Ojibwa
(Algonquian) binesi (“large bird”). In Kickapoo
(Algonquian), peisa means “cat”; to the Miami
and Peoria (Algonquian), paisa means “dwarf,”
while to the Meskawki (Algonquian), paia’shi-
wuk were LITTLE PEOPLE. An alternative sugges-
tion is from the French paillissa (“palisade”),
meaning the bluffs along the Mississippi River.
Variant names: Blue bird (Creek/Musko-
gean), Hu-huk (Pawnee/Caddoan), Piesa,
Storm bird.
432 PI
PIASA BIRD
The PlASA, a legendary bird formerly depicted in a petroglyph on a bluff along the Mississippi River in Illinois. (From a
postcard in the author’s collection)
Physical description: Length, 1 6 feet. Covered
with scales. Antlers. Bearlike face. Glowing red
eyes. Large teeth. Bearded. Batlike wings. Eagle-
like claws. A long, forked tail.
Behavior: Has a preference for human meat.
Powerful enough to carry away a deer in its talons.
Distribution: Mississippi River bluffs near
Alton, Illinois.
Significant sightings: The Piasa bird was said
to have been killed by the Illinois chief Ouatoga
(with the help of twenty warriors) and com-
memorated in a petroglyph that existed in 1673
when Jacques Marquette and Louis Joliet visited
the area. The petroglyph was carved into the
rock a half inch or more and was painted red,
black, and blue.
A Big Bird that looked like a naval torpedo
was seen flying at a height of 500 feet over
Alton, Illinois, on April 24, 1948, by E. M.
Coleman and his son. Sightings continued over
St. Louis, Missouri, during the following week.
Present status: The original petroglyph has long
been eradicated, partly because of both the Indi-
ans’ and the whites’ habit of using it for target
practice. It apparently had disappeared by 1867.
No reliable sketch has survived. In 1924, Herbert
Forcade painted his conception of the Piasa on
the bluffs where a sand plant now operates on the
600 block of West Broadway, but the image was
blasted away in the 1 960s to make room for con-
struction of the Great River Road. A 3-ton metal
replica of the Piasa was mounted on the bluffs
near Norman’s Landing, 2 miles west of Alton, in
1983, but it was removed in 1995. The Piasa’s
latest manifestation is a 48-foot x 22-foot paint-
ing on the bluffs completed by the American Leg-
ends Society and many volunteers in 1998. Piasa
Park, opened in 2001, surrounds the painting
and offers an interpretive center.
Possible explanations:
(1) A surviving rhamphorynchid (a fossil
flying reptile), proposed by Perry
Armstrong. Rhamphorynchus was a long-
tailed pterosaur that lived in Europe and
Africa during the Late Jurassic, 150 million
years ago.

Pictish Beast
Unknown FRESHWATER MONSTER depicted on
rock carvings in Scotland.
Physical description: An animal with charac-
teristics resembling both a swimming elephant
and a dolphin. Elongated beak or trunk. The
head has a crest that may be a stylized way to
show a porpoise spouting. Flippers. Tail has a
curled tip.
Distribution: Rodney’s Stone, at Dyke, in
Moray; Brough of Birsay in the Orkney Islands;
the Dunfallandy Stone, in Perth and Kinross;
the Maiden Stone, near Pitcaple, Aberdeenshire;
Port Elphinstone Henge, near Inverurie, Ab-
erdeenshire; the Rhynie Piet Stones, Aberdeen-
shire; Aberlemno, Angus.
Significant sightings: The Piets were wild
tribes that lived in Scotland during Roman
times. They carved about fifty different types of
symbols into rough stone and rocky outcrops,
many dating from the sixth century and earlier.
One of these symbols is the Pictish beast.
Possible explanations:
(1) A Dolphin (Family Delphinidae) or
Porpoise (Family Phocoenidae), based on the
shape of its head and a stylized spout.
However, it has legs and a tail without flukes.
(2) A swimming elephant, based on the
trunk.
(3) A Celtic Kelpie or Water Horse,
suggested by Elizabeth Sutherland.

Pink Alligator
Odd Crocodilian of Florida.
Physical description: Pink color.
Distribution: Everglades, Florida.
Significant sighting: Tour guide Danny
Decker twice encountered a pink alligator in a
canal near Andytown, Florida, in early March
1976.
Possible explanations:
(1) Albinistic (pink-eyed) or leucistic (dark-
eyed) Alligators ( Alligator mississippiensis) are
white but could appear pink under certain
lighting conditions.
(2) The Spectacled caiman ( Caiman
crocodilus) has been introduced and is
thriving in Dade County, Florida.
Hatchlings are yellowish but turn darker in
adulthood.

Pink Dolphin
Odd-colored CETACEAN of the western Pacific
Ocean.
Variant name: Chinese white dolphin.
Physical description: Juveniles are born black,
then turn light gray as they get older. Adults are
whitish pink, with gray spots or patches. The
dorsal fin is slightly larger in this variety, though
it lacks the pronounced hump of the African
populations.
Distribution: Zhu Jiang River estuary between
Hong Kong and Macau, China.
Present status: Known as long ago as A.D.
618-907 in Tang Dynasty poetry. About
100-200 Pink dolphins are found in Hong
Kong waters; as many as 1,000 are estimated to
live in the entire estuary.
Probable explanation: Definitely a local color
variation of the Indo-Pacific hump-backed dol-
phin ( Sousa chinensis ), found in coastal waters
from South Africa to eastern Australia. The rea-
son for its light coloration is unknown.

chased by a 50-foot animal as he crossed the
North Saskatchewan River in 1939.
Some boys swimming in the river on July 22,
1942, saw a long, loglike object in a pool under
the bridge. They began to throw stones at it,
whereupon it came to life and moved toward
the shore. It stopped halfway on the shore and
thrashed its long tail in the water.

Pink-Headed Duck
Distinctive water Bird of the Indian subconti-
nent, presumed extinct since the 1930s.
PINK-HEADED DUCK 435
Scientific name: Rhodonessa caryophyllacea ,
given by John Latham in 1790.
Physical description: Length, 2 feet. Male has
pink head and bill and a dark-brown body. Fe-
male has a grayish-pink head. Pinkish underwing.
Habitat: Wetlands.
Distribution: Northern and northeastern
India; Nepal; Bangladesh; northern Myanmar.
Present status: The last official wild specimen
may have been an individual spotted in June
1936 near Darbhanga, Bihar State, India. Ex-
ported specimens may have survived into the
1940s in a private collection of waterfowl at
Foxwarren Park, Surrey, England.
Significant sightings: L. P. Singh shot a Pink-
headed duck on January 27, 1947, at Manroopa
Lake, Bihar State, India. He saw five to eight
ducks there over the next two years.
Game warden K. L. Mehta observed a male
Pink-headed duck February 28-29, 1960, in a
pond in Haryana State about 40 miles south of
Simla, India.
In 1998, the Wildlife and Wetlands Trust
sponsored an expedition to Tibet undertaken by
Peter Gladstone and Charles Martell from the
United Kingdom. Tibetan Forestry Department
staff had reported Pink-headed ducks surviving
in a remote region to the north of Bhutan, but
the expedition did not locate any birds.
Possible explanation: The male Red-crested
pochard ( Netta rufind) has a rusty-orange,
square-shaped head, a black neck, and a whitish
underwing. It is about 22 inches long.

Pink-Tusked Elephant
Unknown ELEPHANT of China, said to have
lived during the T’ang Dynasty (a.D. 618-907).
Scientific name: Elephas maximus rubridens,
given by P. E. P. Deraniyagala in 1950.
Physical description: Black skin. Small, pink
tusks.
Behavior: Its ivory was as prized as that of
Asian elephants elsewhere.
Distribution: Leizhou Peninsula, Guangdong
Province; southeastern Guangxi Province,
China.
Significant sighting: An ivory carving of this
elephant is housed in Chicago’s Field Museum.

Pinky
Freshwater Monster of Florida.
Etymology: From its skin color.
Physical description: Pink color. Bones show
through skin. Head the size of a human head.
Snail-like horns with a knobbed tip. Flabby skin
on the side of the head. Downturned mouth.
Neck, at least 3 feet long. Dark, slanted eyes.
Behavior: Inquisitive.
Habitat: Possibly amphibious.
Distribution: St. Johns River, Florida.
Significant sighting: On May 10, 1975,
Charles and Dorothy Abram were fishing with
some friends when they saw the head and neck
of a large, pink animal about 20 feet away. It
turned its head to look at them and then sub-
merged after about eight seconds.
Possible explanations:
(1) A floating tree trunk.
(2) The white scutes of the Atlantic
sturgeon ( Acipenser oxyrhynchus) , which
grows to 14 feet, might be mistaken for
bony skin. These fishes spawn in the rivers
of Florida.
(3) The Florida manatee ( Trichechus
manatus latirostris) is light gray in color.
From March through October, the St.
Johns River is a center of abundance for
these sirenians.
(4) A surviving Thescelosaurus neglectus , a
436 PINK-TUSKED ELEPHANT
12-foot-long ornithopod dinosaur that lived
in the Late Cretaceous, 70 million years
ago, in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and
Wyoming, suggested by Mark A. Hall.
(5) An unknown species of giant
salamander, suggested by Karl Shuker.

Physical description: Horselike head. Large
eyes.
Distribution: Rivers in the pampas of central
Argentina.

Pitt Lake Giant
True Giant of western North America.
Etymology: After the lake where one of the
sightings took place.
Physical description: Height, 10-15 feet. Cov-
ered in hair that is longer on the head, thinner
on the arms. Square-set shoulders. Arms hang
below the knees. Hands are the size and shape of
canoe paddles.
Tracks: Flat impression. Four-toed. Size, 24
inches long by 12 inches wide. Leaves a pink
tint in the snow.
Distribution: Pitt Lake in southwestern
British Columbia; Big Horn Dam area and
Cold Lake, Alberta; Snoqualmie, Washington;
Astoria, Oregon; Great Falls, Montana.
Significant sightings: In late June 1965, Ron
and Loren Welch found a set of tracks of gigan-
tic proportions in the snow northwest of Pitt
Lake. They followed them to a small, ice-bound
lake, where they saw a large creature watching
them. One of the men drew a sketch of the an-
imal and the tracks. The creature remained im-
mobile, so they moved on. Later in the day, they
returned, but it was gone.

Pitt Lake Lizard
Large LIZARD of western Canada.
Variant name: Canadian Alligator.
Physical description: Length, 5-10 feet.
Smooth skin. Horns behind the head. Two rows
of sharp teeth.
Distribution: Pitt Lake, British Columbia.
Significant sighting: On June 3, 1973, Warren
and Sharon Scott observed a number of huge
reptiles in the lake. Warren captured three
smaller specimens and sent one to the biology
department of Simon Fraser University, but
there is no record of its receipt.
Possible explanations:
(1) The largest lizardlike animal in British
Columbia is the Pacific giant salamander
( Dicamptodon tenebrosus ), but this
amphibian has a marbled appearance with
dark spots and only grows to about 1 1
inches.
(2) An unknown species of Monitor lizard
(Family Varanidae).

PITT LAKE LIZARD 437
Ponik
Freshwater Monster of Quebec, Canada.
Etymology: A shortened form of Poheneg-
amook. This name was given to the monster in
1974, the centenary of the town of St.-
Eleuthere.
Variant names: Che\AL Marin (French, “sea
horse”), Mantouche (Cree/Algonquian), Vache
marine (French, “sea cow”).
Physical description: Dark color. Length, up to
40 feet. Horse-, cow-, or dolphinlike head.
Horn sometimes reported. Long neck. Several
humps. Sawtooth back sometimes reported.
Two pairs of pectoral and ventral fins.
Tracks: Circular prints, like a horse’s.
Distribution: Lake Pohenegamook, Quebec.
Significant sightings: An unnamed lumberjack
saw a strange black creature in the lake in 1874.
In May 1957, Philippe Gagne and his wife
were fishing in the adjacent St. Francois River
when they saw a creature 1 5 feet long with the
head of a fish. It submerged with a splash and
resurfaced 25 feet away.
The cure J. -Leopold Plante, pastor of the
parish of St.-Eleuthere, saw “a long overturned
canoe crossing the lake, leaving a wake behind”
in 1957.
Vadim D. Vladykov of the Quebec Depart-
ment of Game and Fisheries visited the lake in
1958 to investigate monster sightings. The re-
ports he collected describe a brown or black an-
imal 12-35 feet long with a sawtooth fin down
its back. However, after several months’ investi-
gation, he was unable to report anything con-
clusive. The report that he submitted to the
ministry disappeared in 1960 after he left to go
to the University of Ottawa.
Farmer Louis Fournier saw a large, black
thing with three humps in the lake on July 8,
1976.
In the summer of 1977, Vital Nadou was
walking along the beach near the Hotel Po-
henegamook with his wife and children. They
saw three humps of an animal 20 feet long in
the water some 300 feet offshore.
A sonar trace of a large animal was obtained
in the summer of 1977 by Robert Murray,
Donald McPhee, and Josef Vykydal. They were
drifting down the lake in about 135 feet of
water when the sonar showed an object 25 feet
long at a depth of 25 feet under the boat. As
soon as they started the motor to follow it, it
disappeared.
In May 1978, Louise Briand watched a large,
black object twice rise up out of the water in the
lake in front of her house, then sink down again.
Gilles Lavoie and Regis Bouchard saw a long,
black object “like an overturned canoe” in the
lake on November 7, 1979.
Early on the morning of August 3, 1998,
Louis Therrien-St-Pierre saw a 20- to 25-foot
animal with a long, high fin about 200-300 feet
in the water of the municipal beach at St.-
Eleuthere.
Possible explanations:
(1) A deer or moose swimming across the
lake.
(2) A seal that made its way into the lake.
(3) The Atlantic sturgeon ( Acipenser
oxyrhynchus) swims up coastal rivers to
spawn in freshwater lakes. According to
several residents of St.-Eleuthere, Vladykov
learned that a former pastor of the local
church had brought a number of live
sturgeon from a nearby St. Lawrence River
port town and put them in the lake,
planning to raise them domestically for their
caviar, but the sturgeon escaped. Other
people had done the same, purchasing live
fish at St. Alexandre or Riviere-du-Loup
and bringing them back to the lake, only to
lose them. Sturgeon are not now considered
native to the lake, however.

Pooka
Black Dog or Water Horse of Ireland.
Etymology: From the Irish puca, “ghost” or
a r • >5
rairy.
Variant names: Bauchan, Bocan (Gaelic),
Bogan, Bucca (Cornish), Bucca-boo, Buggane
(Manx), Bwbach (Welsh), Bwca (Welsh),
Bwgan (Welsh), Phooca, Phouka, Puca, Puck
(English), Pwca (Welsh).
Physical description: Like a black dog, horse,
or calf. Can also appear in human form. Eyes
like blazing coals.
Behavior: Usually malevolent and demonic
but sometimes benevolent. Active at dusk.
Spoils blackberries. Has supernatural powers.
Habitat: Swamps, bogs, lakes.
Distribution: Ireland; also Scotland, Wales,
Cornwall, and the Isle of Man.
Significant sightings: A Pooka was said to in-
habit a lagoon called the Poulapuca (Pooka’s
Pool) in County Wicklow, Ireland, before the
valley was flooded to create a reservoir for
Dublin.
A black dog trotted alongside a young man as
he was cycling home near Ballygar, County Gal-
way, Ireland, one night in 1913. The animal
kept looking at him in a way that made him un-
easy. He later found that other people avoided
that stretch of road because of the dog, which
had a disconcerting way of vanishing into thin
air.
Possible explanation: A folk memory of the
mythical Celtic spirit horse that carried dead he-
roes to paradise.

Popobawa
Flying Humanoid of East Africa.
Etymology: From the Swahili (Bantu) popo
(“bat”) + bawa (“wing”).
Physical description: Hairy dwarf. Single Cy-
clops eye. Small, pointed ears. Bat wings.
Talons.
Behavior: Swoops into houses and rapes men.
Has an acrid smell.
Distribution: Pemba and Zanzibar Islands,
Tanzania.
Significant sightings: After the Popobawa first
appeared on Pemba for a few weeks in 1972,
men shamefully announced they had been
sodomized. The creature returned once in the
1980s, in April 1995, in 2000, and in July 2001
on Zanzibar, where it attacked males sleeping
alone. Hospitals treated men for broken ribs,
bruises, and other injuries inflicted by the crea-
ture. After a month, the attacks stopped.
Possible explanations:
(1) Hysteria caused by recurring political
tensions on the islands.
(2) A hypnopompic or hypnogogic
hallucination — phenomena that occur while
going to sleep or waking up and involve a
choking or pressing sensation on the chest.

Poskok
Mystery SNAKE of Eastern Europe.
Etymology: Serbo-Croatian, “jumper.”
Physical description: Length, 2-3 feet. Thick-
ness, 1.5 inches. Gray to dark reddish-brown
color.
Behavior: Venomous. Aggressive when dis-
turbed. Can jump a distance of 5 feet, moving 3
feet into the air.
Distribution: Dalmatian Coast, Croatia; Sara-
jevo area, Bosnia; Montenegro.
Present status: No snake known to science has
the ability to jump into the air from the ground.
At best, snakes can lunge while striking. Golden
tree snakes ( Chrysopelea spp.) of Southeast Asia
manage to jump from tree to tree.
Possible explanations:
(1) One of Yugoslavia’s whip snakes: the
Balkan whip snake (Coluber gemonensis), the
Large whip snake ( C. jugular is) , Dahl’s whip
snake (C. najadum ), or the Western whip
snake (C. viridiflavus) . These nonvenomous
snakes are similar in size and color to the
Poskok.
(2) One of the area’s vipers: Orsini’s viper
(Vipera ursinii ), the Common viper (V.
berus ), or the Nose-horned viper (V
ammodytes). The latter is especially
venomous but has distinctive zigzag
markings and a nose horn.
(3) Snakes seen on bushes or low trees are
sometimes presumed to have jumped there.

Poua
Legendary giant Bird of New Zealand.
Etymology: Waitaha Maori (Austronesian)
name.
440 POPOBAWA
Variant names: Breaksea devil, Hakawai,
Hakuai, Hakuwai, Harkowhy, Hokioi, Poua-
kai, Poukai, Pouwa, Puoa.
Physical description: Resembles a giant eagle.
Behavior: Nocturnal. Call is a screaming
“hakuai, hakuai, ooh,” followed by the sound of
a clanking chain. Darts down from the sky and
seizes men, women, and children, carrying them
off as food.
Distribution: South Island, Stewart Island,
Breaksea Island, and the Chatham Islands, New
Zealand.
Present status: The bird is said to have been
killed off a long time ago by a group of warriors
with red hair.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Great frigatebird ( Fregata minor),
which may have visited New Zealand in the
past.
(2) The Auckland Island snipe
( Coenocorypha aucklandica) , in display flight.
(3) The extinct New Zealand black swan
( Cygnus sumnerensis) , which had disappeared
before colonization.
(4) A surviving Haast’s eagle ( Harpagornis
moorei ), the largest known eagle, that fed
on giant moas. It had an estimated
wingspan of 9 feet 1 0 inches and talons the
size of tiger claws. It was apparently a
powerful flier but may have been too heavy
to soar.

PRIMATES (Unknown)
Primates are an order of mammals (Order Pri-
mates) to which human beings and about 200
other living species belong. In general, they have
round skulls containing brains that are large rel-
ative to body weight, high foreheads, eyes with
stereoscopic vision, hands that can grasp and
manipulate, fingers and toes with sensitive pads
and nails instead of claws, mobile arms and an-
kles, and two mammary glands.
Rocks in North America, Europe, and Asia
from the Paleocene, 65-54 million years ago,
are the earliest to contain fossil primates. The
fossils are diverse enough to suggest that pri-
mates may have been distinct from other mam-
mals as early as the Late Cretaceous, 70 million
years ago. Modern-looking primates appear in
the fossil record by the Eocene, 55-34 million
years ago. Until recently, a group of animals
called Plesiadapiformes that lived in North
America, Europe, and Asia in the Paleocene and
Early Eocene, 65-49 million years ago, were
considered “archaic primates.” However, recent
evidence suggests that they were more closely re-
lated to Flying lemurs (Order Dermoptera) than
to primates.
Living primates can be grouped into three
suborders: Prosimians, consisting of lemurs,
lorises, and bushbabies; Tarsiiformes, contain-
ing the tarsiers (which sometimes are grouped
with either of the two other suborders); and An-
thropoidea, covering monkeys, gibbons, orang-
utans, African apes, and humans. In recent
years, molecular biology has shown that Chim-
panzees ( Pan troglodyte s) are the closest relatives
to modern humans, so much so that human and
chimp hemoglobin is virtually identical. Taxon-
omists now tend to put chimps, bonobos, and
gorillas in the same subfamily (Homininae) as
humans, with orangutans as a sister group
(Ponginae) within the Family Hominidae.
For the purposes of this volume, which deals
with observations of allegedly undescribed
species, bipedal hominids are placed in separate
sections based on their size (GlANT HOMINIDS,
Wildmen, and Small Hominids), while any-
thing that prefers to walk on all fours or swing
in the trees remains here in the Primate section.
This categorization may not be fair to some
PRIMATES 441
cryptids, which ultimately could be cataloged
somewhere else if a specimen is obtained, but it
will have to do for now. Sometimes, the only
characteristic that untrained observers comment
upon is gait (and hairiness — but this is a given
since sightings of nonhairy primates undoubt-
edly involve humans of some kind).
The three families of more than fifty species
of prosimian Lemurs (Lemuridae, Cheirogalei-
dae, and Indriidae) are confined to Madagascar,
an island with the third-highest rate of primate
diversity in the world (after Brazil and Indone-
sia). It has its fair share of lemur cryptids as
well. Eight genera of the related Lorises
(Lorisidae) reside in India, Southeast Asia, and
Africa. These creatures are little studied in the
wild, so there may well be new species awaiting
discovery.
What we traditionally call monkeys have
moderately sized brains and bodies, sport long
tails (usually), eat fruits and foliage, and move in
trees rather than along the ground. New World
monkeys (the Cebidae and Atelidae families)
have external noses with nostrils that face to the
side, three premolar teeth in both jaws, curved
nails, and long tails. Old World monkeys (Fam-
ily Cercopithecide) have narrower noses with
nostrils facing down, two premolar teeth, flat-
tened nails, and tails that vary in length from
long to stubby. Monkeylike primates probably
first arose in the Eocene, but the earliest known
anthropoid fossils are 32 million years old, from
Early Oligocene deposits at Fayum, Egypt.
Apes evolved from Old World monkeys in the
Oligocene, 33-26 million years ago. In that pe-
riod, the fossil monkey Aegyptopithecus already
had some apelike characteristics. The fossil
African ape Proconsul was long thought to have
been the oldest, but in the early 1990s, a redat-
ing of the Lothidok, Kenya, site to about 26 mil-
lion years ago transferred the honor to Kamoya-
pithecus hamiltoni, a Late Oligocene ape similar
to Proconsul except for some dental details. Pro-
consulid species ranged in size from a small gib-
bon to a female gorilla; they survived in Africa
until the Late Miocene, 15-14 million years ago.
The Hominidae sprang up in Africa in the
Miocene, about 17 million years ago. This fam-
ily includes the largest of all living primates, the
Mountain gorilla ( Gorilla gorilla beringei) of
Central Africa. The average adult male stands 5
feet 6 inches tall and weighs about 460 pounds.
The Lowland gorilla subspecies is only slightly
smaller. (The Pleistocene Chinese ape Giganto-
pithecus undoubtedly exceeded that size; how-
ever, since no postcranial bones have been dis-
covered, its true size remains in question.) One
group of apes left Africa and migrated to Asia,
resulting ultimately in the Orangutan ( Pongo
pygmaeus) of Indonesia. The other stayed in
Africa and differentiated into gorilla, chim-
panzee, and human lineages.
Homo sapiens is the result of two major shifts
in habitat: Around 8-5 million years ago, a
chimpanzee-like ape abandoned the rain forest
for the outlying belt of tree savanna and evolved
into the slightly more bipedal but still arboreal
australopiths. Then, around 2.5 million years
ago, the increasingly arid African climate
changed much of the tree savanna environment
into less-protective bush savanna, forcing aus-
tralopiths to use their wits and bigger brains to
develop defensive and hunting weapons, fire,
and a more exclusively terrestrial form of loco-
motion. These developments resulted in Homo
erectus and Homo rudolfensis.
Of the 65 primates in this section, 10 involve
prosimians, 1 is apparently a tarsier, at least 10
are monkeylike, and the other 44 share some
apelike characteristics. Of the 13 apelike cryp-
tids in Africa, 7 are chimpanzee-like, 4 are go-
rilla-like, and 2 (the KOOLOO-KAMBA and
PYGMY Gorilla) are said to be apes that are
smaller than gorillas but larger than chimps. Of
the 1 1 apelike cryptids in Asia, 7 seem related to
the orangutan. Apes in the Americas are much
more ambiguously described.
Primate taxonomy is still in a state of flux and
controversy, with new discoveries and molecular
studies changing our understanding of known
species almost on a yearly basis. With unknown
species, an extra dose of caution seems war-
ranted before offering anything more than ten-
tative guesses concerning their identity.

Primor’ye Giant Snake
Unknown SNAKE of far eastern Siberia.
Physical description: Length, 15-30 feet. Dark
color. Some reports mention short legs.
Distribution: Vicinity of Samarga and Angu
Rivers, northern Primor’ye Territory, Siberia,
Russia.
Significant sighting: On their way to work at
the Nikolayevskiy mines in 1984, workers saw a
30-foot serpent crossing a road.

Proto-Pigmy
Term coined by Ivan T. Sanderson to designate
Small Hominids, including the Orang Pen-
dek, Sehite, Agogwe, and Teh-Lma. He con-
sidered them humans, possibly the ancestors of
the Pygmies (Mbuti, Twa, and Mbenga peo-
ples), who are short-statured, forest-dwelling
groups of Central Africa. See PYGMY (CLASSI-
CAL).
Variant spelling: Proto-Pygmy.

Schuster, 1999), p. 203.
Pskov Crocodile
Mystery CROCODILIAN of European Russia.
Physical description: Like a Nile crocodile.
Behavior: Aggressive.
Distribution: Velikaya River, Pskov Region,
Russia.
Significant sighting: In 1582, crocodiles
emerged from the Velikaya River and bit many
people. Some were killed, and others escaped
into the countryside.
Present status: Under ordinary circumstances,
the farthest north any crocodilians live in the
Old World is the mouth of the Nile River in
Egypt, roughly 31° north latitude. Pskov is
much farther north, at 58°.
Possible explanation: Boris V. and Valentin B.
Sapunov concluded that some Nile crocodiles
0 Crocodylus niloticus ) were being transported
through Russia to Lithuania, where a reptile
farm of some kind apparently existed in the late
sixteenth century. Some accident or event
caused their release, and they subsisted on fishes
for a while, scaring many people in the area.

Puff
Freshwater Monster of Saskatchewan,
Canada.
Etymology: Presumably named after “Puff the
Magic Dragon,” a 1963 song by the musical trio
Peter, Paul, and Mary.
Physical description: Like a big log. Scaly.
Behavior: Amphibious.
Distribution: Peter Pond Lake, Saskatchewan.
PUFF 443
Significant sightings : Two ambiguous sight-
ings in 1977 and 1979.

Pukau
Unknown piglike HOOFED Mammal of South-
east Asia.
Etymology: Dusun (Austronesian) word.
Physical description: Resembles a cross be-
tween a deer and a pig. Sharp tongue.
Behavior: Runs swiftly if disturbed.
Distribution: Mount Madalong, in Sabah
State, Borneo, Malaysia.
Possible explanation: The Babirusa ( Babyrousa
babyrussa ), whose upturned tusks might be de-
scribed as a sharp tongue. Though it is found
only on Sulawesi, Burn, and neighboring is-
lands, this wild pig’s presence in Borneo could
account for the Pukau.

Pukwudgee
LITTLE People of eastern North America.
Etymology: Delaware and Wampanoag (Al-
gonquian), “little wild man of the forest.”
Variant names: Bagwajininiwag (Ojibwa/
Algonquian), Bgoji-nin-wag (Ojibwa/ Algon-
quian), Pa-i-sa-ke (Miami/Algonquian), Pawee-
suk, Pia-sa-ki, Pikwatci’ni (“wild Indian”), Puk-
wadjiineesuk (“little Indians”), Pukwatcininins
(“little man of the woods”), Puk-wud-jie.
Physical description: Height, 2 feet. White
skin. Light brown hair.
Behavior: Builds huts of grass and sticks.
Wears shirts made of grass or bark.
Habitat: Caves along rivers.
Distribution: Cape Cod, Massachusetts; Indi-
ana; the Lake Superior area of central Ontario,
Canada; northern Minnesota; northern Wis-
consin; northern Michigan.
Significant sighting: Paul Startzman saw a lit-
tle man wearing a blue gown along the White
River in Indiana in June 1927. He encountered
Pukwudgees several more times in the 1930s
and claims that the small, wooden hut- or te-
peelike structures he has found in the woods
were made by them for shelter.

Pumina
Giant SNAKE of Central Africa.
Variant names: Moma (“python”), Mpumina.
Physical description: Length, 38-46 feet. Dark
above, white below. Large, triangular head, 30
inches wide.
Distribution: Kasai and western Katanga Re-
gions, Democratic Republic of the Congo, espe-
cially Lake Upemba.
Significant sighting: In August 1959, a me-
chanic named Kindt took a photo of a giant
python from a military helicopter in the
Katanga Region some 60 miles northwest of
Kamina, Democratic Republic of the Congo. It
appeared to be 38-46 feet long.
Possible explanation: The African rock python
(. Python sebae) reaches 30-33 feet. Reports of
larger specimens are rare and often based only
on hearsay.

444 PUKAU
Pygmy (Classical)
Small Hominid of East Africa.
Etymology: From the Greek pygmaios
(“cubit”), the distance from the elbow to the tip
of the middle finger.
Physical description: Height, 3 feet— 4 feet 6
inches.
Behavior: Dances well. Builds houses of mud,
feathers, and eggshells. Eats the eggs of cranes
and battles the migratory adult birds when they
attack. Rides small horses, rams, and she-goats.
Uses bow- and- arrow weapons.
Habitat: Lives in caves (or in a rain forest
with a cavelike canopy).
Distribution: North or East Africa, though
transplanted frequently to Arabia, Turkey,
India, or southeastern Europe by confused writ-
ers.
Significant sightings: An inscription at Aswan,
Egypt, on the rock tomb of a man named
Harukef reproduces a letter sent from Pharaoh
Pepi II (ca. 2270 B.C.) thanking him for bring-
ing a dancing dwarf (Dongo) back from an ex-
pedition to the south.
Three short men holding walking sticks are
depicted on a frieze in the palace of Osorkon II
(ca. 860 B.C.) at Bubastis, Egypt.
The Greek epic poem The Iliad refers to Pyg-
mies that battle with cranes. Pomponius Mela
in the first century A.D. placed the crane-
battling Pygmies in East Africa inland from the
Golfe de Tadjoura, Djibouti.
Herodotus told a story at fourth hand about
a group of young Libyan adventurers who made
an attempt to cross the Sahara but were attacked
and captured by a group of dwarfs who lived by
a great crocodile-infested river that flowed from
west to east. Some scholars identify this as the
Niger River in Mali; others have suggested the
Bodele Depression, now dry, in Chad.
The only Egyptian depiction of anything re-
sembling a modern rain forest Pygmy is an un-
dated statuette found in the Cairo Museum.
One Egyptian deity that rose to prominence
in the Ptolemaic era was Bes, portrayed as a
grotesque dwarf with distinctly African features.
Bes had thick ears, long arms, and bowed legs
and was associated with childbirth.
In the sixth century, Nonnosos, a Byzantine
ambassador to the king of Ethiopia, made a stop
at the Farasan Islands in the Red Sea off Arabia,
where he observed small, black men with hairy
bodies. They spoke an incomprehensible lan-
guage and only wore loincloths.
Some West African legends of the semimyth-
ical GNENA may be based on memories of the
Pygmies of the classical world.
Present status: The Pygmies known to the an-
cient Greeks and Egyptians seem to have been a
group of short-statured people other than the
forest-dwelling Pygmies of Central Africa.
However, by the late eighteenth century, they
were considered little more than imaginary crea-
tures, despite the realistic descriptions given in
ancient accounts. In the nineteenth and twenti-
eth centuries, opinion shifted to explaining the
classical Pygmies as products of ancient travel-
ers’ tales and rumors concerning the newly dis-
covered Central African forest Pygmies.
Possible explanation: Ancestors of the Mbenga
or other Pygmies of the equatorial forest, who
may have had a greater range in ancient times.

Pygmy Brown Bear
Small Bear of South America.
Distribution: Yanachaga-Chemillen National
Park, Pasco Department, Peru.
Significant sightings: Park rangers claim to have
had several encounters with these bears, includ-
ing a young one being raised by a local person.
Possible explanation: Undersized specimens of
the Spectacled bear ( Tremarctus ornatus).

Pygmy Elephant
Small ELEPHANT of Central Africa.
Scientific names: Elephas africana pumilio ,
given by Theodore Noack in 1906; Elephas
fransseni , given by Henri Schouteden in 1914.
These designations have changed to Loxodonta
a. pumilio and E fransseni with the taxonomic
switch of African elephants from Elephas to Lox-
odonta a few years later.
Variant names: Abele (Kari/Bantu), Esemasa,
Essala (in Central African Republic), Kowuru,
Lokpaka (in southern Cameroon), M’bakiri
(Banda/Ubangi), Messala (in Cameroon and
the Republic of the Congo), Mussaga (in
Gabon), Ndgoko na maiji (Teke/Bantu),
Ndimbila, NZEFU Loi', Sumbi (in Sierra Leone),
Wakawaka (in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo), Water elephant.
Physical description: Shoulder height, 3 feet 8
inches-6 feet 8 inches. Weight, up to 3,100
pounds. Reddish-brown to brownish-gray or
black skin. Flat face. Large, roundish ears.
Trunk with two fingerlike appendages on the
tip. Relatively long tusks (2 feet 2 inches long
on a specimen 5 feet 5 inches tall at the shoul-
der). Highest point of back is immediately be-
hind the head. Round, thin tail with a tuft of
hairs at the end.
A more exclusively aquatic variety in the
Congo could be a completely different animal,
possibly related to the WATER LlON. Aquatic va-
riety: Ears are relatively smaller than the African
elephant’s. Head is long and ovoid. Short, 2-
foot trunk. No tusks. Longish neck. Curved
back. Shiny skin. Short legs.
Behavior: Truculent, aggressive temperament.
Raises its trunk frequently to catch scents. Trav-
els in troops (ten to twenty) or herds (fifty to
seventy) of adults and young. Aquatic variety:
Nocturnal. Swims with trunk and top of the
head out of the water. Grazes on rank grass at
night. Said to capsize boats by rising up unex-
pectedly out of the water. Destroys fishnets and
traps.
Tracks: The aquatic variety shows four dis-
tinctly separated toes, with the sole impression
less pronounced than that of other elephants.
Length, 10-11 inches.
Habitat: Dense, swampy rain forest.
Distribution: From Sierra Leone to the De-
mocratic Republic of the Congo, especially Nd-
jole and Fernan Vaz in Gabon; the Yobe River
in the Central African Republic; southern
Cameroon; Equatorial Guinea; Lake Mai-
Ndombe, Democratic Republic of the Congo;
the Uele River near Gangala-na-Bodio, Demo-
cratic Republic of the Congo.
Significant sightings: In 1904, an enigmatic,
unfossilized ivory tusk that matches no known
species of elephant was acquired in the market-
place at Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, by Baron Mau-
rice de Rothschild. It is about 2 feet long along
the curve, flat along most of its length, and
rounded at the tip, and it has five natural
grooves on the bottom.
A young Pygmy elephant, captured in the Re-
public of the Congo by Carl Hagenback in
1905, was examined in Hannover, Germany, by
Theodore Noack, who designated it a sub-
species of the African elephant. The animal,
nicknamed “Congo,” grew to a shoulder height
of 6 feet at the Bronx Zoo before it died of a leg
disease in 1915.
In June 1907, a traveler named Le Petit ob-
served the aquatic variety, called locally Ndgoko
na maiji, in the Congo River near its junction
with the Kwa. At a later date, he observed five
specimens on land near Lake Mai-Ndombe,
Democratic Republic of the Congo.
In 1911, a Belgian officer, Lieutenant
Franssen, killed a specimen that was 5 feet 5
inches tall, with tusks more than 2 feet long, in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
In 1913, a settler living near Lefini, Republic
of the Congo, showed Hans Schomburgk a thick
piece of skin, densely covered with red hair, that
was said to come from a “river elephant.”
In January 1955, Francois Edmond-Blanc
went on an expedition to southern Cameroon
to collect a Pygmy elephant for the University of
Copenhagen. After three hours of tracking on
marshy ground, he came across a group of
twelve elephants that did not exceed a shoulder

Zoo before being transferred to the Bronx Zoo. (Fortean Picture Library)
height of 6 feet.
A Captain Chicharro killed an adult elephant
6 feet 6 inches tall near the Rio Benito, Equato-
rial Guinea, in September 1957. It was one of a
herd of twenty-one individuals.
German animal collector Ulrich Roeder ex-
amined a dead male specimen in southern
Cameroon in the 1970s. Its age was approxi-
mately sixteen to eighteen years, and its tusks
measured 2 feet 5 inches.
H. J. Steinfurth filmed three Pygmy ele-
phants in a clearing near the Yobe River, Cen-
tral African Republic. Each one had the long
tusks of an adult and stood between 5 feet 3
inches and 5 feet 6 inches at the shoulder.
Photographs showing a band of Pygmy ele-
phants were taken in May 1982 in the Lik-
ouala drainage area of the Republic of the
Congo by former West German ambassador
Harald N. Nestroy. The group included four
adults and two juveniles. The shoulder height
of the fully tusked adults was estimated at 5
feet, based on the presence of a Great egret
(. Egretta alba :) in the photo. Shortly afterward,
Nestroy saw forest elephants and forest buffalo
in the same clearing, all much larger than the
pygmies.
A dead female Pygmy elephant, 5 feet 3
inches at the shoulder, was found at the Pygmy
village of Makokou, Gabon, by L. P. Knoepfler
in the 1980s. It contained a full-term fetus,
demonstrating that the animal was an adult.
Present status: Accepted by some, but not all,
taxonomists.
Possible explanations:
(1) The African forest elephant ( Loxodonta
PYGMY ELEPHANT 447
cyclotis). Much confusion exists in the
mainstream literature between the forest
elephant and the Pygmy elephant. If
mentioned at all, the latter is dismissed as
a misidentified cyclotis , with the caveat that
it is smaller than the African bush elephant
(. L . africana). However, the shoulder height
for forest males is given as 7 feet 9 inches-
9 feet 9 inches, compared with the bush
male’s 9 feet 9 inches-13 feet; female
heights are cited as 6 feet 9 inches-8 feet
6 inches (for forest elephants), compared
with 7 feet 9 inches-9 feet 9 inches (for
bush elephants). Pygmies are distinctly
smaller. Forest elephants do have more
rounded ears than africana and straighter,
thinner tusks.
(2) Juvenile African forest elephants,
suggested by Glover Allen, although
these animals remain integrated with
adult herds and do not form troops of
their own.
(3) A distinct species of small African
elephant that prefers a moist, swampy
habitat; perhaps it evolved, like other
African elephants, from the ancestral
L. adaurora some 3 million years ago.
(4) A surviving deinothere, a family
of proboscideans that lived in Europe,
Africa, and India during the Pliocene,
3-2 million years ago, suggested by
Bernard Heuvelmans. Deinotherium
giganteum stood up to 13 feet tall at
the shoulder and had a short trunk
and two small, backward-curving tusks
in the lower jaw. Smaller species such
as D. bavaricum , the size of a small
Asian elephant, persisted into the
Pleistocene.
(5) An evolved, pig-sized mastodont such as
Phiomia , with short upper and lower shovel-
shaped tusks and a long neck. Known from
Egypt and India in the Oligocene, 26
million years ago.
(6) An evolved version of the tapirlike,
semiaquatic Moeritherium (a proboscidean
known from the Late Eocene of North
Africa, 36-34 million years ago), an
alternate suggestion by Karl Shuker that
presupposes the development of a trunk and
long tusks.
(7) Some reports of the aquatic, sabre-
toothed WATER Lion may be mixed up
with those of an aquatic, tusked elephant.

448 PYGMY ELEPHANT
Pygmy Gorilla
Unknown PRIMATE of Central Africa.
Scientific names: Gorilla mayema , given by
Edmond Alix and Aime Bouvier in 1877; re-
described as Pseudogorilla mayema in 1913 by
Daniel G. Elliot; renamed Gorilla (Pseudogo-
rilla) ellioti by Serge Frechkop in 1943.
Physical description: Smaller than a gorilla but
larger than a chimpanzee. Small head. No sagit-
tal crest. Prominent forehead. Long hair on the
back. Shorter shoulder bone. Slender and less
muscular forearm, hand, lower leg, and foot.
Distribution: Cabinda and Gabon; specimens
were not found in Maniema National Park of
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as once
thought.
Present status: Not currently recognized as a
distinct species. Alix and Bouvier’s specimen
was merely a small, female Lowland gorilla ( Go-
rilla gorilla) , and Elliot based his description on
an immature male and a mature female without
a sagittal crest.

Qattara Cheetah
Mystery big Cat of North Africa.
Physical description: Pale cheetah with a thick
coat.
Distribution: The Qattara Depression, Egypt.
Significant sightings: Reports date back to the
1960s. A specimen was captured by a Bedouin
shepherd in 1967.
Cheetahlike tracks were photographed on
two occasions in the 1990s.
Possible explanation: An isolated morph pop-

Qoqogaq
Unknown Bear of Alaska.
Etymology: Eskimo-Aleut word.
Variant name: Qoqogiaq.
Physical description: White bear. Head, 5 feet
wide. Ten legs.
Behavior: Drags kayaks under water. Lies on
its back and waves its legs in the air.
Distribution: Cape Prince of Wales to Point
Barrow, Alaska.
Significant sighting: A party of Inuit hunters
traveling eastward from Point Barrow, Alaska,
in the fall of 1913 heard a Qoqogaq swimming
under the ice beneath their sleds. It poked its
head through the ice when one of them
coughed.

Quagga
A type of zebra (HOOFED Mammal) in South
Africa, presumed extinct in the wild since the
mid-nineteenth century.
Etymology: Nama (Khoisan) word.
Scientific name: Equus quagga, given by Jo-
hann Friedrich Gmelin in 1788.
Physical description: Brownish or yellowish
ground color. Zebralike brown stripes only on
the head, neck, and shoulders. Striping varies
from full length to half length.
Behavior: Grazes in large herds.
Distribution: Formerly ranged from the Great
Karoo in Western Cape Province, north to the
Vaal River in Free State Province, South Africa.
Possibly extended into Great Namaqualand,
Namibia.
451
Significant sighting: Bernard Heuvelmans
mentions occasional Quagga sightings in the
Namibian Desert.
Present status: The last known Quagga died at
the Amsterdam Zoo on August 12, 1883. Re-
cent DNA analysis of a museum specimen indi-
cates that it was almost certainly a variant of the
Common or Burchelfs zebra ( Equus burchelli).
The South African Museum’s Quagga Project
has been attempting since 1986 to bring the an-
imal back through selective breeding.

spikes like those on a Viking helmet.
Distribution: Pu Mat Reserve, Vietnam.
Significant sighting: In 1994, biologist
Nguyen Ngoc Chinh was given a Quang khem
skull by hunters in the Pu Mat Reserve. DNA
from similar skulls could not be matched with
any known species by Peter Arctander at the
University of Copenhagen.

Queensland Tiger
Catlike MARSUPIAL of Australia.
Variant names: Native tiger, Queensland
tiger-cat, Yaddi, Yarri (Herbert River area),
Yedna tiger. In the Warlpiri (Australian) lan-
guage of the Northern Territory, yarri is a verb
meaning “to threaten” or “to attack.” In
Queensland, the term is also used for the Spot-
ted-tailed quo 11 or Tiger-cat ( Dasyurus macula -
tus). In the south part of Western Australia, it
refers to the Blackbutt eucalyptus tree ( Eucalyp-
tus patens ) .
Physical description: Heavier build than a do-
mestic cat. Length, 4-5 feet, including the tail.
Shoulder height, 1 foot 6 inches. Short, coarse
hair. Lawn or gray coat, with 2. 5 -inch black
stripes encircling the body and tail. Round, cat-
like head, large in proportion to its body. Green
eyes. Pointed ears. Prominent incisors. Short
legs. Large paws with long front claws. Long tail.
Behavior: Arboreal. Has a savage disposition
when cornered. Makes growling whines, snarls,
and roars. Wallabies are its favorite food,
though it also attacks livestock.
Tracks: Elongated toe pads, set more or less in
a row. The same size as a large dog’s. Grooming
claws are evident.
Habitat: Rocky, forested areas.
Distribution: Queensland, especially in the
coastal ranges: in northern Queensland, from
Cairns to Cardwell; in southeastern Queens-
land, from Biggenden to Tamborine Mountain.
Significant sightings: The thirteen-year-old
son of a police magistrate, Brinsley G. Sheridan,
encountered and treed a striped cat near Card-
well, Queensland, on August 2, 1871. His dog
annoyed it, whereupon it became savage and
rushed down the tree at them. Sheridan became
frightened and went home.
Robert Arthur Johnstone and a group of na-
tive police came across a large animal in a tree
west of Cardwell in 1872. It jumped to another
tree and came down tail first. It was fawn-
colored with darker markings and had a long,
thick tail and a round head with no visible ears.
Johnstone found its lair, which was littered with
the crushed bones of rock wallabies.
Accounts of Queensland tigers being killed
were frequent in the early twentieth century,
though no pelts or skeletons were retained: J.
MacGeehan’s dogs killed one at Kairi in 1900;
J. R. Cunningham and his dog killed another at
Gootchie sometime before 1926; a cat the size
of a sheepdog was killed after it raided a hen-
house at the head of the Mulgrave River around
1929; and A. W. Blackman and others shot one
in the Cardwell Range in 1932.
In May or June 1940, Nigel and Charlie Tutt
452 QUANG KHEM
Skull of the Marsupial lion ( Thylacoleo carnifex), a
possible candidate for the identity of the QUEENSLAND
tiger. (© 1999 Jack Rabbit)
were hiking on Mount Stanley when they
rounded a bend and saw a large cat sunning it-
self on a pine stump. They stopped about 20
feet away from it and noted that it was reddish,
with dark-brown stripes all over its body and
legs. It looked at them coolly for about twenty
seconds and then bounded away.
A man named Gamer was riding through the
brush near Bidwell, Queensland, in 1954 when
he surprised a large, gray cat with dark-orange
stripes. He was struck by its savage nature and
large fangs.
From 1970 to 1973, naturalist Janeice Plun-
kett collected more than 100 reports of this
creature throughout Queensland.
Mike Jones ran across a black-striped, pan-
ther-sized animal feeding on a dead calf in the
mountains near Mareeba, Queensland, in 1983.
On May 30, 1987, Greg Calvert found tracks
larger than a dingo’s near Hughenden, Queens-
land, and followed them for several hundred
yards. They showed the grooming claws of a
marsupial.
Present status: Tony Healy and Paul Cropper
consider the animal extinct, the victim of
strychnine baits intended for dingos. Rex Gilroy
thinks it may persist, based on recent sightings.
Possible explanations:
(1) A surviving Marsupial lion ( Thylacoleo
carnifex ), a leopard-sized, arboreal marsupial
that lived as recently as 10,000 years ago, is
a good candidate. Its paws were fingerlike
(with pseudo-opposable thumbs each
bearing a huge claw) and designed for
climbing trees. It had two huge incisors and
two pairs of bladelike, carnassial teeth that
gave it a distinct (though not necessarily
catlike) look. Thylacoleo fossils have been
found in localities across Australia,
including at Darling Downs in Queensland.
(2) The Thylacine ( Thylacinus
cynocephalus i ), even if it were shown to
persist on the mainland, is too doglike, and
its stripes are only on its back. Moreover, it
does not climb trees. The tiger’s tusklike
teeth, curved claws, leopardlike growl, and
long tail are also unlike a Thylacine.
(3) The Spotted-tailed quoll ( Dasyurus
maculatus) is also called Tiger-cat and Yarri,
but it is spotted, looks more like a weasel,
and is not very fierce. Its body length is 2
feet, and its tail is 1 foot 6 inches long.

Quickfoot
WlLDMAN or Hairy Biped of Great Britain.
Variant names: Ghost Ape of Marwood, Mar-
tyn’s ape.
Physical description: Apelike or bearlike entity.
Covered with hair.
Behavior: Runs quickly.
Distribution: Devon and Dorset, England;
West Lothian, Scotland.
Significant sightings: In 1978, three boys ex-
ploring the woods near Kings Nympton,
Devon, saw an apelike or bearlike creature with
green eyes and a large muzzle.
David Colman was driving down a country
lane in the Bathgate Hills, West Lothian, Scot-
land, when he saw a humanoid running down a
path at great speed. It was 6 feet tall, with a hu-
manlike face. Dubbed “Quickfoot” by the press.
Possible explanations:
(1) Paranormal entity similar to the HAIRY
BIPEDS of North America.
(2) Exaggerated tales of feral people.
(3) Ghostly apparations, possibly of bears.

Quinkin
True Giant of Australia.
Etymology: From the Kuku-yalanji (Aus-
tralian) kuwinkan (“ghost”).
Physical description: Towers above the trees.
The giant Quinkin named Turramulli was said
to have only three clawed toes and three fingers.
Behavior: Nocturnal. Raids Aboriginal camps.
Habitat: Rock crevices; underground.
Distribution: Cape York, Queensland.
Significant sighting: Spirit people are depicted
in rock paintings in Queensland, especially
around Laura.

454 QUICKFOOT
R
RABBITS (Unknown)
Rabbits, hares, and pikas make up the Order
Lagomorpha, a group of small herbivores with
two pairs of upper incisors (compared to ro-
dents, which only have one pair). The earliest
fossil rabbits and hares (Family Leporidae) are
known from Asia in the Middle Eocene, 45 mil-
lion years ago. These long-eared hoppers rarely
turn up in cryptozoology; the only two instances
included here involve a misidentified Australian
marsupial and a diseased animal with a peculiar
condition.
Mystery Rabbits
Giant Rabbit; Horned Hare
Rainbow Serpent
Semimythical giant SNAKE of Australia.
Variant names: Almudj (Gunwinggu/Aus-
tralian), Dhakkan, Galeru, Julunggul, Kalseru,
Ngalyod (Gunwinggu/Australian), Takkan,
Wagyl, Wollunqua, Wonambi, Yingarna (for
the female), Yurlunggur (Bindubi/Australian).
Physical description: Horselike head. Horns or
ears. Skin glistens like a rainbow. Tail pointed
or spiked. Sometimes a composite creature, with
a kangaroo’s head and a crocodile’s tail joined
by a python’s body.
Behavior: Responsible for rain and floods.
Turns boats over but doesn’t attack people.
Oviparous.
Habitat: Rivers and estuaries.
Distribution: Arnhem Land, Northern Terri-
tory.
Significant sighting: Rock art depicting Rain-
bow serpents appeared in Arnhem Land as early
as 4000 B.c.
Possible explanations:
(1) A surviving Pleistocene madtsoiid snake,
the Giant Australian python ( Wonambi
naracoortensis) , known from fossil deposits
in South Australia. It ranged from 10 to 20
feet in length. It may have persisted until
40,000 or 30,000 years ago, or roughly the
age of rock- art depictions of the Rainbow
serpent by Aborigines.
(2) After a statistical analysis of 1 07 rock- art
images, Paul Tacon, Meredith Wilson, and
Christopher Chippindale determined that
the closest physical match is the foot-long
Ribboned pipefish ( Haliichthys taeniophora :),
found off Irian Jaya, Indonesia, and the
coast of northern Australia from Shark Bay
to the Torres Strait. Changes at the end of
the last Ice Age would have resulted in
incursions of the sea into traditional
hunting grounds. This bizarre-looking
marine fish, though small, could have
symbolized the new lifestyles generated by
earth changes and flooding.

Rakshi-Bompo
Alternate name for the Yeti of Central Asia.
Etymology: Tibetan/Indo-Aryan hybrid word
meaning “powerful demon,” according to Gor-
don Creighton. Rakshasa are Hindu demons
from the Ramayana; in some old epics, they
were the pre-Aryan inhabitants of India. Rakshi
is a Nepali alcoholic drink made from rice or
millet. Rag tse is Tibetan for “stone.” Bonpo was
a priest of the religion of Tibet prior to Bud-
dhism, often in charge of exorcisms.
Variant name: Ragshi.
Physical description: Height, 4-6 feet.
Behavior: Herbivorous. Fast runner.
Habitat: Dense forests.
Distribution: Nepal.
Significant sightings: In December 1957, a
group of Rakshi-bompo broke into the water mill
run by a Sherpa named Phurbu, near Malemchi-
gaon, Nepal. He found them inside, eating flour.
By the time villagers gathered to drive them
away, they had disappeared into the forest.

Rassic
Freshwater Monster of Sweden.
Etymology: After Lake Rasvalen.
Physical description: Length, 12-15 feet.
Looks like an overturned boat.
Distribution: Rasvalen, Orebro County, Swe-
den.
Significant sightings: In the summer of 1914,
Karl Gustavsson saw a large fish, 12 feet long, as
he was rowing across the lake.
Britta Olgemar watched a 15-foot animal
that looked like a log as it swam near the
Kalmarslund Recreation Center in the summer
of 1987.

Red Jamaican Parrot
Unknown Bird of the West Indies.
Physical description: Length, 9 inches. Primar-
ily red plumage. Yellow feathers streaked with
fine lines of red on the inside of wings and the
underside of tail.
Distribution: Jamaica.
Significant sighting: In July 1764, English
bird artist George Edwards painted a watercolor
of a red parrot owned by Alexander Russell. It
had been shot in Jamaica some time earlier and
preserved.
456 RAINBOWTIGER
Present status: Probably extinct. The bird was
said to have been unknown to Jamaicans even
when it was collected. It resembles no other liv-
ing parrot.
Possible explanation: An erythristic (red) vari-
ant of a West Indian amazon parrot ( Amazona
sp.).

Red Wolf
Mystery Dog of Western Europe.
Variant names: Chien rouge, Loup rouge,
Loup-brou.
Physical description: Like a wolf, except for its
red fur. Bright eyes.
Behavior: Attacks animals but avoids humans.
Distribution: Vienne Department, central
France.

Ren-Xiong
Mystery PRIMATE of East Asia.
Etymology: Mandarin Chinese (Sino-
Tibetan), “man-bear.”
Variant names: Gin-sung, Huan, Jen-hsiung.
Physical description: Height, more than 3 feet
when standing. Quadrupedal shoulder height,
16-20 inches. Covered with black, gray, or
brown hair. Round head, about 6-7 inches
long. Curly head-hair. Face looks human. Flat
mouth. Hands and feet have nails. Toenails are
flat. No hair on the buttocks. Short tail, if any.
Behavior: Walks on all fours with a rolling
gait. No language but can laugh. Eats raw meat,
corn, wild fruit, bark, bamboo shoots, grass, and
leaves. In former times, these creatures were
hunted in order to capture and domesticate
them for household and herding chores.
Distribution: Zhejiang Province, Shaanxi
Province, Shennongjia Forest in Hubei
Province, and western Yunnan Province, China.
Significant sightings : A Jen-hsiung was cap-
tured in 1954 when hunters aroused its curios-
ity with a piece of red cloth.
On May 23, 1957, a 5-foot-tall wild monkey
or WlLDMAN attacked Wang Congmei on her
way home from tending cattle in the Jiulong
Mountain area, near Zhuantang, Zhejiang
Province. Her screams brought help, and village
women struck the creature with a sticks and
forced it into the mud of a rice paddy, where it
got stuck. They beat the animal senseless, finally
chopping off its head. Its hands and feet were
taken to town for a reward and preserved by a
teacher, Zhou Shousong, who allowed them to
be examined by Zhou Guoxing in 1980. His
analysis showed that they belonged to an ex-
traordinarily large stump-tailed macaque.
Possible explanation: An outsize Stump-tailed
macaque ( Macaca arctoides) or the larger Pere
David’s macaque {M. thibetana). Macaques are
diurnal and both arboreal and terrestrial. They
have quite complex social and behavioral sys-
tems. Some use tools. Group size can vary from
10 to around 100 individuals. The animals can
be very aggressive, both to each other and to
other species. Stump-tailed macaques are feared
by locals. They tend to be the dominant species
whenever they are found in association with
other monkeys. They have a wide range of vo-
calizations and also communicate by gesture
and facial expressions. These calls and gestures
apparently have specific meanings.

REN-XIONG 457
Reunion Solitaire
Mystery flightless Bird of Reunion.
Scientific names: Raphus solitarius, given by
Edmond de Selys-Longchamps in 1848; Didus
borbonicus , given by Lionel Walter Rothschild
in 1907; Victoriornis imperially suggested by
Masauji Hachisuka in 1937.
Variant names: Dod-eersen, White dodo.
Physical description: White plumage. Smaller
bill. Long neck. Yellow wing feathers or black
wing tips. Slender feet. Tail is plumed.
Distribution: Reunion, in the Indian Ocean.
Significant sightings: First reported in 1613 as
a large white fowl by J. Tatton.
Willem Ysbrandsz Bontekoe described a dodo
on Reunion in 1619, referring to it as a Dod-
eersen, but he didn’t mention its color.
Hamon L’Estrange saw a light-colored dodo
on exhibit in London in 1638. It was bigger and
fatter than a turkey.
French visitors Carre in 1668 and Du Bois in
1669 reported turkey-sized birds on Reunion
that they referred to as solitaires. Du Bois said
the bird was white with black wing tips.
Governor Mahe de la Bourdonnais reportedly
sent a white dodo to France sometime between
1735 and 1746.
Possible explanations:
(1) Imported Dodo specimens from
Mauritius.
(2) Speculative or inaccurate depictions of
the Mauritius Dodo.
(3) A surviving ibis, Threskiornis solitarius;
this explanation became favored recently
after the bird’s fossil bones were discovered
on the island.

Rhinoceros Dolphin
Unknown CETACEAN of the North Pacific
Ocean.
Scientific names: Delphinus rhinoceros, given
by J. R. C. Quoy and J. P. Gaimard in 1824;
Cetodipteros rhinoceros, given by Michel Raynal
in 1991.
Physical description: Length, about 10 feet.
Upper body spotted black and white. Has two
dorsal fins — a standard dorsal fin in the center
of the back, supplemented by a second fin close
to the neck.
Significant sightings: The naturalists Quoy
and Gaimard observed a school of dolphins
with two dorsal fins in the North Pacific, possi-
bly in the neighborhood of Palmyra Atoll, in
October 1819. They did not get a good look at
the animals’ heads, which were under water.
In April 1856, one or two dolphins with two
dorsal fins were seen in a school of Common
dolphins ( Delphinus delphus) in Lantivet Bay,
Cornwall, England.
Possible explanation:
(1) Michel Raynal points out that the
animal might just as well be an unknown
beaked whale as a dolphin.
(2) A calf pressed tightly against its mother
might have been mistaken for a second
dorsal fin in the nearest animal; that all the
animals in the school had a similar
protrusion may have been a false
assumption.

Ri
Supposed MERBEING of Australasia.
Etymology: Barok (Austronesian) word.
Variant names: Ilkai (Sursurunga/ Austrone-
sian), Pishmeri (Pidgin, “fish-woman”).
Physical description: Dark or light-brown
body. Length, 5-7 feet. Human head, arms,
torso, and genitalia. Long head-hair. Eyes in the
front of the head. Protruding mouth. Females
have breasts. Arms are fused to the side of the
body. Palms are ridged and calloused, and the
fingernails are long and sharp. The lower trunk
terminates in a pair of flippers. Internal body fat
is said to be yellow.
Behavior: Aquatic. Swims horizontally and
rolls on the surface. Submergence time is about
ten minutes. Whistles or whispers. Humanlike
cry of fear. Eats fishes. Said to sleep on sandbars.
Barok fishermen will occasionally net and eat it.
Habitat: Shallow coastal water.
Distribution: New Ireland and Lihir Island,
Papua New Guinea, to Buka and Bougainville
Island, Solomon Islands; north coast of Papua
New Guinea.
Significant sightings: In November 1979, an-
thropologist Roy Wagner watched an animal
with a long, dark body swimming along the sur-
face of Ramat Bay, New Ireland. It disappeared
when a sawfish jumped out of the water in front
of it.
Gale Raymond, Roy Wagner, and Richard
Greenwell observed a Ri from a distance in Eliz-
abeth Bay, New Ireland, on July 5, 1983. The an-
imal surfaced for a few seconds at ten-minute in-
tervals. Expedition members caught glimpses of
the same or a similar animal on other occasions.
Attempts to capture a specimen with a net failed.
On February 10, 1985, members of an expedi-
tion sponsored by the Ecosophical Research As-
sociation and led by Thomas Williams observed
a Ri from the deck of their well-equipped diving
ship Reef Explorer. A local man identified the an-
imal as an Ilkai. Capt. Kerry Piesch went into the
water with scuba gear and photographed a green-
ish-gray, 5 -foot animal that moved underwater
gracefully with undulations of its tail. Other sur-
face and underwater observations convinced the
expedition members that they were seeing
dugongs. On February 15, they saw villagers
pulling a large animal that someone had killed
with a rifle out of the water off Nokon, New Ire-
land. It was conclusively identified as a dugong.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Dugong {Dugong dugori) , a sirenian
with a bulky body, moves slowly in the
water at an average 6 miles per hour. It does
occasionally roll on the surface. Its dive time
can extend to ten minutes. Adult males are
8 feet-9 feet 6 inches long and weigh
550-920 pounds. Australia has the largest
remaining dugong population in the world,
although the numbers have shrunk by
accidental capture and overhunting. New
Ireland was certainly part of the dugong’s
historical range, and the animal is still seen
in coastal areas of the Bismarck Sea. When
the animals are stressed by disturbance or
removal of the sea grass on which they feed,
dugongs are known to travel a long distance
away from their usual range. The 1985
Thomas Williams expedition conclusively
demonstrated that the animals called Ri or
Ilkai by the native people of Nokon Bay
were dugongs.
(2) The Finless porpoise {Neophocaema
phocaenoides) has a dorsal ridge but no fin.
Adults are 4-6 feet long. However, it is not
known in these waters; the closest it comes
is on the western coast of New Guinea. Tail
flukes are rarely visible above the surface. Its
submergence time is slightly over one
minute.
(3) The Southern rightwhale dolphin
{Lissodelphis peronii ) is only found in
temperate waters. It has a jet-black back and
a white underside. Adults are 6 feet-9 feet 6
inches long.
(4) A supposed Southern Hemisphere
variety of Beluga {Delphinapterus leucas ) ,
though this whale is lighter than the Ri
described in most reports. Belugas are
known only in Arctic waters.
RI 459
(5) An unknown population of Irrawaddy
dolphin ( Orcaella brevirostris) on the north
coast of New Guinea. It is known to
frequent coastal waters of northern Australia
and the southern coast of Papua New
Guinea. Adults are 7 feet— 8 feet 6 inches
long.

Rimi
Giant FfoMINID of Central Asia.
Etymology: Tibetan (Sino-Tibetan), “moun-
tain man,” ri (“mountain”) + mi (“man”).
Physical description: Black hair. Height, 7-9
feet. Big teeth. Flaming eyes.
Behavior: Eats roots, vegetables, and fruits.
Habitat: Altitudes of 10,000-13,000 feet.
Distribution: Tibet; eastern Nepal.
Significant sighting: Lama Chemed Rigdzin
Dorje Lopu claimed to have seen two mummi-
fied Rimis in 1953, one in Racaka Monastery,
Tibet.

Roa-Roa
Flightless Bird of New Zealand that might be a
surviving moa.
Etymology: Maori (Austronesian) word, also
used for the great spotted kiwi of South Island.
Variant names: Roa, Rua, Tokoweka.
Physical description: A kiwilike bird about the
size of a turkey, though larger birds have been
reported occasionally. Gray, blue, or spotted
plumage. Small head and beak. Long neck.
Sharp spurs on its feet.
Behavior: Call is similar to that of a kiwi.
Tracks: Three-toed. The middle toe measures
up to 14 inches from heel to tip.
Distribution: South Island, New Zealand; also
possibly in Urewera National Park on North Is-
land, New Zealand.
Significant sightings: George Pauley claimed
to have seen a bird 20 feet high by a lake in
southern South Island in the 1 820s.
Walter Buller wrote that the Maoris claimed
a large kiwi lived in the Chatham Islands until
about 1835.
In January 1861, fresh-looking, three-toed
prints about 14 inches long were found in the
mountains between Takaka and Riwaka in
northern South Island by members of a survey-
ing party.
Sir George Grey was told in 1868 about a
small moa captured and killed near Preservation
Inlet, North Island. It had been taken from a
drove of six or seven birds.
In 1878, several people reported seeing a sil-
ver-gray bird larger than an emu on a station
near Waiau, South Island. In one instance, a
sheepherder’s dog flushed the bird from a patch
of scrub and chased it for about 40 yards before
it turned and chased the dog. The moa stood for
ten minutes watching them, bending its long
neck up and down like a swan.
Seven-year-old Alice McKenzie touched a
big, navy-blue bird at Martin’s Bay, near Mil-
ford Sound, South Island, in 1880. It was at
least 3 feet tall and had dark-green, scaly legs
and three claws on each foot. It began to attack
her, so she ran home to get her father, who re-
turned and measured the tracks it left.
In 1896, some schoolboys saw a moalike bird
cross a road in the Brunner Range, South Is-
land.
In 1963, a scientist saw a large, moalike bird
in the brush in the North-West Nelson State
Lorest Park, South Island.
In May 1991, Jim Straton saw an enormous,
dark-colored bird cross a hiking trail in front of
him along the Waimakariri River. He estimated
its height at 1 1 feet.
460 RIMI
Moa skeletons and reconstructions in the Dunedin Museum, New Zealand. (From a postcard in the author’s collection)
Paddy Freaney and two other hikers pho-
tographed a 6-foot-tall moa in the Craigieburn
Range of South Island on January 20, 1993. It
was covered with reddish-brown and gray feath-
ers and had thick legs and huge feet. Their
blurry photo, snapped after the bird had started
running away, is inconclusive.
Rex and Heather Gilroy made plaster casts of
three- toed tracks, the largest of which were 9.5
inches long, that they found in September 2001
in Urewera National Park, North Island.
Possible explanations:
(1) A surviving species of the Moa family
(Dinornithidae), possibly the Upland moa
{Megalap teryx didinus ), which is generally
thought to have been exterminated by the
seventeenth century. Some Maori
informants suggest the bird may have
persisted into the late eighteenth century.
Relatively fresh remains were occasionally
found in the nineteenth century. M. didinus
stood about 3 feet 6 inches high, while the
Large bush moa {Dinornis novaezealandiae)
was 7 feet tall and the Stout-legged moa
{Eury apteryx geranoides) was about 6 feet
tall. Most of the alleged sightings by
Europeans date from 1850 to 1880. The
majority of Maori accounts of the final
extinction of the moa place it between 1770
and 1840, though 25 percent of them put it
prior to 1600. It seems increasingly unlikely
that such a distinctive bird could have
survived virtually unnoticed. Frequent moa
hunts have failed to turn up any sign of the
birds’ recent survival.
(2) An unknown species of Kiwi {Apteryx
spp.). A cloak made for a Maori chief has
kiwilike feathers that are larger than those of
any known kiwi.
(3) The Great spotted kiwi {Apteryx haasti)
only grows to 2 feet tall and does not have
spurs.
(4) The Takahe {Porphyrio hochstetteri ) is a
rare, flightless rail with blue plumage that
lives on South Island.

Roc
Mythical giant Bird of Madagascar or India.
Etymology: From the Arabic al-Rukhkh
(“giant bird”).
Variant names: Chrocko, Roche, Roque, Rue,
Rukh. The Roc spelling first appeared in an
1802 translation of Arabian Nights by Edward
Forster.
Physical description: Looks like a colossal
eagle. Wingspan, 48-90 feet. Each wing has
10,000 feathers, 6-36 feet long. Quills are 6
inches in circumference.
Behavior: Call is an ear-splitting cry. Feeds on
snakes and elephants. Said to pick up elephants
in its talons and drop them on the ground to kill
them. Nests on desolate islands. Lays one egg,
said to be 150 feet in circumference.
Distribution: Indian Ocean; Madagascar.
Significant sightings: Its first mention in Ara-
bic literature is in Buzurg ibn Shahriyar’s Ajd’ib
al-Hind, a tenth-century description of India.
The legendary Arabian sailor Sindbad es-
caped from an island by tying himself to the
talon of a Roc, which flew away and dropped
him off elsewhere.
Possible explanations:
(1) The legend is at least partially based on
travelers’ tales and rumors about the Giant
elephantbird ( Aepyornis maximus) of
Madagascar, which probably was still alive
when the French arrived on the island in
1642. This flightless bird stood 9-10 feet
tall and weighed around 960 pounds. Its
eggs were over a foot in length, had a
capacity equivalent to 150 hens’ eggs, and
constituted the largest single cell known on
earth. Arabian merchants started trading in
Madagascar in the ninth or tenth century
and may have seen Aepyornis eggs. Roc
feathers taken from the island might
actually have been the midrib of a leaf from
the Raffia palm ( Raphia farinifera) that
grows in Madagascar; the fronds are the
largest of any palm, easily growing 27-30
feet long. See VORONPATRA.
(2) A composite of characteristics of
vultures, peacocks, and eagles, as well as a
personification of waterspouts and other
bad weather.
(3) The only two eagles on Madagascar are
the Madagascar sea eagle ( Haliaeetus
vociferoides) and the extremely rare
Madagascar serpent eagle ( Eutriorchis astur);
both are only about 2 feet long and unlikely
giant bird candidates.
(4) The Kori bustard ( Ardeotis kori ) is a
long-necked, long-legged, elusive bird found
in East and South Africa. A ground dweller,
it flies rarely and reluctantly. Some
462 ROC

H. f. Ford. (Fortean Picture Library)
researchers believe it has reached the upper
size limit, 30-40 pounds, for a flying bird.
Its wingspan reaches 9 feet.
(5) Two smaller bustards, the Arabian (A.
arabs) and the Indian (A. nigriceps) , also
exceed 30 pounds.
(6) The Wandering albatross ( Diomedea
exulans ), found in waters to the south of
Madagascar, has the greatest wingspan of
any living bird (10-11 feet). An
unconfirmed wingspan of 17 feet 6 inches
was claimed for one specimen shot off the
Cape of Good Hope in the nineteenth
century.
(7) The Cape griffon vulture ( Gyps
coprotheres) of South Africa, with a
wingspan over 9 feet, is a Roc candidate.
(8) Eggs of the Ostrich ( Struthio camelus ),
the largest living flightless bird, probably
contributed to Roc lore. More than 6x5
inches in size, the eggs weigh an average of
3 pounds 10 ounces.

Rocky
Freshwater Monster of Wisconsin.
Etymology: After the lake.
Physical description: Spotted dark brown, like
a pickerel. Horselike head. Eyes like a snake’s.
Long neck.
Distribution: Rock Lake, Wisconsin.
Significant sightings: The earliest sighting was
in 1867. On August 28, 1882 (or 1887), Ed
McKenzie and D. W. Seybert were in a rowboat
race on the lake when they spotted a floating log
that turned out to be the head and neck of an
animal. The creature was as long as their boat
and the color of a pickerel.

RODENTS (Unknown)
The Order Rodentia contains more species, about
2,300, than any other mammalian order and in-
cludes the Squirrels (Sciuridae), Beavers (Castori-
dae), Pocket gophers (Geomyidae), Kangaroo rats
(Heteromyidae), Jerboas (Dipodidae), Rats and
Mice (Muridae), Scaly- tailed squirrels (Anom-
aluridae), Dormice (Myoxidae), Old World por-
cupines (Hystricidae), New World porcupines
(Erethizontidae), Guinea pigs (Caviidae), Agoutis
(Dasyproctidae), and Spiny rats (Echimyidae), as
well as a few other families. The most prominent
rodent feature is the single pair of large gnawing
teeth or incisors in each jaw. Certain rodent
groups have specialized in burrowing, swimming,
climbing, or gliding. All rely heavily on their sense
of smell. Some are well-known pests.
Rodents apparently originated in Asia during
the Paleocene, 60 million years ago. The largest
known rodent was the fossil North American
Giant beaver ( Castor oides ohioensis ), which
reached a length of 7 feet 6 inches. The world’s
largest living rodent is the Capybara ( Hy -
drochaeris hydrochaeris) of South America,
which grows to 4 feet 6 inches.
464 ROCKY
Rodent cryptids are few and far between. A
GlANT Beaver surviving into historical times is
the most straightforward. Others involve mice
masquerading as the Devil, an underground
Scottish rat, marmots confused with ants, and a
rodentlike British animal that may actually have
been a coati.

Rommie
Freshwater Monster of Norway.
Etymology: After Lake Romsjoen.
Physical description: Body is thick as a log.
Grayish-black. Head like a calf s. Protruding
ears. Two to five humps, about 5 feet apart. Fin-
like tail.
Behavior: Swims with a serpentine motion.
Occasionally seen on land.
Distribution: Romsjoen, Ostfold County,
Norway.
Significant sightings: In 1929, Astrid Myrvold
watched a large, black animal move from the
shore through some vegetation into the lake. It
had protruding ears and a finlike tail, and it left
a large wake behind it.
On September 20, 1976, school bus driver As-
bjorn Holmedal and fifteen children saw an ani-
mal about 23-33 feet long splashing water in the
lake between the mainland and Bjornoya Island.

Ropen
Flying Reptile of Australasia.
Etymology: An Austronesian word said to
mean “demon flyer.”
Variant name: Duah.
Physical description: Bony crest on the head.
Long jaws. Sharp teeth. Long neck. Leathery
wings. Wingspan, 3-20 feet. Glowing under-
parts. Long tail with diamond-shaped fringe.
Behavior: Nocturnal. Attracted to decaying
flesh. Said to attack funeral gatherings and fish-
ing vessels in search of fishes.
Habitat: Caverns.
Distribution: Rambutyo Island, Bismarck
Archipelago, Papua New Guinea; Goodenough
and Umboi Islands, Papua New Guinea; the Solo-
mon Islands; the Papua New Guinea mainland.
Significant sightings: About 1989, a man was
fishing with a companion at night on the east-
ern side of Rambutyo Island when one of these
creatures swooped down from the sky and at-
tacked their boat. They jumped into the water
to avoid it, and the animal hit the boat, splashed
around in the water for a while, then flew away.
Villagers of Gumalong, Umboi Island, saw a
Duah fly from Mount Bel and out to sea in
1995.
A missionary on the Papuan mainland saw a
Ropen as it flew by a lake in 1995.

Row
Fanciful DINOSAUR of Australasia.
Etymology: From the hiss it makes, “roooow.”
Physical description: Length, 30-40 feet. Light
brown-yellow in color. Small head with a bony
collar like a ceratopsian dinosaur’s. No horns.
Beak like a snapping turtle’s. Extended neck and
tail like a diplodocid dinosaur’s. Large, bony
plates on its back like a stegosaurian dinosaur’s
but in a single row. A single defensive spike at
the end of its tail.
Behavior: Can rear up on its hind legs. Hisses
angrily.
ROW 465
Habitat: Marshy area on top of a plateau.
Distribution: Merauke Subdistrict of Irian
Jaya, Indonesia.
Significant sighting: On his honeymoon in the
1930s, Charles Miller discovered a still un-
known tribe of head-hunting cannibals called
the Kirrirri, who used an odd animal “tusk” as
an implement. The Kirrirri took him to a re-
mote spot to show him the animal it came from,
which turned out to be a dinosaur. The tusk was
the spike from a Row’s tail.
Possible explanation: Most likely a hoax. The
Row is made up of components of very different
dinosaur groups. Much of Miller’s travelogue is
unlikely, such as his participation in a cannibal
feast and a head-hunting raid.

Rusalka
MERBEING of Eastern Europe and Russia.
Etymology: Russian, “mermaid.” Plural,
Rusdlki.
Variant names: Chertovka (“she-devil”),
Khitka (“abductor”), Loskotukha (“tickler”),
Nemodilky (Czech), Samovila (Bulgarian),
Shutovka (“she-joker”),Vila (Slavonic).
Physical description: Pale, slender, and cadav-
erous. Sometimes appears as a fair maiden with
green or garlanded hair. Beautiful and sirenlike
in southeastern Europe; unkempt and unattrac-
tive in Northern Europe and the Saratov Region
of Russia. Uncombed or disheveled green hair.
Green eyes. Magnificent white breasts. Winged.
Behavior: Nocturnal. Lives in the forest dur-
ing the summer and in the water the rest of the
year. Frolics in willow and birch trees, sings, and
dances a circle dance in the moonlight. Cries
and laughs shrilly. Sometimes wears a covering
of green leaves. Seizes and drowns passing hu-
mans, sometimes tickling them to death. Leads
cattle astray. Said to be the spirit of a drowned
woman. Dislikes absinthe.
Habitat: Rivers and streams; forests.
Distribution: Danube, Dnieper, and Volga
River systems in Russia and Eastern Europe.
Significant sighting: The Russian novelist Ivan
Turgenev was said to have told his friends Guy
de Maupassant and Gustave Flaubert a story of
meeting a female water being. It happened in
his youth, perhaps in the 1830s or 1840s, in the
dense forests around the Desna River, Ukraine,
where he used to hunt. He was taking a relaxing
swim when a hand touched his shoulder. He
turned and saw a monkeylike woman with long,
tousled hair whose breasts floated in the water.
It chased him to the shore, cackling and touch-
ing his legs and back. Turgenev ran off without
retrieving his clothes or gun.
Possible explanation: The remnant of a belief
in the Mokosh’, the Old Slavic goddess of fer-
tility and protectress of women.

Fish-tailed MERBEING of eastern Canada.
Etymology: Micmac (Algonquian), “water-
dwelling people.”
Variant name: Halfway people.
Physical description: Upper part human, lower
part fish.
Behavior: Sings before a storm.
Distribution: Nova Scotia; New Brunswick.
Significant sighting: In 1870, a Micmac In-
dian found a Sabawaelnu child stranded after a
high tide. Its head was about 3 inches across,
and it had tiny hands. The Micmac carried it
back to deep water.

Sachamama
Giant SNAKE of South America.
Etymology: Quechuan, “mother of the earth.”
Physical description: Black snake. Length, 132
feet. Width, 1 5 feet. Two pairs of snail-like feel-
ers at the base and the tip of the snout. Conch-
like shell on its back.
Behavior: Uproots trees. Said to remain dor-
mant for many years.
Distribution: Amazon jungle, Peru.
Significant sighting: A large snake is said to
have disrupted a soccer game and other activities
in the Peruvian village of Nuevo Tacna on Au-
gust 14, 1997. Maximo Inuacari watched as a
black monster emerged from the jungle and
dived into the Rio Napo, leaving behind a
1,600-foot-long, 30-foot-wide trench in the
mud and submerging several boats. Several hun-
dred people felt the earth tremble. The mayor of
Maynas County, Jorge Chavez Sibina, flew over
the area by helicopter with Peruvian radio jour-
nalist Carlos Villareal shortly afterward to sur-
vey the devastation.

Significant sightings: In 255 B.C. during the
First Punic War, after a lengthy struggle in
which catapults and siege engines were put to
use, the legions of Roman consul Marius Atilius
Regulus killed an enormous snake, 120 feet
long, along the Wadi Majardah in Tunisia. Its
skin and jaws were taken to Rome and publicly
displayed in a temple until 133 B.C.
Africanus Leo wrote in the sixteenth century
that large, venomous dragons lived in caves in
the Atlas Mountains in North Africa.
467
Charles Tissot wrote in 1884 about a ven-
omous snake in the Tunisian Sahara called the
Taguerga, which grows 12-15 feet long.
In 1958, Belkhouriss Abd el-Khader, an Al-
gerian who served in the French army at Beni
Ounif, Algeria, was bitten by a giant snake
about 43 feet long. The snake was killed and its
skin preserved, though it has since been lost.
In 1959, a 120-foot snake with a crest 3 feet
long was killed at a garrison near Am Sefra, Al-
geria, by a French battalion, the Twenty-Sixth
Dragoons, commanded by Captains Grassin
and Laveau. It had been trapped in a trench
filled with branches by nomads and had just
eaten a camel. The soldiers’ carbines were not
sufficient to kill it, so they dispatched it with
machine guns.
On January 6 or 7, 1967, a crested serpent
about 30 feet long was seen at the construction
site of the Djorf-Torba dam east of Bechar, Al-
geria, by worker Hamza Rahmani, who wedged
it against some rocks with his bulldozer. Its
teeth were hooked and nearly 2.5 inches long.
At Djorf-Torba in late 1967, Hamza Rah-
mani came across the track of a snake leading to
barrels of oil that it had been in the habit of
drinking. A few days later, he saw the snake
coiled in the shadow of a pile of crushed rock.
He estimated its length as 18-23 feet.
Possible explanations:
(1) The African rock python ( Python sebae ),
though it only reaches a length of 30-33
feet. It lives in forests south of the Sahara,
not in the desert, but it is possible some
may subsist in remote pockets of tropical
vegetation in North Africa. A Dr. Bougon
thought that the Punic War snakeskin may
actually have been a python’s intestine,
which would be 120 feet long in a 33-foot
snake. Charles Tissot thought the skin may
have been artificially stretched.
(2) The venomous Puff adder ( Bitis
arietans ), which lives in southern Morocco
and grows to only 4 feet 6 inches but can
appear much larger.
(3) The Horned viper ( Cerastes cerastes ),
though it is only about 2 feet long.
(4) An exaggerated Levantine viper ( Vipera
lebetina ), known in Arabic as taguerjah.
(5) An unknown species of viper 7 feet
long, based on the size of the teeth
recovered from the Djorf-Torba snake, if it
was venomous. The small Many-horned
viper ( Bitis cornuta) of South Africa has a
small crest.
(6) An unknown species of python 33-48
feet long, also based on the size of the
Djorf-Torba teeth, if they came from a
nonvenomous snake.
(7) A surviving Gigantophis garstini y a North
African python that reached 30 feet and
lived 55 million years ago.

St. Helena Manatee
Unknown SlRENIAN or SEAL of the South At-
lantic Ocean.
Physical description: Length, 10 feet. Yellow-
ish color. Large, green eyes. Wide jaws with
large teeth. Bristly mustache.
Behavior: Rests or sleeps on rocks on the
shore.
Distribution: The island of St. Helena.
Significant sightings: In 1655, Cornish traveler
Peter Mundy found a dying, 1 0-foot animal that
he called a “sea lion” on the beach near Chappell
Valley. Other animals that were called “sea
cows” were occasionally found by residents of St.
Helena (and killed for oil) until 1810, when the
last one was shot at Stone Top Valley beach.
Present status: Not reported since 1810.
468 ST. HELENA MANATEE
Possible explanations:
(1) An unknown species of manatee that,
unlike any known species, has the ability to
come ashore.
(2) The West African ( Trichechus
senegalensis) and West Indian ( T. manatus)
manatees are not likely to be carried so far
into the South Atlantic on a regular basis.
(3) The South African fur seal
( Arctocephalus pusillus ), suggested by
Theodor Mortensen, though it is
nonmigratory and rarely strays far from the
coast of South Africa and Namibia.
(4) The Southern elephant seal ( Mirounga
leonina :), suggested by F. C. Fraser, is an
occasional visitor to St. Helena.

al-Salaawa
Unidentified HYENA-like animal of North
Africa.
Etymology: Arabic, “she-wolf.”
Variant names: al-Salaawwa, Salawa, Silawa.
Physical description: Like a large hyena. Beige
or black fur. Long muzzle. Prominent fangs.
Tail like a wolf s.
Behavior: Nocturnal. Attacks and kill hu-
mans, especially children.
Habitat: Desert areas.
Distribution: Armant, in southern Egypt; the
Cairo suburbs.
Significant sightings: In October 1996, Egyp-
tian police shot two wild dogs that had killed
four children and wounded twenty-eight others
in Armant, Egypt.
Savage dogs attacked twenty-three children in
Qattamiya, an eastern suburb of Cairo, Egypt, in
March 1997. The Egyptian press published pho-
tos showing the disfigured children, some of
whom had lost both eyes. On April 7, twenty-
three-year-old Sayeda Abbas and other residents
stoned to death a wolflike creature. A preliminary
postmortem indicated it was a dog-wolf hybrid.
Possible explanations: Feral Domestic dogs
( Canis familiaris) , Common jackals ( Canis au-
reus ), and Striped hyenas ( Hyaena hyaena) are all
found in the area, though they do not usually
attack people.

Salamander
Lizardlike animal of Europe that is immune to
fire; see SEMIMYTHICAL BEASTS.
Scientific name: Pyrosalamandra gustavense,
given semiseriously by W. S. Home in 1979.
Etymology: From the Greek salamandra.
Physical description: Small, wingless lizard.
Behavior: Its cold skin is said to put out fire.
It throws up a white, toxic substance. Breeds in
the hottest part of a fire.
Significant sightings: Artist Benvenuto Cellini
saw a small, lizardlike creature dancing in the
flames of his father’s hearth in Florence, Italy, in
1505.
Biologist W. S. Home saw a salamander-like
apparition in a woodstove fire in a cabin at Gus-
tavus, Alaska, on January 30, 1978. About 3
inches long with a narrow head and tail, the
smoldering red biomorph uncoiled out of the
ashes and moved about 15 inches before being
consumed by flame. Although it was actually a
burning spruce twig, Home was impressed with
its resemblance to a living amphibian.
SALAMANDER 469
The fiery SALAMANDER was an emblem of King Francis I of France. (From a postcard in the author’s collection)
Present status : The legend that Salamanders
were immune to fire lingered until the early
eighteenth century.
Possible explanations:
(1) Members of the well-known amphibian
family of Salamanders (Salamandridae) lead
an aquatic life as larvae and a terrestrial life
as adults. They have a characteristically
cylindrical tail. The Fire salamander
(. Salamandra salamandrd) is found in hilly
regions throughout Central and Southern
Europe. It derives its name from a skin
secretion that is toxic to small animals.
(2) The fire-retarding substance asbestos was
long thought to be Salamander wool.
(3) Burning wood can be animated briefly
by convection currents and appear
remarkably lifelike.

Sandewan
Mystery animal of South Africa, possibly a
HYRAX.
Physical description: Presumably small or
medium-sized. Completely unknown morphol-
ogy, since it is known only from its trail.
Tracks: A trail of bloody spots, 1-2 inches
across, that passes under low branches and
through narrow crevices.
Habitat: Rocky outcrops.
Distribution: Chizarira National Park, Zim-
babwe.
Significant sighting: Zoologist Carina Norris
examined one of these bloody trails in the sum-
mer of 1997.
Possible explanation: A hyrax of some kind,
based on its preference for a rocky habitat,
though hyraxes are herbivorous.

Sansandryi
Small Hominid of West Africa.
Etymology: Diola (Atlantic).
Physical description: Small size. Muscular.
Behavior: Walks backwards to conceal its
movements. Steals rags from villages for cloth-
ing.
Habitat: Deep forest.
Distribution: Casamance River, Senegal.

Santer
Mystery big Cat of North Carolina.
Etymology: Possibly originated with J. P.
Caldwell, editor of the Statesville (TV. C. ) Weekly ,
in 1890.
Physical description: Gray cat, with stripes
from end to end.
Behavior: Fond of eating cats, dogs, and live-
stock.
Distribution: Iredell and Wilkes Counties,
Roaring River, Elkin, and Piney Grove, in
North Carolina.
Significant sightings: Tongue-in-cheek stories
first cropped up in Iredell County from August
to October 1890. Later, more matter-of-fact
tales circulated in Yakin County in 1897 and
Wilkes County in 1899. Most newspaper ac-
counts were vague about who saw what and
when. A mystery animal reported in south
Iredell County in May 1934 was said to be a
Santer or its offspring.
Possible explanations:
(1) Newspaper hoaxes to terrorize African-
American residents and their children.
(2) Mystery cats, feral Domestic cats ( Felis
silvestris catus ), hybrids, or EASTERN PUMAS
that were sighted later may have been
assigned the name Santer in memory of the
hoax.

472 SANDEWAN
Sasa
Unknown Bird of Oceania.
Etymology: Fijian (Austronesian) word.
Physical description: Chicken-sized ground
bird. Speckled.
Distribution: Viti Levu and Kandavu Islands,
Fiji.
Present status: Probably extinct.
Possible explanation: Undescribed species of
Megapode (Family Megapodiidae), a group of
scrub hens and brush turkeys that build mounds
in which their eggs are incubated, suggested by
Karl Shuker. These birds are found in Australia
and the Pacific Islands.

1928, an Asante man named Agya Wuo killed a
Sasabonsam and took it into his town. He had
found it sleeping in a tree hollow, and it had
emitted a deep cry. The carcass was allegedly
photographed by the region’s district commis-
sioner, L. W. Wood.
In the 1930s, J. B. Danquah obtained a wood
sculpture of a Sasabonsam, carved by Asante
artist Osei-Bonsu.
Possible explanations:
(1) A large, undescribed species of bat.
(2) A surviving pterosaur, a group of winged
reptiles that lived from the Late Jurassic to
the end of the Cretaceous, 150-65 million
years ago.
(3) A spirit based on certain real and
imagined characteristics of the Gorilla
( Gorilla gorilla ) .

Sasquatch
GlANT Hominid of northwestern North Amer-
ica, synonymous with BlGFOOT.
Etymology: Coined by J. W. Burns in the
1920s as an anglicization of Sokqueatl or Soss-
q’tal, Halkomelem (Salishan) words referring to
a “timber giant” or CANNIBAL GlANT.
Variant names: Sami ‘Soq’ wia’m (Chehalis/
Salishan), Saskehavis, Sokqueatl (Halkomelem/

Sat-Kalauk
Alleged mystery Cat of Southeast Asia.
Variant name: Nabashing.
Behavior: Leaps onto the necks of Sambar
deer ( Cervus unicolor) and sucks their blood.
Distribution: Mandalay Division and Kachin
State, Myanmar.
Probable explanation: In 1954, a Sat-kalauk
was captured near Myatkyina and identified as a
Yellow- throated marten (. Martes flavigula ), a
weasel-like animal with a distinctive, yellow
throat patch.

Satyr
Mythical WlLDMAN of Southern Europe. In its
earliest form, it was a Greek elemental spirit of
the forests and mountains. Later, it came to rep-
resent the undeveloped, bestial state of human-
ity or, alternatively, an idyllic past. Satyrs were
the companions of the wine god Dionysus.
Etymology: From the Greek satyros, of uncer-
tain origin, though possibly derived from the
Hebrew se’ir (“hairy demon”).
Variant names: Fatui ficarii, Faun, Pan,
SlLENUS.
Physical description: Covered with hair. Low
forehead. Small horns. Monkeylike face.
Pointed ears. Snub nose. Full lips. Long beard.
Legs, hooves, and tail of a goat or horse.
Behavior: Found in small groups. Lascivious.
Loves to dance. Plays music on reed pipes (sy-
rinx) or cymbals. Terrorizes shepherds and trav-
elers.
Habitat: Woodlands.
Distribution: Northern Greece; Egypt;
Turkey; India; other remote islands and lands.
Significant sightings: In the fifth century B.C.,
the hide of a Satyr named Marsyas was a famous
tourist attraction near the source of the
Menderes River in south-central Turkey.
In 86 B.C., a Satyr was found sleeping in a
meadow called the Nymphaeum, near Durres,
Albania, and taken to the Roman general Lu-
cius Cornelius Sulla, who was passing through
the area after sacking Athens in the First
Mithridatic War. The Satyr’s speech could not
be understood and sounded like a neighing or
bleating.
Euphemus the Carian was blown off course
to an unknown island in the Mediterranean that
was populated by Satyrs. The creatures had red
hair and horse’s tails, and as soon as Euphemus
landed, they tried to rape the women on board
his ship.
St. Jerome reported that in the early fourth
century, Emperor Constantine traveled to An-
takya, Turkey, to view the remains of a Satyr
that had been preserved in salt.
Possible explanations:
(1) A symbol of precivilized, Neolithic
Greece.
(2) Early Greek tribal groups who followed
the god Pan and revered goats as their
totem animals.
(3) Folk memory of Neanderthals ( Homo
neanderthalensis) or archaic Homo sapiens.
(4) An imaginative explanation for fossils of
large vertebrates that are occasionally found
in Greece and Turkey.
(5) Indian Satyrs may have been based on
monkeys.
(6) As early as the fifth century B.C., cleverly
manufactured Satyr masks for Greek
dramatic performances were made from hair
and skins. Fake Satyrs were probably created
as tourist attractions out of human
474 SAT-KALAUK
mummies fitted with such masks and other
stage props.

Sawtooth Dolphin
Mystery freshwater CETACEAN of South Amer-
ica.
Variant name: Holadeira.
Physical description: Large freshwater dolphin
resembling the Boto but with a dorsal fin that
has notches like a saw.
Distribution: Amazon River basin, Brazil.
Significant sightings: A Sawtooth dolphin was
observed and photographed twice in 1993 and
1994 by Jeremy Wade in an unnamed lake in
the Amazon basin. Wade also heard rumors of

river.
Possible explanation: A Boto dolphin (Inia ge-
ojfrensis) injured by a net or propellor blade,
though Wade said the notches appeared pre-
cisely spaced.

Say-No th-Kai
Sea MONSTER of the Pacific Northwest coast.
Etymology: Coast Salish (Salishan) word.
Physical description: Has two heads.
Distribution: Coast of British Columbia,
Canada; Washington.

Scarfe
BLACK Dog of eastern England.
Etymology: From the Old English sceorfan (“to
bite or gnaw”) or the Old High German scarpon
(“to cut to shreds”).
Variant names: Old Scarpe, Skeff.
Behavior: Menacing and dangerous.
Distribution: Norfolk and Suffolk.

Schelch
Giant, deerlike HOOFED MAMMAL of Central
Europe.
Etymology: Middle High German word. This
term, used in the Nibelungenlied (Adventure
16), is considered by some authorities to refer to
a giant deer alive in Austria in the Middle Ages.
Variant name: Sheik.
Significant sightings: Giant deer (. Megaloceros
or Eucladoceros) are depicted in Late Paleolithic
(25,000-12,000 years ago) cave art in France
and Spain. Scythian artifacts from the Black Sea
region dating from the sixth century B.C. may
also show these animals or at least indicate
knowledge of fossil deer remains; the antlers are
a close match to those of a Megaloceros. See IRISH
Deer.

Schomburgk’s Deer
A surviving population of this deer (a HOOFED
Mammal) has been reported in Laos. It has been
presumed extinct in Thailand since 1932 be-
cause of hunting and habitat loss.
Scientific name: Cervus schomburgki, given by
Blyth in 1863.
Physical description: Length, 6 feet. Shoulder
height, 3 feet 6 inches. Chocolate-brown. Elab-
orately branched antlers with a large number of
points (up to thirty- three) .
Distribution: Laos. Formerly known from the
Chao Phraya River valley, Thailand.
Significant sighting: Antlers were found in
February 1991 by agronomist Laurent Chazee
in a Laotian medicine shop whose owner said
they came from a deer killed one year earlier in
a nearby district.
Present status: The last known wild stag was
killed in Thailand in September 1932 by a po-
lice officer. The last known captive specimen,
an adult male kept as a pet at a temple in Samut
Sakhon Province, Thailand, was killed by a
drunken local in 1938.

Sciapod
WlLDMAN of North Africa or India.
Etymology: Greek, “shadow foot.”
Variant name: Steganopod.
Physical description: Only one leg. Its foot is
so large that when the creature is seated it can be
lifted up and used as a parasol, hence the name
“shadow foot.”
Distribution: Egypt or India.
Possible explanation: It is tempting to identify
this creature as a GlANT HOMINID, but it is
more likely the product of a confused account
by people in the Tropics who were resting under
palm trees.

Scott’s Dolphin
Unknown CETACEAN of South America.
Physical description: Dolphin-sized. Brown
back. White below.
Distribution: Strait of Magellan, Chile.
Significant sighting: Peter Scott observed two
specimens in a school of Commerson’s dolphins
(< Cephalorhynchus commersonii ) in the Strait of
Magellan on February 4, 1968.
Possible explanation: The Black dolphin
( Cephalorhynchus eutropia), one of the smallest
cetaceans, ranges from the Strait of Magellan
north to Valparaiso, Chile. It has a white belly
and a dark-gray body that may appear brown,
tan, or gray at sea. Adults are 4 feet-5 feet 4
inches long.

Scrag Whale
Mystery CETACEAN of the North Atlantic
Ocean.
Etymology: Scrag, meaning lean or bony, was a
term applied to whales that were hungry, dying,
or lingering around the coast.
Scientific name: Balaena gibbosa, given by Jo-
hann Polycarp Erxleben in 1777.
Physical description: Similar to a Fin whale
(. Balaeonoptera physalus) but with knobs on its
back instead of a dorsal fin.
Distribution: North Atlantic Ocean.
Significant sighting: According to legend, the
first whale the white settlers of Nantucket Is-
land, Massachusetts, encountered was a Scrag
476 SCHOMBURGK’S DEER
whale that lingered in the harbor for three days
in the 1670s. The settlers knew they had to try
to capture it, but to accomplish this, a black-
smith had to fashion the island’s first harpoon.
Possible explanations:
(1) At one time, it was thought to be a
juvenile Northern right whale ( Eubalaena
glacialis ) .
(2) Now universally considered to have been
a North Atlantic population of the Gray
whale ( Eschrichtius robustus ), hunted to
extinction by the eighteenth century. A
subfossil jaw discovered in 1977 at
Southampton, New York, was identified in
1984 as a gray whale radiocarbon-dated to
approximately 1710. This species is
currently found only in the Pacific.

Sea Monk
Odd-looking CEPHALOPOD or FlSH.
Variant names: JENNY HANIVER, Monachus
marinus, Monkfish, Sea bishop.
Physical description: Sea animal with human
features resembling a monk. Length, 8 feet.
Head is like a man’s, with a monk’s tonsure.
Body is a scarlet color with speckles. Upper
body is covered by a cape. Two long fins instead
of arms. Broad, bilobate tail.
Behavior: Makes a sighing noise.
Distribution: Oresund, Denmark.
Significant sighting: In 1 546, a monklike fish
was caught in the Oresund Strait off Mahno,
Sweden. It lived in captivity for three days.
Possible explanations:
(1) A squid of some kind, possibly a small
Architeuthis, suggested by Japetus Steenstrup
in 1854.
(2) A curio manufactured from various sea
creatures. Similar to a JENNY HANIVER.

SEA MONSTERS
Enormous, often serpentine animals reported in
the ocean worldwide, both near coasts and on
the high seas. It is probable that many different
types of animals — known and unknown — are
responsible for sightings, making it extremely
difficult to extract a uniform description.
Scientific names: Halsydrus pontoppidani,
given by Patrick Neill in 1809; Megophias mon-
strosus , first proposed in 1817 by Constantin S.
Rafinesque and modified to Megophias
megophias in 1892 by A. C. Oudemans; Pelamis
monstrosus y also suggested by Rafinesque in
1817 for another variety.
Variant names: Beisht kione (Manx), Bled-
mall (Irish), Cirein croin (Gaelic, “gray crest”),
Great sea-serpent, Great unknown of the seas,
Mester stoorworm (Orkney Islands), Physeter
(Greek, “the blower”), Sea serpent, Sjo-orm
(Norwegian, “sea worm”), Sjo-orm (Swedish),

Physical description: Characteristics are so vari-
able that it is necessary to refer to the schemes
proposed by authors who have attempted to cat-
alog and classify some specific types. The most
important are those by A. C. Oudemans,
Bernard Heuvelmans, Paul H. LeBlond and
John Sibert, and Gary Mangiacopra.
Oudemans type: In 1892, the Dutch zoologist
Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans examined 162 re-
ports of Sea serpents between 1522 and 1890
and concluded that most of them could be ex-
plained by a single hypothetical animal — specif-
ically, a long-necked SEAL, 50-100 feet long,
with a serpentine tail, four flippers, large eyes, a
mane, and whiskers. Christening it Megophias
megophiaSy Oudemans thought such an animal
(for which there is no evidence in the fossil
record) could equally explain sightings of long-
necked animals, elongated animals with many
humps, and serpentine animals. As Heuvelmans
commented later, Oudemans erred by not ad-
mitting that there could be more than one kind
of Sea monster.
Heuvelmans types: In the 1960s, Bernard
Heuvelmans examined 587 Sea monster sight-
ings from 1639 to 1966 and concluded that
there were at least nine different types of un-
known animals involved. (For more detailed de-
scriptions, see each of the categories in the fol-
lowing list.)
(1) The LONGNECK, a mammal with a long,
slender, flexible neck similar to that of some
Freshwater Monsters reported in lakes
and rivers. Heuvelmans classified this as an
extremely elongated SEAL adapted for a
purely marine existence.
(2) The MERHORSE, a mammal with a
horselike head and large eyes, also classified
as a seal adapted for semiabyssal depths.
(3) The Multihumped Sea Monster, a
mammal with a string of dorsal humps
forming a ridge on its back. Heuvelmans
took this to be an archaic CETACEAN, such
as the especially elongated family of
basilosaurids, or an early cetacean from a
group not found in the fossil record.
(4) The Multifinned Sea Monster, a
mammal with lateral, finlike projections on
both sides of its body, also taken by
Heuvelmans to be an early whale of some
type.
(5) The Super-Otter, a rough-skinned

Scandinavian Sea MONSTER. From Olaus Magnus, A Compendious History of the Goths, Swedes and Vandals
(1554). (Fortean Picture Library)
mammal with a distinct head and a tapering
tail, possibly an archaic whale earlier in the
cetacean lineage than the basilosaurids.
(6) Super-Eels, which comprise at least two
kinds of serpentine FISHES with tapering
tails, one mottled and another dark above
and light below. Heuvelmans was led astray
by his assumption that the 6-foot
leptocephalus found by the oceanographic
research vessel Dana in 1930 represented
the larval stage of a huge eel. In addition to
giant, eel-like bony fishes, he also postulated
a large, serpentine shark similar to the Frill
shark ( Chlamydoselachus anguineus),
primarily to accommodate CAPTAIN
Hanna’s Fish.
(7) The Marine Saurian, a huge, seagoing
CROCODILIAN, possibly a surviving, long-
snouted thalattosuchian reptile or a
surviving mosasaur.
(8) The Father-of-All-the-Turtles, an
enormous, unrecognized species of oceanic
Turtle.
(9) The YELLOW-BELLY, a yellow, tadpole-
shaped tropical animal that might be either
a Fish or an Amphibian.
Not all of Heuvelmans’s categories and iden-
tifications have stood up well over time. His as-
sumption that the reptilian plesiosaurs must
have been cold-blooded is now seen as not so
strict a requirement, leaving open the possibility
that the LONGNECK or MERHORSE could be ex-
plained as a marine reptile rather than a hypo-
thetical seal. His theory that early whales
(basilosaurids) had armored plates is now re-
garded as incorrect. CETACEAN taxonomy has
undergone much evolution since the 1960s,
with recent molecular studies showing whales to
have emerged either directly from the artio-
dactyls (cattle, deer, and pigs) or indirectly
through the mesonychids, the first large postdi-
nosaur Hoofed Mammals. Also, doubt has
been cast on his SUPER-OTTER as an accurate
description of Hans Egede’s classic sighting. Ul-
rich Magin contends that Heuvelmans had dif-
ficulty assigning many detailed sightings to a
particular category and would often shoehorn a
report into a category based on geographic loca-
tion alone.
After a preliminary analysis of 1,247 Sea
monster sightings in 2001, researcher Bruce A.
Champagne identified 351 credible observa-

Illustrated London News (two views). (From the original in the Northwestern University Library)
tions, which he sorted into three categories sim-
ilar to those of Heuvelmans — Long-necked (8.6
percent), Eel-like (26.2 percent), and Multi-
humped (14.5 percent) — in addition to uniden-
tified animals (28.2 percent) and unclassifiable
animals (22.5 percent).
LeBlond and Sibert types: In 1973, oceanogra-
phers Paul H. LeBlond and John Sibert looked
at 30 CADDY sightings and strandings off British
Columbia, Canada, from 1892 to 1969 and
identified three kinds of animals, the first two
being the commonest.
(1) An animal similar to Heuvelmans’s
LONGNECK, with small eyes and horns on
the head, except it appears to have a mane.
(2) A large-eyed animal like Heuvelmans’s
MERHORSE but without a mane.
(3) A coiled, serpentine animal somewhat
like the MULTIHUMPED SEA MONSTER, with
a jagged fin along its back and a sheeplike
head.
Mangiacopra types: After studying sixty-four
reports from the nineteenth century, Gary Man-
giacopra concluded that there were four types of
Sea monster. (For more detailed descriptions,
see each of the categories in the following list.)
(1) The Dorsal Finner, roughly
comparable to Heuvelmans’s
Multihumped Sea Monster.
Mangiacopra seemed to have dropped this
category when he went on to look at
twentieth-century reports.
(2) The MANER, a ringer for the
Merhorse.
(3) A HORN Head, probably the same as
the LONGNECK.
(4) A Multicoiled Sea Monster, which
Mangiacopra equated with Heuvelmans’s
Super-Eels, though the similarity seems
forced. While there are some differences,
this animal seems closer to the
Multihumped Sea Monster.
Mangiacopra apparently gave up on these cat-
egories, as sightings (especially after 1947)
seemed to offer poor fits. In general, post- 1947
descriptions resemble the Multicoiled animal
but with different body proportions.
Significant sightings: In the ancient and me-
dieval world, Europeans had vague notions of
the existence of large marine animals based on
classical myths, travelers’ tales, dragon legends,
and zoological fables. The best known were the
Leviathan of the Bible and the Laocoon Ser-
pent and KETOS of the Greeks.
In 1554, Olaus Magnus wrote that sailors
often encountered an enormous black Sea ser-
pent 200 feet long and 20 feet thick in the fjords
off Bergen, Norway.
In 1687, a Sea serpent was seen in calm
weather by a group of eleven people in the
Dramsfjorden south of Oslo, Norway. It took
“some time in stretching out its many folds.”
In August 1746, Capt. Lorenz von Ferry and
his crew came across a Sea serpent off Molde,
More og Romsdal County, Norway. They
rowed close to the animal, and von Ferry fired
at it with his ship’s gun, whereupon it sank out
of sight. It had a horselike head, large black eyes,
and a white mane. The body consisted of seven
or eight coils.
On August 6, 1848, Capt. Peter M’Quhae and
officers of the HMS Daedalus saw a 60-foot ser-
pentine animal in the South Atlantic Ocean
about 300 miles off the coast of Namibia. It kept
its head and short neck about 4 feet above the sur-
face of the water. The animal moved at a steady
speed in the water and was about 600 feet away at
the closest point. The color was dark brown, with
yellowish-white on the throat. A horselike mane
or dorsal fin was visible on its back. They watched
it for five minutes with the naked eye and fifteen
more minutes through a spyglass.
The British ship Imogen was in the
mid-North Atlantic about 1,000 miles west of
the Canary Islands on March 30, 1856, when
the crew noticed a long wake about 400 yards to
starboard. Through a telescope, it appeared to
be a Sea serpent about 40 feet long with a series
of humps on its back. As it swam away, it lifted
its head several times as if to look at the ship.
Commander Hugh L. Pearson and the crew
of the royal yacht Osborne encountered a 30-
foot Sea monster with a ridge of fins along its
back swimming away from their vessel on the
early evening of June 2, 1877, off San Vito lo
Capo, Sicily, Italy. The fins seemed about 5-6
feet high, the head was bullet-shaped, and there
were two lateral flappers about 1 5 feet long.

Alfred Ford Mathews was on the steamer
Manapouri on July 14, 1891, when he saw a Sea
serpent north of East Cape, North Island, New
Zealand. It raised its head and neck out of the
water several times, showing two long ap-
pendages, or “armlets,” that dangled loosely.
On August 18, 1901, First Officer F. Wolfe,
in charge of the Chinese customs launch Lung-
tsing, was off Tai Yue Shan Island, Hong Kong,
when he spotted a coiled serpent in the water
with its head raised 2-3 feet in the air. It had a
crest on its head and two fins high on the neck.
He ordered Second Officer V. Kuster into a gig
with some sailors to try to kill it with a
boathook. However, the creature struck at one
of the oars, raised its head and neck 15 feet in
the air, then dived and disappeared. The men
estimated it was 40-50 feet long.
On December 30, 1947, the Grace Line
steamer Santa Clara was in the North Atlantic
118 miles east of Cape Lookout, North Car-
olina, when officers William Humphreys, John
Rigney, and John Axelson saw a snakelike head
rear out of the sea about 30 feet off the bow.
The body was about 3 feet thick and the head
about 5 feet long. The water around the animal
was stained red, and it seemed to be thrashing
about in agony.
John Ridgway and Chay Blyth saw a 3 5 -foot
sea animal around midnight on July 25, 1966,
during their journey across the North Atlantic
in the English Rose III rowboat. The creature
dived and passed underneath their boat, surfac-
ing on the other side.
On March 2, 1975, Carys Jones and five
other schoolgirls walking along the beach at
Llanaber, Gwynedd, Wales, saw a 10-foot ani-
mal with a long neck, long tail, and large, green
eyes walk into the water until it disappeared into
the sea. They ran to tell the coast guards, who
reported that the girls were extremely upset.
On February 5, 1985, Bill and Bob Clark
were watching sea lions near Stone Tower Point
in San Francisco Bay, California, when they
spotted a black, scaly, tubular creature with
three to five vertical coils chasing the animals
482 SEA MONSTERS
and churning up the water. It had a 30-foot
neck and a segmented body, black on top and
creamy-white below. It approached the shore
and was only 25 yards away from the witnesses,
who were able to see many details and estimate
its length at 60-100 feet. The Clark brothers
saw what was apparently the same animal seven
more times, the last time on March 1, 1987,
and obtained photos on two occasions.
Carcasses: An elongated, 55-foot Sea monster
washed up on Stronsay Island in the Orkneys,
Scotland, in late September 1808. It had a
bristly mane, three apparent pairs of legs, and a
small head on a longish neck. The skull, some
vertebrae, and one of the legs were examined by
John Barclay and Everard Home, who identi-
fied the carcass as a Basking shark ( Cetorhinus
maximus) — but not before Patrick Neill of the
Wernerian Natural History Society gave it the
scientific name Halsydrus pontopiddani as a new
species. Decomposing basking sharks do take on
a plesiosaur-like shape due to their enormous
gill slits, which practically encircle the head.
However, the length of the Stronsay carcass is
greater than the largest known basking shark
(50 feet); this has led Karl Shuker and Bernard
Heuvelmans to suggest that the animal was an
undescribed species of giant shark.
Other carcasses that probably involved bask-
ing sharks were found at Prah Sands, near Pen-
zance, Cornwall, England (June 7, 1928);
Querqueville, in Normandy, France (February
1934); Hendaye, Pyrenees-Atlantiques Depart-
ment, France (February 1951); and Skaket
Beach, on Cape Cod Bay, Massachusetts (De-
cember 1964).
In February 1899, a 60-foot monster that
washed up on Suwarrow Atoll in the Cook Is-
lands of the South Pacific was examined by the
crew of the English steamer Emu. Its head was 3
feet long, and two things like teeth were seen in
the lower jaw. The Australian Museum judged
it to be a Beaked whale (Family Ziphiidae) de-
composed beyond recognition.
A 20-foot carcass found at Jehu Sands, near
Mumbai, India, in April 1921 was probably a
Short-finned pilot whale ( Globicephala macro -
rhynchus).
Charles Moore discovered a Sea monster with
a porpoiselike head and a ducklike beak washed
up on the rocks at Natural Bridges State Beach
near Santa Cruz, California, in May 1925. Its
total length was about 35 feet. Two photo-
graphs of the carcass were widely distributed in
newspapers and magazines. Although the head
was undoubtedly that of a whale or porpoise,
the narrow, serpentine body and short tail did
not seem to correspond. Barton Warren Ever-
mann of the California Academy of Sciences vis-
ited the spot and obtained the skull, which
turned out to be that of a Baird’s beaked whale
( Berardius bairdii). Some artistic tampering
with the remains had apparently occurred for
the photographs.
Council Officer Charles Rankin observed a
stranded carcass at Gourock, Inverclyde, Scot-
land, in the summer of 1942. It was about 28
feet long, with a long neck, small head, large
and pointed teeth, large eyes, a rectangular tail,
and two pairs of flippers. There were many
bristly hairs in its smooth skin. The remains
were summarily buried. At face value, it sounds
like this animal was a basking shark, but these
sharks have small, hooked teeth.
The carcass of a 72-foot monster that washed
up on the beach near Tecolutla, Veracruz State,
Mexico, in March 1969 most likely belonged to
a Sei whale ( Balaenoptera borealis).
On April 25, 1977, the Japanese trawler
Zuiyo Maru dredged up a rotting corpse 30
miles east of Christchurch, New Zealand, that
the media portrayed as a plesiosaur. It was 32
feet long and weighed 4,000 pounds. After
being photographed, the carcass was dumped
overboard to avoid contaminating the ship’s
catch of fish. Eater, tissue analysis at Tokyo
University strongly indicated the animal was a
Basking shark ( Cetorhinus maximus) because of
the presence of elastoidin, a protein found in
sharks and rays. The apparent lack of a dorsal
fin was used as an argument for the carcass
being a plesiosaur, but one photo shows an ap-
parent dorsal fin displaced from the center of
the back.
A bleached, decomposing carcass 1 9 feet long
and 16 feet 6 inches wide washed up at St.
Bernard’s on Fortune Bay, Newfoundland, on
August 2, 2001 . The head and tail were missing.
SEA MONSTERS 483
The surface of the carcass was rough and fringed
with abraded tissue that resembled hair on ini-
tial inspection. A molecular analysis determined
that the carcass was that of a Sperm whale ( Phy -
seter catodon).
For other carcasses, see the CADDY and
Furred Sea Monster entries.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Oarfish or King of herrings
(. Regalecus glesne) is the longest of all bony
fishes, attaining a length of 36 feet (or
unverified lengths of up to 50 feet). Known
primarily from dead or dying specimens
found stranded or floating, this fish is pale
silver with blue streaks. It has a bright red
crest on its head that extends into an
elongated dorsal fin and two long, narrow
pelvic fins that resemble oars. It would be
biomechanically impossible for it to extend
its head above the water. It is found in
warmer waters in the Atlantic,
Mediterranean, and Pacific. On January 22,
1860, a 16 foot 6 inch oarfish was found
stranded on the rocks of Hungry Bay,
Bermuda, and misidentified as a Sea serpent
by Captain Hawtaigne of the Royal Navy.
(2) The Polka-dot ribbonfish ( Desmodema
polystictum) is a silvery, deep-sea fish with
bright red fins that grows to 3 feet 6 inches. It
is found in the Atlantic and western Pacific.
(3) The Basking shark ( Cetorhinus maximud)
can be mistaken for a plesiosaur-shaped Sea
monster when it is found stranded and
decomposed, as happened with the famous
Stronsay carcass of 1808. The gills and
lower jaw rot off early, leaving the small
skull. The decomposing fins leave behind
the ceratotrichia, which are tough, hairlike
fibers; the skin also deteriorates into wispy
filaments. The lower lobe of the tail drops
off before the upper one, which is
connected to the backbone. The claspers of
the male shark can appear to be legs. The
end result is a hairy, plesiosaur-like creature
with a small head on a long neck and a
narrow tail.
The basking shark’s longest official length is
32 feet, though unverified specimens up to
50 feet have been reported. Found in both
the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, especially
in certain favored coastal locations, the
basking shark will enter enclosed bays.
Normally harmless unless attacked, it swims
slowly at the surface in small groups,
feeding on copepods, fish eggs, and other
tiny animals. A 30-foot, mucus-covered Sea
monster reported by J. P. Jamieson and
others in the Shetland Islands in May and
October 1903 was probably a basking shark.
(4) The Whale shark ( Rhincodon typus) is
the largest fish in the world. It generally gets
no larger than 40 feet, but sizes up to 65
feet 6 inches have been confirmed. Weights
up to 22 tons have been recorded. It is
found in all warm seas, feeds on plankton,
and is very slow-moving and peaceable.
(5) The Giant manta ray ( Manta birostris)
has a broad head with a gaping mouth,
hornlike head fins, a wing width of up to 26
feet, and a short, whiplike tail. In the spring
and autumn, it leaps out of the water,
possibly as part of its mating behavior. It
was probably one of these rays that was seen
in the harbor at Darwin, Northern
Territory, Australia, in October 1959,
reportedly flying above the water at 80 miles
an hour.
(6) The European conger eel ( Conger conger)
grows to nearly 1 0 feet long and inhabits
the eastern Atlantic, the Mediterranean, and
the Black Sea.
(7) A snakelike Ribbon moray eel
( Rhinomuraena quaesita :), like the one that
Huguenot refugee Francois Le Guat caught
on the rocks of Mauritius in the 1690s.
(8) The Ocean sunfish (. Mola mold) has a
squat, cylinder-shaped body with long,
perpendicular dorsal and anal fins. Instead
of scales, it has thick, elastic skin. Its
maximum length is about 10 feet 10 inches,
and it is found in warm and temperate
zones in all the oceans. It often drifts at the
surface while lying on its side or swims
upright with only its dorsal fin showing
above water. What biologist P. G. Corbin
called his “private sea-monster” — a creature
he observed in the North Atlantic while
working on the Royal Oceanographic vessel
484 SEA MONSTERS

Discovery in the early 1950s — was probably
a large sunfish.
(9) A dead or dying Giant squid
C Architeuthis ) when found floating or
washed up on the shore might be mistaken
for a Sea monster. Its soft, limp, and slimy
mantle could appear to be a snake’s cast-off
skin or a mane. Henry Lee (in 1883) and
Richard Ellis (in 1994) have argued that
many, if not most, Sea monster sightings
can be attributed to various views of
Architeuthis tentacles, arms, and mantles.
On July 8, 1875, off Cabo de Sao Roque,
Brazil, the crew and officers of the merchant
bark Pauline witnessed a struggle between a
Sperm whale ( Physeter catodon ) and what
seemed to be a huge serpent apparently
coiled around it. The serpent was most
likely the arms and tentacles of a squid.
(10) There are about 900 species of marine
Ribbon worms (Phylum Nemertea), but the
largest is the dark-brown European
nemertine ( Lineus longissimus) , which
commonly reaches lengths of 16-33 feet. It
has been known to attain 100 feet, but at
that length, it would be less than half an
inch thick. The creature that some
fishermen of Usan, south of Montrose,
Angus, Scotland, took to a local museum in
1 849 was probably a 20-foot specimen of
one of these worms.
(11) Extensive colonies of Sea squirts or
Tunicates (Subphylum Urochordata) have
been suggested by Roy P. Mackal for some
unusual Sea monster sightings. These
animals form extended tubes that float at
the surface and can reach a length of 33
feet. Each individual in the colony filters
nutrients from the surrounding water and
squirts out the excess water, resulting in
what might seem like an undulating
movement. Tunicates in the genus Pyrosoma
have organs that contain luminescent
bacteria that add an eerie glow to the
SEA MONSTERS 485
configuration; those in the Class Salpida
have a translucent tunic that is sometimes
brightly colored.
(12) When traveling slowly, Porpoises
(Family Phocoenidae) surface to breathe
with a smooth, forward motion. Killer
whales ( Orcinus orca ) make slow, shallow
leaps out of the water when swimming fast.
Several individuals swimming in line could
conceivably be mistaken for the multiple
coils of a Sea monster. Killer whale carcasses
were mistaken for Sea monsters in Alaska in
1946 and in Malaysia in 1996.
(13) A whale might be mistaken for a Sea
monster if it appears unexpectedly.
However, whales do not have the long necks
often reported on Sea monsters. Breaching,
blowing, fluking, and diving behaviors are
recognizable even to untrained observers.
Rorqual whales (Family Balaenopteridae)
include the Blue whale ( Balaenoptera
musculus ), one of the largest animals ever to
have lived; it generally reaches a length of
78-88 feet, with outsize individuals known
to attain 110 feet. Some rorquals are
inquisitive and will circle or accompany
boats. The square head of the Sperm whale
(Physeter catodon) is unmistakable at close
range; these animals are generally 40-60
feet long. A Northern right whale
( Eubalaena glacialis ) was apparently the
stimulus for a sighting off Gloucester,
Massachusetts, on April 29, 1975, by the
crew of the fishing vessel Debbie Rose.
(14) The Southern elephant seal (Mirounga
leonina ) has been suggested by anatomist
Richard Owen as the explanation for the
Daedalus sighting of 1848. Although it is
the largest seal in the world, the male
typically averages only 14-16 feet long; the
record length is the 22-foot specimen taken
off South Georgia Island in 1913, which
scarcely comes close to the 60-foot length
Capt. Peter M’Quhae observed carefully.
(15) The Hooded seal ( Cystophora cristata)
attains a length of nearly 1 0 feet. A solitary
mammal of the North Atlantic, it often
wanders far from its normal breeding and
foraging ranges to turn up in unexpected
locales, such as up the St. Lawrence River as
far as Montreal or as far south as the coasts
of Florida, southern California, or Portugal.
(16) Sea snakes (Family Hydrophiidae) are
completely aquatic, tropical snakes of
Australasia and Southeast Asia with paddle-
shaped tails that aid in locomotion. Most
are only 2-5 feet long; the longest are the
Yellow sea snake ( Hydrophis spiralis ), which
grows to 8 feet, and the Stoke’ s sea snake
( Astrotia stoke sii ) , which reaches 6 feet.
However, they can be found in large
aggregations in calm waters. In the 1930s,
Willoughby Lowe observed a solid mass of
sea snakes twisted together in the Strait of
Malacca; he claimed the mass was 1 0 feet
wide and perhaps 60 miles long.
(17) Pythons (Family Boidae) are good
freshwater swimmers. They have been
found short distances from the coast, but
they cannot drink saltwater and probably
would not fare well in rough seas. The
animal that Third Officer S. Clayton of the
Taiyuan saw swimming in the Celebes Sea
in the summer of 1907 may have been a
very large python, although he put its
length at 70 feet, more than twice the
length of the largest Reticulated python
(. Python reticulata).
(18) Hoaxes do exist. Newspapers in the
nineteenth century were unashamed about
making up humorous Sea serpent stories;
dubious letters to the editor were also
published, such as the facetious account of
the steamer Don s August 1881 encounter
with a monster that Le Monde Illustre ran,
accompanied by a wildly fanciful
illustration. The color photo of a 70-foot
Sea serpent taken by Robert Le Serrec off
Hook Island, Queensland, Australia, on
December 12, 1964, has not held up under
scrutiny and apparently shows a huge mass
of plastic or cloth shaped to look like a
monster; Le Serrec’s narrative was also
problematic, and there is some evidence of a
premeditated financial scam.
(19) Floating seaweed or dead trees might
be misidentified from a distance. Some
Brown seaweeds (Phaeophyta) form strands
486 SEA MONSTERS
1,000 feet in length or longer. On
December 28, 1848, the ship Pekin was
becalmed in the South Atlantic when Capt.
Frederic Smith and the crew spied what
looked like a long-necked, maned Sea
monster; when a ship’s boat drew alongside,
however, they realized it was a 20-foot
clump of seaweed. In the 1850s, surgeon
Arthur Adams was on a ship in Bo Hai
Gulf, China, when the crew thought they
saw a 12-foot snake swimming against the
tide; unfortunately, it turned out to be a
gnarled tree root caught in a fishnet.
(20) A flock of birds skimming the water
for fish can look serpentine from a distance,
at least temporarily.
(21) Other animals that could pose as Sea
monsters include the Lion’s mane jelly
( Cyanea capillata ), Deal fish ( Trachipterus
arcticus) , Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar ),
Giant grouper ( Epinephelus lance o latus ) ,
Swordfish {Xiphias gladius) , Atlantic halibut
( Hippoglossus hippoglossus ), Atlantic sturgeon
( Acipenser oxyrhynchus) , Saltwater crocodile
0 Crocodylus porosus ), Leatherback turtle
(. Dermochelys coriacea ), Komodo dragon
( Varanus komodoensis ), Anaconda ( Eunectes
murinus ), and a swimming Asian elephant
(. Elephas maximus).
(22) A surviving plesiosaur, a member of a
group of marine reptiles that swam with
paddlelike limbs, has long been a popular
Sea monster candidate. Some species had
long necks, and body length varied from 6
to 46 feet. The eyes tended to point
upward, and the neck had limited vertical
movement, making the head-and-neck
posture of many Sea monsters and
Freshwater Monsters unlikely. Plesiosaur
fossils are found continuously from the
Middle Triassic to the end of the
Cretaceous, 238-65 million years ago,
though there was a smaller extinction at the
end of the Jurassic, 144 million years ago,
that resulted in a reduction in diversity. The
animals swam either like sea lions, using a
downward and backward stroke; or like sea
turtles, using a figure-eight stroke that
generated lift as well as forward motion.
The long-necked forms were probably
slower swimmers that ambushed fishes from
below. Fossils have been found from every
continent, including Antarctica. The first
person to suggest that the Sea serpent might
be a plesiosaur was apparently Yale
University geologist Benjamin Silliman, in
1833.
(23) A surviving basilosaurid whale, a
member of a family of archaic whales that
lived 42-33 million years ago in the Middle
to Late Eocene, is another frequent
contender for Sea monster identity. These
animals were torpedo-shaped and had
flexible and elongated vertebrae, huge skulls
more than 3 feet long, curved front teeth,
serrated cheek teeth, flexible necks, twin
flippers derived from forelegs, small dorsal
fins, and long, fluked tails. The hind limbs,
about 2 feet long in Basilosaurus isis, were
reduced but functional. Nostrils were
located at the top of the snout. Unlike
modern whales, the teeth were differentiated
into incisors, canines, and molars.
Basilosaurids came in a wide range of sizes,
from 6 to 82 feet long. They are known to
have inhabited shallow coastal waters and
swamps as well as open oceans. Fossils have
been found in Egypt (especially in
Zeuglodon Valley), India, and North
America. The first person to suggest that the
Sea serpent might be a basilosaurid was
apparently the German botanist Matthias
Jakob Schleiden, in 1847.
(24) An enormous marine salamander of
some type, suggested by Malcolm Burr.
(25) Bernard Heuvelmans and others have
had to postulate animals not known from
the fossil record to account for many Sea
monster characteristics. See the specific
types listed earlier in this entry.

SEALS (Unknown)
Seals, sea lions, and walruses constitute the liv-
ing Suborder Pinnipedia. Whether this is a sub-
group of Carnivora or a full order on its own has
long been the subject of debate, but recent mo-
lecular evidence indicates that all three groups
emerged from bearlike carnivore ancestors in
the Oligocene, 33-24 million years ago. All pin-
nipeds have four webbed limbs modified for use
as flippers, torpedo-shaped bodies adapted for
life and locomotion in the water, round heads
tapering smoothly into the trunk, large canine
teeth, and enlarged eyes modified for finding
food under water in low-light conditions. They
are swift swimmers and deep divers: The Cali-
fornia sea lion (Zalophus calif ornianus) can reach
a speed of 25 miles an hour, and the Weddell
seal ( Leptonychotes weddellii ) regularly reaches
depths of 900-1,000 feet. Seals are not com-
pletely aquatic like the SlRENIANS because to
breed and rear young, they must go on land,
where they cannot move about as efficiently.
The three extant families of pinnipeds are the
True seals (Lamily Phocidae), the Sea lions and
Fur seals (Family Otariidae), and the Walrus
(Family Odobenidae). True seals lack earflaps,
and they move sinuously through the water like
a fish, using their flippers only for steering; on
land, they hunch like caterpillars or wriggle
from side to side. Sea lions and fur seals have ex-
ternal earflaps, and they use their front flippers
as underwater wings, allowing the hinder parts
to follow passively; on land, they walk on their
front flippers and either rotate their hind flip-
pers forward to serve as hind feet or drag them
passively. The walrus is intermediate; it has no
earflaps, swims and walks on land like a sea lion,
and has upper canines modified into highly spe-
cialized tusks. The different methods of loco-
motion are important to assess the argument
that certain types of Sea MONSTERS are pin-
nipeds adapted to a purely aquatic existence.
The largest seal is the Southern elephant seal
( Mirounga leonind). Adult bulls average 14-16
feet long, with outsize individuals growing to
more than 21 feet.
Although seals primarily live in oceanic habi-
tats, some have no difficulty traveling into fresh-
water in search of fish. The Baikal seal ( Phoca
sibirica ) and the Caspian seal ( Phoca caspicd)
have become completely isolated in freshwater
lakes.
As cryptids, seals can pose as both FRESHWA-
TER and Sea MONSTERS, and they have played
an important role in the lore of MERBEINGS. Of
the four listed here, one is a possible survival of
a recently extinct species and the others could
represent completely new species.

Sehite
Small Hominid of West Africa.
Etymology: Guere (Kru) word.
Variant names: Niankonkla, Seite.
Physical description: Long, reddish fur. Long,
red head-hair. Large head. Said to be “lumi-
nous” (brightly colored?).
Behavior: Nocturnal. Upright gait but also
climbs trees. Said to have bartered for goods
with local tribes until 1935.
Habitat: Rain forest.
Distribution: From Seguela to Abidjan, in
Cote d’Ivoire.
Significant sightings: A red-furred “pygmy”
was seen in the forest near Adiopo-Doume,
Cote d’Ivoire, in January 1947 by an African lab
assistant working for zoologist Andre Ledoux.
In the same year, a small, reddish primate was
killed by the elephant hunter Dunckel in the
forest between Guiglo and Toulepleu.
Possible explanations:
(1) An undiscovered population of short-
statured forest-forager people related to the
Mbenga Pygmies of Gabon and Cameroon.
(2) The Western red colobus monkey
( Piliocolobus badius) has bright-red to light-
orange underparts and a body length of 2
feet (plus a 2 foot 6 inch tail). However, it
is primarily arboreal and lacks thumbs,
which prevents it from grasping objects.

Scotland; Ireland; the Faroe Islands; to a lesser
extent, Iceland and Norway.
Possible explanations:
(1) The survival of a pre-Christian taboo on
harming the seal, a sacred or totem animal
to the Celts.
(2) Some sightings may be based on the
similarity of seals, especially the Gray seal
(Halichoerus grypus), to human beings, at
least from a distance.
(3) Some sightings may be based on
occasional visits to Scotland by sealskin-
clad, kayaking, nomadic Saami from
northern Norway. This might well explain
folklore about the creatures’ upright
appearance in the water, becoming human
when they remove their skins, and liaisons
with the locals.

Selma
Freshwater Monster of Norway.
Etymology: Coined by Jan-Ove Sundberg.
Variant name: Seljora.
Physical description: Length, 13-160 feet.
Black. Head like a horse’s or crocodile’s. Long,
thin neck. Mane sometimes reported. A pair of
front flippers. One to five humps.
Behavior: Turns its head from side to side.
Swims swiftly. Makes a snorting or growling
sound under water.
Tracks: Leaves a furrow in the snow 15 inches
wide and 12 inches deep when it ventures on
land.
Distribution: Seljordsvatnet, Telemark
County, Norway.
Significant sightings: Gunleik Andersson-
Verpe’s rowboat was overturned in 1750 by a
sea horse.
About 1880, Bjorn Bjorge and his mother,
Gunhild, encountered a 3-foot lizard that they
believed was a juvenile lake monster. It swam
toward them as they were washing clothes, and
Gunhild swatted it with a stick, killing it. Part
of it stayed on the beach for months because no
one dared come near it.
Around 1920, Eivind Fjodstuft was fishing at
Sinnesodden Point when he saw a crocodile-like
animal emerge from the lake and climb a cliff
face. It jumped back in when he approached.
SELMA 491
On the west side of the lake at Svarvaren in
May 1963, Torje Lindstol watched an animal
with a deerlike head and long neck about 150 feet
off the shore. After about ten seconds, it sank into
the water, showing a portion of its back.
In August 1963, Walther Berg saw a 30-foot
animal resting on the surface of the lake.
In September 1969, divers Arne and Alf
Thomassen conducted a search for Selma and
found some odd grooves on the lake bottom, as
if something heavy had been moving there.
On July 5, 1977, Jan-Ove Sundberg obtained
a strong underwater signal with a Simrad EL-38
echo sounder. Twice, the sonar indicated a large
target that approached his boat swiftly at a
depth of 60 feet and halted only 30 feet away.
Two days later, the sonar picked up three huge
objects moving underwater on parallel courses.
On July 6, 1978, Sundberg took some dim
Super 8-millimeter footage of an animal that
was swimming toward the shore at Sinnesodden
in the twilight.
Kari Aakre and her family were driving west
along the lake to Seljord in July 1995 when they
saw three animals churning up the water in the
lake. One was only 150 feet from shore, while
the two others were about 600 feet away. Other
drivers stopped along the road to watch as well.
All three animals submerged instantly when the
tourboat Fjoellguten //came into view and blew
its whistle.
In 1998 and 2000, Sundberg recorded pecu-
liar sounds in the lake using sophisticated, un-
derwater hydrophones. He described the noise
as “a cross between a snorting horse and an eat-
ing pig.” His GUST 2000 expedition also ob-
tained an echo sounder sonar recording that in-
dicated two 60-foot animals were swimming a
few yards above the lake bottom.
On August 8, 2000, Erik Knatterud glimpsed
what seemed to be a reddish-brown head in the
middle of the lake. It submerged before he
could photograph it.

Seme
Small Hominid of West Africa.
Etymology: Fang (Bantu) word.
Physical description: Height, 2-3 feet. Dark
red or yellow. Long head-hair down to its waist.
No tail.
Behavior: Said to herd wild forest hogs.
Tracks: Found with wild boar tracks.
Distribution: Northern Gabon.
Possible explanation: An undiscovered popula-
tion of short-statured, forest-forager people re-
lated to the Mbenga Pygmies of Gabon and
Cameroon, with some possible confusion with
Red colobus monkeys (Piliocolobus spp.).

SEMIMYTHICAL BEASTS
The creatures in this section have two things in
common: each has been known since ancient
times, and each could originally be based on one
or more real animals (or their fossil remains).
This group is often cited as evidence for the cre-
ativity of the human mind in constructing large,
scary, purely imaginary monsters — either to ex-
plain how the world works or because there is a
“universal need” to be scared based on a primal
fear of the predators that our arboreal ancestors
faced. That may be true in some instances, but
a more sensible explanation might be that some
kind of observation (or misidentification) in na-
ture takes place first, after which speculative
writers and theorizers add one layer of legend
and symbolism after another over hundreds of
years until only the myth exists and the animals
492 SEME
are forgotten. That certainly seems to have been
the case with the GRIFFIN, whereby fossil DI-
NOSAUR skeletons seen in the Gobi Desert made
their way over time into European architecture
and heraldry.
One source of much animal lore and misin-
formation was the medieval bestiary, a popular
compilation of zoological data that was
reprinted nearly as often as the Bible and revised
constantly. Many of the literary creatures found
in the bestiaries are technically cryptids, since
no living animals have been found to corre-
spond to the myths. By separating fact from fan-
tasy, cryptozoologists can shed light both on the
history of science and the anthropology of myth
and symbolism.

Senegal Dolphin
Unknown CETACEAN of West Africa.
Physical description: Length, 6 feet. Brown
above, distinctly white below. Similar to the
pantropical spotted dolphin but lacking its
characteristic spots.
Significant sighting: Seen in great numbers off
the coast of Senegal by Willem Morzer Bruyns.
Possible explanations: Significant variations in
the markings of the Pantropical spotted dolphin
(Stenella attenuatd) are known to occur both in-
dividually and geographically. Confusion also
occurs with the Bottlenose dolphin ( Tursiops
truncatus ), the Atlantic hump-backed dolphin
( Sousa teuszii ), and the Atlantic spotted dolphin
(Stenella frontalis ), which may also have spot-
ting.

Senegal Stone Partridge
Undescribed Bird of West Africa.
Physical description: Chickenlike. Spotted
head. Pale breast. Length, less than 10 inches.
Habitat: Forests and dense undergrowth.
Distribution: Senegal.
Possible explanation: Unknown subspecies of
Stone partridge ( Ptilopachus petrosus) distin-
guished from the nominate species by its small
size and preference for a forest habitat, rather
than rocky gorges.

Set
HYENA-like animal of North Africa.
Etymology : Transliterated sts, from the Egyp-
tian hieroglyphs. Set may have given rise to the
Hebrew satan (“adversary”), the original deriva-
tion of the word Satan.
Variant names: Seth, Sutekh, Typhon (Greek).
Physical description: Doglike quadruped.
Larger than a jackal. Reddish-brown color.
Black face. Long, erect, squared-off ears.
Curved, elongated snout. Forked, upraised tail.
Behavior: Nocturnal. Powerful and dangerous.
Hunts in packs. Makes a loud noise. Has a foul
odor. Eats meat and carrion. Spews rabid saliva.
Habitat: Desert or wasteland.
Distribution: Southern Egypt.
Significant sighting: Set was originally a
zoomorphic local god of Upper Egypt, possibly
established as early as the predynastic Nagada
culture. After the arrival of the Osirian religion
in the Fifth dynasty (2498-2345 B.C.), Set be-
came the epitome of chaos as the god of dark-
ness, war, and the wilderness. The god Set was
widely despised, so his animal may have been
one that was hunted down and eradicated.
Possible explanations:
(1) Egyptologists have proposed a Nile
crocodile ( Crocodylus niloticus) , a
Hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius), a
Snake (Order Squamata), an Ass (Equus
asinus ), an Onager (Equus hemionis onager ),
a Camel (Camelus spp.), a Fennec fox
(Fennecus zerda ), a Desert jerboa (Jaculus
jaculus) , a Hare (Lepus spp.), a mouse with a
long snout (Subfamily Murinae), a
SET 493
Set, a zoomorphic god of ancient Egypt, possibly based on
an unknown hyena-like animal. (© 2002 ArtToday.com,
Inc., an IMSI Company)
Domestic pig ( Sus scrofa var. domestica ), a
European wild boar ( Sus scrofa ), an Oryx
{Oryx spp.), a Giraffe {Giraffa
Camelopardalis ), a Gazelle {Gazella spp.), an
Aurochs {Bos primigenius) , a Striped hyena
{Hyaena hyaena), an Aardvark {Orycteropus
afer ), an Elephantfish (Family Mormyridae),
an Okapi {Okapia johnstoni), and various
dogs and birds. Few of these animals come
close to matching Set’s description and
behavior.
(2) The Golden jackal {Canis aureus) has a
characteristic and high-pitched howl, is
nocturnal and omnivorous, and may hunt
socially. But the Egyptians had other jackal
deities (such as Anubis) and did not regard
the golden jackal as particularly unpleasant.
(3) The African wild dog {Lycaon p ictus) has
a musky odor, a black face, and hunts in
packs. Its ears are prominent, and its tufted
tail is semierect. It is active in the day and
has a distinctive, marbled pelt.
(4) A wild predecessor of the greyhound,
thought to have originated in the Middle
East. A greyhoundlike breed called the tesem
was depicted on Egyptian tombs as far back
as 3000 B.C. Saharan rock art also shows
prick-eared hunting dogs with long tails.
The Shilluk dog, bred by the Shilluk and
Dinka Nilotic peoples, is similarly
descended from the tesem and shares some
Set characteristics. The long ears and snout
and the erect tail may have been bred out as
undesirable features long ago.
(5) A surviving fossil hyaenid, such as
Chasmaporthetes nitidula from the
Pleistocene of Morocco, with teeth suitable
for slicing meat, suggested by Michael
Swords.
(6) Herbert Wendt suggested that the head
of Set was based on fossil skulls of
Libytherium, an extinct, short-necked
giraffid. Its substantial horns may have been
interpreted as erect ears. Large fossil bones
have been found in at least two Egyptian
shrines to Set, where worshipers apparently
donated them.
(7) An amalgam of the characteristics of
various animals.

Shag Dog
BLACK Dog of central England.
Etymology: Probably from its shaggy coat.
494 SHAG DOG
Variant name: Shag foal.
Physical description: Large, black, mastifflike
dog. Glowing eyes. Luminous breath.
Behavior: Lives in a pit.
Distribution: Leicestershire and Lincolnshire.
Significant sighting: In 1 806, a man was walk-
ing by Scholar’s Bridge near Sapcote, Leicester-
shire, when a “shagged dog” flew by him and
brushed his right shoulder.

Etymology: Arabic (Semitic) equivalent of
Satan , the evildoer; the name can refer to any
evil spirit or creature. See Dev, FARISHTA.
Distribution: Islamic areas.

Shamanu
Mystery Dog of Japan.
Scientific name: Canis lupus hodophilax, given
by C. J. Temminck in 1839.
Variant names: Hondo wolf, Honshu wolf,
Japanese wolf, Nihon okami.
Physical description: Like the gray wolf but
smaller. Length, 2 feet 9 inches. Ash-gray or
beige color. Short ears. Shoulder height, 14
inches. Short legs. Black tail tip.
Distribution: Nara Prefecture and the
Chichibu-Tama National Park in Saitama Pre-
fecture, Honshu, Japan.
Significant sightings: On October 14, 1996,
Hiroshi Yagi took nineteen photographs of a
specimen at close range in the Chichibu District.
High school principal Satoshi Nishida snapped
ten photos of a female wolf on July 8, 1997, in
central Kyushu.
Present status: The Japanese wolf was the
smallest known wolf. It disappeared as Japan’s
deer population, its traditional prey, dwindled
in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, per-
haps aided by an epidemic of canine distemper.
The last confirmed specimen of Japanese wolf
was killed near Washikaguchi, Nara Prefecture,
in January 1905. In 1970, a Dr. Yoshinori
classed it as a distinct species, but this identifi-
cation has not been accepted.
Possible explanations:
(1) Feral Domestic dogs ( Canis familiaris).
(2) Descendants of pre-1905 Japanese wolf
( Canis lupus hodophilax) x domestic dog
hybrids. The wolf probably figured in the
creation of such Japanese breeds as the
shikoku, kai, and the shiba inu.

Shan Gui
Giant Hominid of East Asia.
Etymology: Mandarin Chinese (Sino-
Tibetan), “mountain monster.”
Variant names: Shan da-ren (“big man of the
mountain”), Shan tu (in Vietnam).
Distribution: Southern China; northern Viet-
nam.
Significant sightings: The poet Qu Yuan
(340-278 B.C.) wrote a poem about the Shan
gui.

Sharlie
Freshwater Monster of Idaho.
Etymology: The name was chosen by local res-
idents in 1954.
Variant names: McCall serpent, Slimy Slim.
SHARLIE 495
Physical description: Length, 20-40 feet. Black
to dark green. Smooth skin, sometimes de-
scribed as shell-like or rubbery. Head like a
camel’s. Ears like a bulldog’s. Blunt snout. Long
neck. Three to four dorsal humps, the middle
one being the largest. Large, fiat, finned tail.
Behavior: Swims with vertical undulations.
Distribution: Payette Lake, Idaho.
Significant sightings: In July 1944, Thomas
Rogers and others saw a 3 5 -foot-long animal
with a head like that of a “snub-nosed croco-
dile” undulating through the water.
In 1952, Pauline Miller watched a bulky,
three-humped animal with a finned tail floating
in the McCall city dock. It had a distinct, scaly,
shell-like covering on the top.
On June 12, 1977, Cathleen B. Millburn and
Doug Crowther were fishing in a boat off
Cougar Bay when they noticed a disturbance in
the water and saw three swiftly moving humps.
Possible explanations:
(1) The White sturgeon ( Acipenser
transmontanus) is the largest freshwater fish
in North America, growing to 20 feet long.
However, there have been no reports of a
dorsal fin, and sturgeon are not known in
Payette Lake.
(2) The Northern elephant seal (. Mirounga
angustirostris) matches the size, but
unfortunately, this is a marine mammal.

Shiashia-Yawa
Medium-sized mystery Cat of South America.
Etymology: Shuar (Jivaroan) word.
Physical description: Length, 4 feet 5 inches.
Smaller than a jaguar and larger than an ocelot.
White background color. Tightly packed, solid-
black spots.
Distribution: Ecuador.

Shing Mun Tiger
Unknown big Cat of East Asia.
Etymology: From the name of the valley where
it raided.
Physical description: Variously described as a
tiger or leopard but dark gray. Length, 4 feet.
Glowing eyes. Long tail.
Distribution: Hong Kong, China.
Significant sightings: In July 1965, schoolgirls
picnicking on the slopes of Tai Mo Shan north
of Kowloon, Hong Kong, spotted a tiger skulk-
ing in the nearby underbrush. A few other sight-
ings occurred in the Shing Mun Valley over the
following three months, but search parties failed
to turn up any solid evidence. A local man
named Chan Pui claimed to have captured the
fearsome creature, but the animal turned out to
be a friendly German shepherd x chow cross-
breed — obviously nothing like a tiger.
Another blackish-gray mystery cat turned up
near Sai Kung, northeast of Kowloon, in late
October 1976.
Possible explanations: Neither Leopards ( Pan-
thera pardus) nor Tigers (P. tigris) are currently
known in Hong Kong.

Shompallhue
MERBEING of South America.
Etymology: Araucanian, “lord of the waters.”
Variant names: Konilafquen, Kurupillan,
Nguenko.
Physical description: Small, egglike head. No
neck.
Behavior: Sometimes said to kidnap children.
Distribution: Chile; South Pacific Ocean.
Significant sighting: On January 3, 1957, a
sailor was on watch on Eric de Bisschop’s raft,
Tahiti-Nui, in the South Pacific when he heard
something jump on board. He found a creature
standing on its tail on the raft. It had seaweed
on its hair. When the sailor touched it, it
jumped into the ocean, leaving loose fish scales
on his arm.

Shorter Hominid
This term is used by Mark A. Hall to distinguish
the shorter GlANT HOMINID from the Neo-
Giant (Bigfoot), the Taller Hominid, the
True Giant, and the Homo erectus Least Ho-
minid. He includes in this category the Nakani
and Gul.
Variant name: Neanderthaloid hominid.
Physical description: Average height, 5 feet tall.
Tracks: Length, 7-15 inches. Width, 4-8
inches. Big toe angles outward. Toes approxi-
mately the same size and separated from each
other.
Distribution: West and Central Asia; North
America.
Possible explanation: Hall identifies this cate-
gory as surviving Neanderthals ( Homo nean-
derthalensih , a group of hominids that flour-
ished in Europe and West Asia until about
50,000-35,000 years ago. According to recent
DNA studies, they are not directly ancestral to
modern humans; however, since the two types
coexisted at some point, there may have been
cultural and genetic exchanges. European male
Neanderthals averaged 5 feet 6 inches tall; fe-
males averaged 5 feet 3 inches. Neanderthals
had heavy, arching browridges; sloping fore-
heads; broad, flat noses; protruding faces; robust
bodies with well-developed muscles; and rela-
tively long thighs and upper arms. Like earlier
hominids, they walked upright. Neanderthal
fossils are found from Wales south to Gibraltar
and east through the Middle East to Uzbek-
istan; none have been discovered in the Ameri-
cas or Africa.

Shunka Warak’in
Unknown HYENA-like animal of North
America.
Etymology: Iowa-Oto (Siouan), “carrying-off
dogs.”
Variant name: Ringdocus.
Physical description: Black hair. High shoul-
ders. Sloping back.
Behavior: Steals Native Americans’ dogs.
Cries like a human when killed.
Distribution: Montana; Nebraska; Iowa; Al-
berta, Canada.
Significant sightings: Sometime in the 1880s,
Ross Hutchins’s grandfather shot and killed a
hyena-like animal on his ranch in the Madison
River valley north of Ennis, Montana. He gave
it to a man named Sherwood, who exhibited it
for many years at his grocery store near Henrys
Lake, Idaho, as a “Ringdocus.”
In July 1991, a hyena-like animal was seen by
several people close to the Alberta Wildlife Park
near Legal, Alberta. It was heavy in front and
low in the rear and was seen pacing back and
forth.
Present status: The mounted Ringdocus may
SHUNKA WARAK’IN 497
still exist somewhere, according to Loren
Coleman.
Possible explanations:
(1) A surviving Bear-dog (Family
Amphicyonidae), a group of predators that
lived in North America about 34-5 million
years ago, from the Late Eocene through the
Miocene. Bear-dogs had wolflike faces and
medium-to-large bodies with massive thigh
and shoulder bones. Most had plantigrade
feet, but some were digitigrade. Some
species could climb trees like bears, whereas
others were adapted for running.
(2) A surviving Chasmaporthetes ossifragus,
the only fossil hyaenid found in North
America. It was a mobile hunter that lived 2
million-10,000 years ago, from the Pliocene
to the Pleistocene.
(3) A surviving borophagine dog, a member
of a diverse group that once filled the same
ecological niche in North America as hyenas
did in Africa. Ranging from the size of a fox
to the size of a lion, they had powerful jaw
muscles, broad and strong heads, and short
muzzles. They were replaced by extinct
forms of modern canines sometime in the
Pliocene, 4—2 million years ago.

Shuswaggi
Freshwater Monster of British Columbia,
Canada.
Etymology: After Shuswap Lake.
Variant names: Shoosy, Sicopogo, Ta-zam-a
(Shuswap/Salishan, “water bear”), Ta-zum-a.
Physical description: Like a gigantic eel.
Length, 20-30 feet. Glossy black. Seven humps.
Behavior: Swims at 10 miles per hour. Churns
the water fiercely.
Distribution: Shuswap Lake, British Columbia.
Significant sightings: A Shuswap Indian from
Squilax is said to have killed a Ta-zam-a in 1904
and sold the skin in Enderby for $60. The ani-
mal was as large as a grizzly bear and had hair 4
inches long. Its feet were 12 inches long and
looked like a mole’s.
On July 12, 1948, a huge animal surfaced
near the boat of C. Dew and nearly upset it. On
July 27, D. Sinclair saw what seemed to be one
of his black steers in the water. When he ap-
proached, it dived swiftly and disappeared.
Richard Medley saw a brown hump off the
southern shore of the lake in August 1962.
On June 3, 1984, Linda Griffiths and her
children saw a 25-foot, serpentine animal with
seven humps churning up the water.

SiemePs Mystery Cat
Unknown Cat of South America.
Physical description: Heavily built. Fawn coat
with brown spots. Dark stripe along the spine.
Distribution: Mato Grosso State, Brazil.
Significant sighting: Adventurer Sasha Siemel
shot a cat of this description in the 1930s or
1940s.
Present status: Only one known specimen, not
preserved.
Possible explanation: A Puma ( Puma concolor)
x Jaguar ( Panthera onca ) intergeneric hybrid,
proposed by Siemel. However, most inter-
generic hybrids are bred in captivity and are not
found in the wild.

Silwane Manzi
DlNOSAUR-like animal of South Africa.
Etymology: From the Tsonga (Bantu) s’l-
waaane manzi (“unpleasant aquatic animal”).
Usually means “crocodile,” unless the context
indicates otherwise.
Physical description: Elongated. Scaly. Head is
like a turtle’s. Small, green eyes. Two sharp ears
or horns.
Behavior: Nocturnal. Amphibious. Bipedal.
Snorts. Eats fishes.
Tracks: Clawed, three-toed prints inter-
spersed with smaller prints, apparently the
forefeet, and straight marks, possibly the tail.
Length, 16 inches from middle claw tip to heel.
Width, 13 inches. Distance between toes, 6-9
inches. Stride, 4 feet.
Habitat: Brackish or saltwater estuaries.
Distribution: Estuary of the Mfolozi River,
KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa.
Significant sighting: In 1937, Aleko Lilius
twice glimpsed a scaly creature that made an ex-
tensive set of three-toed tracks before it ran off
into the ocean.
Present status: Only reported once.
Possible explanations:
(1) Lilius later caught a local witch doctor
making similar tracks with a wooden
instrument.
(2) Surviving hadrosaur or duck-billed
dinosaur, extinct since the Cretaceous
period, suggested by Ivan Sanderson.
However, hadrosaur fossils have not been
found in Africa. At one time, these animals
were considered to be amphibious, but their
stiff tails, short toes, and small hands are
now considered evidence that they were
primarily terrestrial.

Siren
Lemale MERBEING of Southern Europe.
Etymology: From the Greek seiren, uncertain
origin.
Variant names: Drac (in medieval Provence),
Sirene (French), Syren.
Physical description: In early Greek art, por-
trayed as a composite creature with the head and
bust of a woman and the body and claws of a
bird. Homer’s Odyssey (ninth century? B.C.)
doesn’t mention the Siren’s form. Beginning in
the Age of Alexander (300 B.C.), it began to lose
its bird shape, and by the Middle Ages, it was
described as having a fish’s tail. By the end of
the twelfth century, the Siren was considered
synonymous with the MERMAID.
Behavior: Magical voice. Seductive. Lures
sailors to death by its sweet singing. Presages a
storm.
Distribution: Greece and southern Italy, espe-
cially Sicily and Capri.
Possible explanation: The sixteenth-century
Italian naturalist Ulisse Androvandi thought
that Homer’s Siren was the Nightingale ( Lusce -
nia megarhynchos ), widely considered in antiq-
uity to have the most melodious song of any Eu-
ropean bird; the song consists of liquid and
vibrating trills, a rapid sequence of “chook”
notes, a slow “piu piu,” and a final crescendo.
Perhaps some sailors hearing the melody ven-
tured too close to the rocky shore and perished.

500 SINT-HOLO
SIRENIANS (Unknown)
The Order Sirenia encompasses a group of her-
bivorous mammals completely adapted to an
aquatic life. There are four living species — three
Manatees (Family Trichechidae) and one
Dugong (Family Dugongidae). The Amazon
manatee ( Trie hec bus inunguis) is exclusively a
freshwater animal, while the others inhabit both
salt- and freshwater. A fifth species called the
Steller’s Sea Cow, the largest sirenian that
ever lived, was apparently exterminated in the
late eighteenth century. All sirenians have one
pair of large front flippers, thick bones to help
them stay submerged, no external hind limbs,
axillary mammary glands at the base of each
flipper, and powerful tails for propulsion. Their
peaceful disposition, slow movement, and poor
hearing make them especially vulnerable to
human exploitation.
The first sirenians appeared in the Early
Eocene, about 52 million years ago, in Eurasian
seas and quickly spread to other tropical areas.
The earliest known fossil ( Prorastomus ) is from
Jamaica.
Although often cited as the source for MER-
MAID sightings, sirenians probably have less to
do with MERBEING mythology than SEALS. Of
the five listed here, two probably involve upriver
extensions of the range of the West African
manatee ( Trichechus senegalensis) ; the Lake Tit-
ICACA SEAL could just as well be a manatee; and
the St. HELENA Manatee is more than likely a
seal. Finally, reports of the persistence of
Steller’s Sea Cow in the North Pacific have
surfaced occasionally.

Manatee; Steller’s Sea Cow
Sirrush
Semimythical Beast of the Middle East.
Etymology: Akkadian (Semitic) word, trans-
lated as “dragon.” Plural, sirrushu. The proper
decipherment is now considered to be Mushush
or Musrush (plural, mushushu or musrushu ),
“glamorous snake.”
Physical description: Covered with scales.
Head like a snake’s, with folds of skin. Single
vertical horn on its head. Forked tongue. Long,
maned neck. Front legs of a lion. Back legs of an
eagle. Slender tail.
Significant sightings: This DRAGONlike animal
appears on bas-reliefs adorning the Ishtar Gate,
an arch built by the Babylonian king Neb-
uchadnezzar II in the sixth century B.C. that be-
came the chief ceremonial entrance to the city of
Babylon. The king’s inscription reads, in part:
“I placed wild bulls and ferocious dragons in the
gateways and thus adorned them with luxurious
splendor so that people might gaze on them in
wonder.” The wild bulls were probably Aurochs
{Bos primigenius) , which survived in Europe
until the seventeenth century. The gate was ex-
cavated in 1902 by Robert Koldewey near Bagh-
dad, Iraq, and is currently located in the Perga-
mon Museum in Berlin. Sirrushu also appear in
other Babylonian works of art and on cylinder
seals dating from as long ago as 2300 B.C.
In the Old Testament apocryphal book Bel
and the Dragon, Nebuchadnezzar II is said to
have kept a living dragon in the Temple of Bel
(from the Aramaic haal, “lord”) in Babylon. It
may be this animal that is depicted on the Ishtar
Gate. The book was written as an addition to
the Book of Daniel in the second century B.C.
Possible explanations:
(1) A depiction of a MOKELE-MBEMBE from
Central Africa or a distorted version based
on travelers’ tales about such a creature. The
extent of Mesopotamian knowledge about
Central Africa in the sixth century B.C. is
unknown. The Babylonians and the
Assyrians before them were not particularly
renowned for their seafaring prowess, but
their conquests and trading ventures put
them into contact with people who were. In
particular, the Egyptians may have had
contact with rain forest cultures as early as
3000 B.C. and were probably the first to
circumnavigate Africa about the same time
that the Ishtar Gate was built.
(2) Robert Koldewey identified the Sirrush
as an iguanodontid dinosaur, a family of
heavily built, bipedal or quadrupedal
herbivores known from the Cretaceous of
Europe and North Africa.
SIRRUSH 501
The SlRRUSH or Mushush of the Ishtar Gate, Babylon. (Fortean Picture Library)
(3) An unknown reptile from the Tigris
marshes, perhaps the Afa, suggested by
Peter Costello.
(4) The Desert monitor (Varanus griseus),
suggested by Burchard Brentjes. This
brownish-yellow lizard grows up to 3-4 feet
long and is found from North Africa to
Pakistan.
(5) An imaginary animal incorporating
certain characteristics of the Cheetah
(Acinonyx jubatus), proposed by Robert
Mertens.

502 SISEMITE
in darkish hair that reaches to the ground. Taller
and broader than a man. Head is like a human’s.
Big eyes. Said to have four fingers and no
thumb. Big toes are said to be turned backward.
Behavior: Mostly nocturnal. Walks bipedally

lonely trails and abduct women and children.
Habitat: Montane forests.
Distribution: North and west of Cubulco,
Guatemala; Nicaragua; Camasca Caverns and
Pico Bonito, Honduras; southern Quintana
Roo State, Mexico; Montanas Mayas, Belize.
Significant sightings: A Mayan carving at the
ruin of Xunantunich, Belize, discovered by Lars
Thomas, is said to show a Sisemite.
In 1912, the grandfather of Don Manuel
Majia ran into a Sisemite on Pico Bonito, Hon-
duras. It walked like a man and was tall and
hairy.
In 1932, while leading an expedition spon-
sored by the British Museum, Thomas Gann
glimpsed a large animal that ran on all fours in
a marshy area near the Rio Azul, Quintana Roo
State, Mexico. It had black, shaggy fur and a
white mane that obscured its face. He thought it
resembled a large ground sloth.
In the 1940s, a police complaint was made in
Coban, Guatemala, by Miguel Huzul, who al-
leged his son-in-law was delinquent for allowing
his daughter to be abducted by a Sisemite from
their home while he watched helplessly.
Possible explanations:
(1) A mythical entity, like the CANNIBAL
Giant or Little People.
(2) Giant Hominid or Hairy Biped of
Central America.
(3) An unknown species of primate or sloth
similar to the South American MAPINGUARI.

SISIUTL 503
Sivathere of Kish
Unknown HOOFED MAMMAL of the Middle
East.
Physical description: Robust body. Massive,
palmate antlers or horns on top of the head.
Two small, conical horns on the forehead in
back of the eyes. Large, broad nostrils.
Behavior: A halter is shown on its muzzle, im-
plying domestication or at least capture.
Significant sighting: In 1927 or 1928, during
an excavation of the Sumerian city of Kish, near
A1 Hillah in central Iraq, archaeologists un-
earthed a bronze chariot-ring that dates from
2800-2750 B.C. Inscribed on the ring was the
figure of a deerlike animal with large antlers.
Possible explanations:
(1) A Persian fallow deer ( Dama dama
mesopotamica ), suggested by David S. Reese.
The broken-off antlers on the artifact were
rediscovered in 1 977 and look much more
like this deer’s.
(2) A surviving sivathere, a member of a
subfamily of ox-sized giraffids from Eurasia
and Africa with a hefty build, relatively
short legs and neck, and branching, skin-
covered horns. These animals lived from 1 5
million years ago in the Late Miocene to the
Late Pleistocene. Other indications that
sivatheres may have persisted into historical
times include: an 8,000-year-old petroglyph
in a Saharan rock shelter; Syrian and
Egyptian figurines in the British Museum;
and a recently produced Russian statuette
and tin whistles from Siberia that depict an
animal with horns similar to a sivathere,
called Bramatherium. See also Ki-Lin.

southwestern United States.
Etymology: From the Navajo (Na-Dene) yee
naaldlooshii, “those who trot about with [a wolf
skin].”
Variant name: Yendalooshi.
Physical description: Height, 3 feet-5 feet 7
inches. Black hair. Reddish eyes. Face is nearly

ance and powers of the animal.
Distribution: Arizona; New Mexico.
Significant sightings: Scattered accounts of
HAIRY BlPED-like creatures in New Mexico
from 1965 to 1970 have been attributed to the
Skinwalker. In January 1970, a hairy man about
5 feet 7 inches tall kept pace with a car driven by
four youths near Whitewater, New Mexico.
They increased the speed from 45 to 60 miles
per hour, but it still kept up. Finally, one of
them shot it, and it fell down.

Skunk Ape
North American Ape of southern and central
Florida.
Etymology: From the animal’s intensely un-
pleasant smell.
Variant names: Abominable Florida apeman,
Abominable swamp slob, Bardin booger, Sand-
man, Squattam’s growler.
Physical description: Height, 5-9 feet. Hair
color, red to dark brown or black.
Behavior: Calls are a wide range of hoots,
whistles, and screams. Aggressive toward dogs
and humans. Seemingly vegetarian but may kill
livestock or small game.
Tracks: Usually five-toed prints, 8-19 inches
long. Three- or four-toed prints reported occa-
sionally, as are knuckle prints, sometimes with
opposed thumb. Toes dig in deeply.
Distribution: Southern Florida, from the Keys
north to the Brooksville area in the west and to
Palm Beach in the east.
Significant sightings: Trappers and fishermen
have told stories of Skunk apes since the 1920s,
but reports became frequent after the 1970s when
real estate developers invaded the Everglades.
H. C. Osborn (or Osbun) was camped out
near an Indian mound in the Fort Lauderdale
area in February 1971 when he looked out of his
tent and saw an 8-foot, 700-pound, apelike
creature standing a few feet away. It was covered
in light-brown hair and smelled awful. The next
morning, he found five-toed prints, 17.5 inches
long and 1 1 inches wide.
On June 7, 1975, twelve-year-old Ronnie
Steves woke up in his home east of Venice,
Florida, when he heard a disturbance in the
duck pen outside. Investigating, he saw a 6-
foot, dark, apelike animal that ran away. Inves-
tigators found 8-inch tracks with a discernible
arch.
Everglades Day Safari tour guide Dow
Roland saw a reddish-brown Skunk ape about
1 50 feet away from Turner River Road when he
had a half dozen tourists in his Ford van on July
18, 1997. The tourists got two glimpses of it as
it appeared briefly from the woods. However,
Roland and many of the adults thought it might
have been a man in an ape suit.

SKUNK APE 505
Photo of a possible Skunk APE taken in the fall of 2000 near the Myakka River, Florida. (Loren Coleman/David
Barkasy)
snapped a vague picture of a Skunk ape on July
21, 1997.
On September 8, 1998, David Shealy took
twenty-seven photos of a Skunk ape after an 8-
month vigil sitting in a tree in his backyard in
Collier County, Florida, though only one was
released to the public. Author and naturalist
James McMullen examined Shealy’s photos,
noting that the creature closely resembled the 7-
foot, 500-pound hairy primate that he had en-
countered in August 1997 when stalking pan-
thers in the Everglades. In July 2000, Shealy
videotaped an ape lurching through a field near
Ochopee, Florida.
In September or October 2000, a woman
took two photos of an orangutan-like creature
seen in a kneeling position in her backyard, near
the Myakka River, Florida. She estimated it was
7 feet tall. It had a strong odor and was making
“woomp” noises. The photos were sent anony-
mously to the Sarasota County sheriffs office,
since the woman did not want anybody on her
property.
Possible explanations:
(1) Hoaxers in ape suits.
(2) A Chimpanzee {Pan troglodytes) escaped
from a zoo, though no escapes were
reported.
(3) An unknown ape, as reported in other
wetlands of the southern and eastern United
States.
(4) A Hairy Biped.

Slaguggla
Giant Bird of Northern Europe.
Etymology: Swedish, “strike owl.”
Physical description: Large owl. Wingspan, 10
feet.
Behavior: Can lift prey as large as a reindeer
calf.
Distribution: Northern Sweden.
Possible explanation: The Ural owl ( Strix
uralensis ), although its wingspan is little more
than 2 feet, is indeed called the “strike owl” be-
cause of its tendency to strike out at anything it
encounters.

SLOTHS (Unknown)
The Order Xenarthra is a diverse group of New
World animals that includes anteaters, armadil-
los, and sloths. Xenarthrans (formerly called
edentates) have an extra point of articulation be-
tween each successive pair of vertebrae, giving
the spine additional strength.
Although all of the living sloths are arboreal,
there were four distinct families of fossil ground
sloths consisting of fifty genera, many of which
are well known from their mummified remains,
dried skin, and dung found in caves in the
southwestern United States and Patagonia. The
two most commonly invoked to explain the
four South American cryptids in this section are
Mylodon and Megatherium.
The Patagonian cave dweller {Mylodon dar-
winii) was covered in long, reddish- or yellow-
ish-brown hair; underneath the skin, it had
sturdy, pebblelike dermal ossicles. It was a graz-
ing animal that subsisted on grasses, herbs, and
roots. The most recent remains are dated at
8,600 years ago.
The Giant ground sloth ( Megatherium ameri-
SLOTHS 507
canum) could walk both on its hind legs and on
all fours. It was a browser, using the large,
curved claws on its front feet to pull down tree
branches. This 20-foot, elephant-sized sloth
ranged from Texas to Argentina from the Late
Pliocene, 1.9 million years ago, to as recently as
the Late Pleistocene, 8,000 years ago.

SMALL HOMINIDS
In this category are humanlike, hairy creatures
that are described as less than 5 feet tall. Unlike
the folkloric LITTLE PEOPLE, who are said to
shape-shift and have magical powers, Small ho-
minids seem to have a basis in physical reality.
Their bipedal gait, appearance, and behavior in-
dicate a closer association to humans (Ho-
MINIDS) than to apes or monkeys (PRIMATES).
The most likely fossil candidates are the aus-
tralopiths, small-statured hominids that
evolved from chimpanzee-like apes in African
tree-savanna habitats in the Late Miocene, 8-5
million years ago. More than 2,000 individual
fossils are known. Five species of “gracile” ho-
minids are known in the genus Australopithecus:
A. anamensis (Kenya, 4. 2-3. 9 million years
ago), A. afarensis (Ethiopia and Tanzania,
3. 9-2. 7 million years ago), A. bahrelghazali
(Chad, 3. 5-3.0 million years ago), A. africanus
(South Africa, 3. 0-2. 3 million years ago), and
A. gar hi (Ethiopia, 2.5 million years ago). An
additional undescribed species (3.3 million
years old) was discovered in 1999 in South
Africa. The number of species may well be un-
derestimated. Some taxonomists place A.
afarensis in the genus Homo.
Three other “robust” species of australopith
are sometimes placed in the genus Paranthropus:
P. robustus (South Africa, 1.8-1. 5 million years
ago), P. boisei (Tanzania, Kenya, and Ethiopia,
2. 3-1. 4 million years ago), and P. aethiopicus
(Ethiopia and Kenya, 2. 8-2.2 million years
ago). The distinction between gracile and robust
genera is now seen as unwarranted, since body
size is largely speculative. Robustness originally
referred to the heavy structure of the skulls.
Australopiths had apelike skulls, hominid
teeth, pronounced cheekbones, and projecting
jaws. The molars were heavy, with thick
enamel. A. afarensis males probably stood
about 4 feet 6 inches tall and weighed over 100
pounds; females stood about 3 feet 6 inches
and weighed about 60 pounds. The arms were
proportionately longer than in humans but
shorter than in apes. The chest tapered sharply
upward. Cranial capacity averaged 400-410
milliliters. Australopiths had an upright,
bipedal gait but apparently also climbed and
slept in trees. They were vegetarians, based on
their molar size, and probably ate leaves, fruit,
tubers, seeds, and insects. Although no stone
tools made by australopiths have been found,
some researchers think they were capable of
fashioning tools from wood, plant fiber, and
animal skins.
The best-known specimen of A. afarensis is
known as Lucy. She was found in 1974 at Oldu-
vai Gorge, Tanzania, and is considered by some
anthropologists, notably Donald Johanson, to
be ancestral to modern humans.
Other early hominids, such as Homo erectus,
H. ergaster, Neanderthals (H. neanderthalensis ) ,
and archaic H. sapiens , seemed to average at least
5 feet tall and are out of range for Small ho-
minid status.
Africa certainly has the widest variety of re-
ports on Small hominids, lending credence to
the theory of surviving australopiths. Isolated is-
land habitats often produce populations of
smaller size, thus making sightings from Sri
Lanka (Nittaewo), Sumatra (Orang Pendek),
and Borneo (Batutut) of particular interest.

SNAKES (Unknown)
The Snakes (Suborder Serpentes) are an ex-
tremely specialized group of reptiles character-
ized by elongated bodies, 125-400 supple verte-
brae, no limbs, no eyelids, flexible skulls that
allow for independent jaw movement, stretch-
able skin, potent digestive juices, forked tongues
that act as sensitive chemoreceptor systems, and
powerful axial muscles attached to ventral scutes
that provide flexible forward and lateral move-
ment. Some of the more familiar snake families
are Blindsnakes (Typhlopidae), Boas (Boidae),
Pythons (Pythonidae), Dwarf boas (Tropi-
dophiidae), Vipers (Viperidae), Stiletto snakes
(Atractaspididae), Ratsnakes and their kin (Col-
ubridae), Sea snakes (Hydrophiidae), and Co-
bras and their relatives (Elapidae).
The earliest known terrestrial snake, Lappar-
entophis y appeared in Algeria in the Early Creta-
ceous, 130 million years ago; the earliest marine
snake was Pachyrhachis y a serpent with tiny hind
legs from the Late Cretaceous, 97 million years
ago, that was discovered in Israel in 1997. There
are two competing theories about what kind of
reptiles the snakes evolved from — small, bur-
rowing lizards or aquatic, varanoid reptiles (the
group containing both monitors and
mosasaurs) — but the evidence remains ambigu-
ous. Snakes flourished for the past 65 million
years in the Cenozoic, developing such special-
ties as poison glands and vertebral neural spines.
The greatest official length for a Reticulated
python ( Python reticulatus ) is 32 feet 9.75
inches, recorded in 1912 on the north coast of
Sulawesi, Indonesia. It is the only species that
regularly exceeds 20 feet in length. The Ana-
conda ( Eunectes murinus) is also suspected of
reaching lengths greater than 30 feet (see GIANT
Anaconda), but sizes have often been exagger-
ated or poorly estimated. Gigantophis y an Egyp-
tian snake from the Middle Eocene, 45 million
years ago, grew to 33-37 feet long.
Unknown snakes are of interest to cryptozo-
ology if they are of unusual size or possess odd
physical attributes or behaviors. The thirty-four
snakes in this section are either gigantic (GlANT
Anaconda, Pumina), unusually big (Giant
Pennsylvania Snake, Colovia), hairy (Alger-
ian Hairy Viper), extremely venomous (Lum-
Mis’s Pichu-Cuate), unusually vocal
(Caribbean Crowing Snake), crested (Muh-
LAMBELA), horse- or cat-headed (SOUTH
African Horse-Headed Snake), able to jump
(Poskok), or leggy (Waigeo Six- Legged
Snake). Others are misidentifications that have
entered the literature (BOTHRODON PRIDII ,
Paraguayan Barking Snake). See also Flying
Reptiles.

South Bay Bessie
Freshwater Monster of Ohio.
Etymology: Named in the 1980s after the
Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station near Oak
Harbor, Ohio.
Variant names: Bessie, Lake Erie Larry, Lem-
mie.
Physical description: Serpentine. Length,
30-50 feet. Width, 2 feet. Gray, dark-greenish-
brown, or black. Long neck. Three to five
humps sometimes reported. Flat tail.
Behavior: Seen in calm waters. Swift swim-
mer. Moves by vertical undulations.
Distribution: Lake Erie, from Toledo and
Sandusky Bay east to Bay Village, Ohio.
Significant sightings: Capt. Shubael West and
the crew of the packet boat Delia observed a
35-40-foot serpent in 1817.
On July 21, 1931, Clifford Wilson and Fran-
cis Cogenstose were fishing off Sandusky when
a 20-foot serpent surfaced near their boat. After
jabbing it with an oar, they determined it was
dead and towed it to shore. It was said to have
an alligator-like head and was colored black,
dark green, and white. However, it was identi-
fied as an Indian python ( Python molurus), and
its captors turned out to be carnival workers on
tour.
In 1960, Ken Golic saw a large, cigar-shaped
animal while fishing off a pier near Sandusky on
a clear, calm night.
Demetrius Gooden and Frank Hughes were
fishing for walleye about 40 miles out from
Cleveland on June 10, 1985, when they saw a
long, black “alligator” only a few feet away from
their boat. The Coast Guard searched for forty
minutes but found nothing.
On September 11, 1990, Jim Johnson and
Steve Dircks saw a dark mass, 30-45 feet long
in three sections, in the lake near Huron, Ohio.
In July 1991, George Repicz took twenty sec-
onds of video footage that purportedly shows
Bessie off Kelleys Island. It may actually show a
floating log.
Possible explanations:
(1) Newspaper and other hoaxes, especially
from 1898 to 1931.
(2) Lake sturgeon ( Acipenser fulvescens) were
common in Lake Erie only up to the 1850s,
but they may be returning. This fish can
grow to 9 feet, although specimens over 7
feet are rarely reported. Its numerous bony
plates are a diagnostic feature.
(3) Floating logs.

SOUTH BAY BESSIE 511
Southern Narwhal
Tusked CETACEAN of the Antarctic.
Variant names : Sea unicorn, Uni.
Physical description: Whale with a long tusk.
Length, 10 feet.
Distribution: South Atlantic Ocean; Antarctic
waters.
Significant sightings: On October 5, 1615,
Dutch explorer Willem Corneliszoon Schouten
noted in his journal that one of his ships was
rammed by a sea monster in the mid-Atlantic.
The crew later found a foot-long horn stuck in
the prow.
On February 3, 1620, Augustin de Beaulieu
observed a dark-blue, porpoiselike animal with a
high fin and a tusk about 1-2 feet long in the
South Atlantic Ocean off South Africa.
On December 17, 1892, the crew of the ship
Balaena spotted a narwhal-like animal in the
Bransfield Strait off the Antarctic Peninsula.
Possible explanations:
(1) A Swordfish {Xiphias gladius) sword
looks like a tusk or horn, but the swordfish
is tropical.
(2) An unrecognized variety of Narwhal
(. Monodon monoceros) that lives in Antarctic
waters. Narwhals are known only from
above the Arctic Circle.
(3) A surviving Double-tusked whale
( Odobenocetops peruvianus ), known from a
single skull found in 1993 in southern Peru
that dates from the Pliocene, 5 million years
ago. Its tusks, however, pointed downward,
walrus-fashion.

Significant sightings: On two occasions, once
in the early 1970s and again in 1991, hunters
were said to have killed specimens of this cat in
Peru.
Possible explanations: An aberrant Jaguar

512 SOUTHERN NARWHAL
The Great Sphinx of Giza, after its 1925—1934 excavation by Emile Baraize. (From a postcard in the author’s
collection)
Significant sighting: On March 11, 1959, vet-
eran diver Bob Wall encountered a strange ani-
mal while diving in shallow water 2 miles off
Miami Beach to point out coral to tourists in
the glass-bottomed Comrade II. He got a close
look at it but surfaced when it started coming
toward him.
Present status : Only reported once.
Possible explanations:
(1) Bob Wall has insisted it wasn’t an
octopus, crab, or spiny lobster.
(2) Karl Shuker thinks that the stalked eyes
are indicative of a crustacean, most likely a
large Spiny lobster ( Panulirus argus ), which
enjoys hiding in reef crevices. However, this
creature rarely grows larger than 2 feet long.
The only crustacean that comes close to 5
feet is the Japanese spider crab ( Macrocheira
kaempferi ), which is only found off
southeastern Japan.

Sphinx
Semimythical Beast of ancient North Africa.
Etymology: Greek, possibly meaning “stran-
gle” or “grasp.”
Variant names: Abu hoi (Arabic/Semitic, “Fa-
ther of terror”), Harmakhis, Hor-m-akhet
(Egyptian, “Horus is on the horizon”).
Physical description: In Egyptian art, a reclin-
ing figure with a human head (usually male)
adorned with a royal headdress feme ft, a nar-
row, stylized beard; and the mane and body of a
lion. Sometimes, the Sphinx had the head of a
ram or a hawk fused with a lion’s body. The
concept was adopted by the Greeks, Hittites,
and Assyrians. In Greek art, the Sphinx had the
head and breasts of a woman and the wings of
an eagle.
Behavior: In Greek mythology, the Sphinx sat
on a mountain and asked travelers a riddle; if
they failed to answer correctly, it killed them.
However, Oedipus solved the riddle, and the
Sphinx threw itself off a precipice.
Distribution: Egypt; Mount Phikios, west of
Thivai, central Greece.

240 feet long and 66 feet high. The date of its
construction is not known for certain, but it is
usually ascribed to the Fourth Dynasty pharaoh
Khafre (Chephren), who ruled from 2558 to
2532 B.C. (Controversial evidence involving
water erosion has led some Egyptologists to
place it much earlier.) It was apparently carved
from a rock outcrop remaining after the blocks
for the Great Pyramid of Khufu had been quar-
ried. Many other smaller Egyptian Sphinx
sculptures exist, including a rare female-headed
Sphinx representing the Eighteenth Dynasty
queen Hatshepsut (1498-1483 B.C.).
Present status: Contrary to frequent state-
ments, the Great Sphinx did not lose its nose
because either the French or the Mamelukes
used it for cannon target practice in the late
1790s; the broken nose is shown in Friderik
Norden’s drawing in 1755. Before the fifteenth
century, someone pried it off by hammering
long rods or chisels into it, one below the bridge
and the other under a nostril; the marks are still
there. Tomb robbers and others would often re-
move the noses from Egyptian sculptures in
order to deprive them of breath or potency.
Possible explanations:
(1) The face of the Great Sphinx is accepted
by most Egyptologists as Pharaoh Khafre.
The lion was a solar symbol as well as a sign
of royalty. Fiuman-headed Sphinxes
represent the king as guardian of the
temple — in this case, the Old Kingdom
Sphinx temple that rests at the feet of the
Great Sphinx. Ram-headed Sphinxes lined
the processional way leading to the god
Amun at Karnak, and hawk-headed
Sphinxes are associated elsewhere with the
god Re.
(2) Some Greek and Roman authors
considered Sphinxes to be based on
monkeys or baboons, and this identification
was repeated in the medieval bestiaries.
(3) The Gelada baboon ( Theropithecus
geladd) was suggested by Bernard
Fieuvelmans for the body of the Greek
Sphinx because of its lionlike body and tail,
as well as the chest patch of naked pink
skin; in the female, this patch is surrounded
by a necklace of fleshy, white, breastlike sacs
that swell and redden during estrus. The
historian Philostorgios, in the fifth century
A.D., was the first to identify the Sphinx
with this animal, after seeing a gelada
himself in Africa.
(4) Pausanias cited a story basing the Greek
myth on a female pirate whose band used
Mount Phikios as a base of operations until
Oedipus captured her with an
overwhelming army from Corinth.

514 SPHINX
Spinifex Man
Supposed Giant Hominid of Australia.
Etymology : After spinifex, a drought-resistant
Australian desert grass.
Physical description: Height, 1 0 feet.
Behavior: Bipedal.
Tracks: Two toes. Length, 10-15 inches.
Distribution: Central Western Australia, near
Laverton.
Significant sighting: In 1970, Peter Muir came
across odd, two-toed tracks in the outback near
Laverton, Western Australia.
Possible explanation: Ostrich ( Struthio
camelus) farms were begun in South Australia in
the early twentieth century, but the industry
only became commercially viable in the 1990s.
In leaner times, the birds were often let loose to
fend for themselves. Their distinctively large,
two-toed feet (as opposed to those of the
smaller, three- toed emu) match the tracks found
by Muir.

Physical description: Small, spotted antelope.
Distribution: Liberia.

Spotted Lion
Unknown big Cat of East and Central Africa.
Scientific name: Panthera leo maculatus , given
by Bernard Heuvelmans in 1955.
Variant names: Abasambo (in Ethiopia),
BAKANGA, Bung bung (in Cameroon), IKIMIZI,
Marozi (Gikuyu/Bantu word, possibly meaning
“solitary lion”), NTARARGO.
Physical description: Smaller than a lion but
larger than a leopard. Body length, 5 feet 10
inches. Tawny color. Covered with grayish-
brown spots or rosettes on the back, sides, and
legs. Spine is free of spots. Diameter of rosettes,
2-3 inches. Lionlike face. Male has a slight
mane of side- whiskers. Retractile claws. Tail, 2
feet 9 inches.
Behavior: Usually travels in lion-lioness pairs
or small prides. Will attack cattle.
Tracks: Catlike, in size between those of a
leopard and those of a lion. Thinner than those
of a young lion.
Habitat: Forested mountains.
Distribution: Mount Kenya, the Aberdare
Range, and the Mau Escarpment in Kenya;
Ruwenzori Mountains, Uganda; Virunga Vol-
canos area, Rwanda; Ethiopia; Cameroon;
Ubangi region, Central African Republic.
Significant sightings: Naturalist A. Blayney
Percival shot a Spotted lioness and her cubs in
Kenya in 1924.
Game warden R. E. Dent saw four large,
spotted cats in 1931 on Mount Kenya at an al-
titude of 10,000-11,000 feet. A few months
later, his trappers in the Aberdare Range, Kenya,
snared a cat that looked like a cross between a
lion and a leopard, but they let it go.
In the 1930s, at an altitude of 10,000 feet,
Michael Trent shot two small Spotted lions, a
male and a female, that had raided his farm in
the Aberdare Range, Kenya. He preserved the
skins but not the skulls or skeletons.
In 1935, Kenneth Gandar Dower headed an
expedition into the Kenya highlands to look for
the Spotted lion, but all he managed to find
were some unusual tracks at an elevation of
12,500 feet.
Present status: Probably extinct in Kenya,
since there have been no sightings since the
1930s.
Possible explanations:
(1) The appearance of spots could be a trick
of light and shadow in some instances.
(2) A subspecies of Lion ( Panthera leo)
adapted to mountainous terrain might have
developed spots for camouflage and a
smaller size for more agility. Gandar Dower
hoped this would turn out to be the case, if
the animal was not a completely new
species.
SPOTTED LION 515
Spotted lions shot by Michael Trent in the 1930s in the Aberdare Range, Kenya. From a painting by William M.
Rebsamen. (William M. Rebsamen/Fortean Picture Library)
(3) Rare occurrences of adult lions retaining
their juvenile spots are known.
(4) A male Leopard (P. pardus) x lioness
hybrid, called a Leopon, was first bred in
captivity at the Koshien Zoo in
Nishinomiya, Japan, in November 1959.
This hybrid is heavily spotted, has a poorly
developed mane, and is intermediate in size
between a leopard and a lion. However,
such an animal’s occurrence in the wild is
unlikely due to behavioral and distribution
differences.
(5) A population of Somali lions (P. /.
somaliensis) that migrated from Somalia to
Kenya and developed spotted coats,
suggested by W. Robert Foran.

Springheel Jack
Mysterious FLYING HUMANOID of Victorian
England.
Variant names : Leaping terror, Springald,
Spring-heeled Jack, Suburban ghost.
Physical description: Tall. Thin. Glowing red
eyes. Huge, pointed ears. Blue flames emanate
from its mouth. Fingers are exceptionally sharp
(“made of iron”). Wears a long cloak (or an oil-
skin or sheepskin) and a shining helmet.
Behavior: Seems to be able to leap or glide
through the air with a paranormal ability.
Laughs ringingly. Attacks people and rips their
clothing and flesh.
Significant sightings: First noted in September
1837 when attacks on three young women took
place in Barnes Common, Middlesex, England.
On October 11, 1837, seventeen-year-old Polly
Adams was assaulted on Shooter’s Hill Road,
London, by a bizarre, leaping figure. Next,
eighteen-year-old Jane Alsop was attacked at her
front door on February 18, 1838, by a man who
claimed to be a policeman but who slashed at
her clothing with metallic claws. The attacks
continued through 1839 and reoccurred in
London in 1843 and 1845 (resulting in
Springheel Jack’s only murder, involving a thir-
teen-year-old prostitute named Maria Davis
whom he threw into a sewer). Similar assaults
were noted in Caistor-on-Sea, Norfolk, and
Aldershot, Hampshire, in 1877. The final ap-
pearance of the creature took place in Everton,
Bedford, in September 1904, when a figure like
a giant bat was seen leaping from rooftop to
rooftop.
Possible explanations:
(1) In the 1830s, police theorized that a
criminal was using springs concealed in his
boot heels. Henry de la Poer Beresford, the
marquis of Waterford (1811-1859), was
considered a suspect. However, no known
alloy is compressible and resilient enough to
account for the reported leaps made by
Springheel Jack.
(2) Newspaper writers theorized that the
attacks were made by a “ghost, a bear, or a
devil” because a letter had been received
claiming that a rich man had wagered he
could visit London suburbs disguised as one
of these creatures.
(3) An unidentified flying object (UFO)
entity, similar to other FLYING HUMANOIDS,
suggested by J. Vyner.
(4) An escaped Kangaroo (Family
Macropodidae), though the absence of one
of these animals from a Victorian zoo would
surely have been reported.
(5) A fictional story in which Springheel
Jack is a nobleman who is cheated out of his
inheritance and becomes a highwayman to
steal from the unscrupulous rich first
appeared in 1875 as a forty-eight-part serial
by penny-dreadful writer Charlton Lea.
This literary Springheel Jack was demonic;
was dressed in a crimson suit; and had
batlike wings, horns, talons, cloven hooves,
and sulphurous breath. His leaps were
accomplished by the use of steel rods and
springs. Much of the legend seems to derive
from this narrative, which was picked up by
other sensational writers.
(6) A series of hoaxes, perhaps including an
original one by the marquis of Waterford
himself, who apparently was something of a
trickster. The story of a wraithlike
Springheel Jack has been perpetuated in
urban legend and adolescent pranks ever
since.

Steller 5 s Sea Ape
Unknown SEAL or MERBEING of the North Pa-
cific Ocean.
Etymology: George S teller said the creature re-
sembled the picture of an animal called Simla
marina danica (Danish sea monkey) in Konrad
Gesner’s Historia animalium (1558). But Ges-
ner’s animal appears to be a nonexistent, com-
posite beast.
Scientific names: Siren cynodephala, given by
Johann Julius Walbaum in 1792; Trichechus hy-
dropithecus, suggested by George Shaw in 1800;
and Manatus simia, proposed by Johann Karl
Wilhelm Illiger prior to 1811.
Variant name: Steller’s sea monkey.
Physical description: Length, 5 feet. Reddish
color overall but grayer on the back and reddish-
white on the underside. Tapering body. Doglike
head. Pointed, erect ears. Large eyes. Drooping
whiskers. No visible front flippers. Bilobate tail,
with the upper lobe twice as large as the lower.
Behavior: Extremely playful. Can raise itself
out of the water one-third of its length and re-
main in position for several minutes. Feeds on
Bull kelp ( Nereocystis luetkeana ) common in the
Gulf of Alaska.
Distribution: Gulf of Alaska.
Significant sightings: On August 10, 1741,
German naturalist Georg Wilhelm Steller,
aboard the Saint Peter, observed a strange sea
mammal about 260 miles south of Kodiak Is-
land in the Gulf of Alaska. It played around the
ship for two hours, approaching as close as 16
feet, looking at the crew, and diving underneath
the ship to emerge on the other side.
In June 1965, Miles Smeeton, on his ketch
the Tzu Hang, observed a sheep-sized animal
with long, reddish-yellow hair and a droopy
mustache 4 miles off the north coast of Atka in
the Aleutian Islands, Alaska. Its head looked
more like a dog’s than a seal’s.
Present status: Only two observations, 200
years apart.
Possible explanations:
(1) A young Northern fur seal ( Callorhinus
ursinus) was suggested by Leonhard
Stejneger, although Steller and the rest of the
crew were familiar with certain types of seals.
However, the first time Steller saw a fur seal
was later, on the rookeries of Ostrov Bering
in the Commander Islands. Steller may have
mistaken the seal’s hind flippers for a tail.
(2) A young specimen of an unknown
Arctic variety of Leopard seal ( Hydrurga
leptonyx ), according to Roy Mackal. This
seal has no external ears, however.
(3) A stray Hawaiian monk seal (Monachus
schauinslandi) matches the animal in size
and behavior, but this seal rarely wanders
far from the Hawaiian Islands and similarly
has no external ears.
(4) A Sea otter ( Enhydra lutris ), though Steller
was also familiar with this animal, which does
not get much larger than 2 feet long.
(5) A juvenile specimen of Bernard
518 SQUOLK-TY-MISH
Heuvelmans’s hypothetical elongated seal.

Steller’s Sea Cow
A large SlRENIAN of the North Pacific Ocean,
presumed extinct since 1768.
Scientific name: Hydrodamalis gigas y given by
Eberhard Zimmerman in 1780.
Variant name: Kapustnik (Russian, “cabbage-
eater ).
Physical description: Length, 20-26 feet.
Weight, up to 10 metric tons. Tough, dark-
brown skin. Rotund body. Small head. No
functional teeth. Bilobate tail.
Behavior: Average submergence time, four to
five minutes. Strictly a seaweed-eater.
Distribution: Gulf of Anadyr, Siberia; Com-
mander Islands in the Bering Sea; Attu, Alaska.
Significant sightings: A. E. Nordenskiold in-
terviewed several residents of Bering Island who
affirmed that sea cows were still being killed and
eaten there in the late 1770s. Around 1854, two
other natives, Merchenin and Stepnoff, appar-
ently saw an animal in the ocean that spouted
water from its mouth.
Polish naturalist Benedykt Dybowski was cer-
tain that sea cows had survived off Bering Island
as late as 1830.
Lucien Turner interviewed an Aleut woman
who said that her father had seen sea cows off
Attu in the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, in the mid-
nineteenth century.
A sea cow allegedly was stranded on the shore
of the Gulf of Anadyr, Siberia, in 1910.
In the early 1950s, a harpooner named Ivan
Skripkin told of 32-foot, finless animals that ap-
peared every July not far from Bering Island.
The crew of the Russian whaler Buran ob-
served six dark-skinned marine animals, 20-26
feet long, feeding in a lagoon near Cape Nava-
rin, Chukot Autonomous Province, Siberia, in
July 1962. They had small heads, bilobate tails,
and bifurcated upper lips.
Russian fisherman Ivan Nikiforovich Che-
chulin walked up to and touched a live sea cow
in the summer of 1976 at Anapkinskaya Bay,
south of Cape Navarin. Its tail was forked like a
whale’s, and it had a long snout.
Present status: S teller’s sea cow was discovered
in 1741 by German naturalist Georg Wilhelm
Steller when he was shipwrecked on Ostrov
Bering in the Commander Islands off Siberia.
Fur hunters made regular visits to the island
from 1743 to 1763, eating the reputedly tasty
flesh of the animal. During that time, its range
was limited to the Commander Islands, but dur-
ing the Pleistocene, it had ranged along the Pa-
cific Rim from Japan to Baja California. Most
authorities agree that S teller’s sea cow was ex-
tinct by 1768, although A. E. Nordenskiold
thought the animal lingered in the Comman-
ders another ninety years.
Possible explanations:
(1) A female Narwhal (. Monodon monoceros)
is about the same size and does not have the
distinctive tusk of the male. A rare visitant
to Siberian waters, this was probably the
animal seen in 1854.
(2) Bernard Heuvelmans suggested that a
different, more agile species of Hydrodamalis
survived in waters along the mainland.
(3) The 1976 sighting may have been a
stray Northern elephant seal ( Mirounga
angustirostris) . This large seal has a bilobate
tail and sometimes wanders from its normal
migration route to the Gulf of Alaska and
the Aleutian Islands in the spring.

Significant sightings: Indian traditions of the
slaying of animals called Big buffalo, Big bull,
Great elk, or Stiff-legged bear were preserved by
various language groups throughout North
America. The Tuscarora of New York have a leg-
end of the Big quisquis, a monster that invaded
their settlement near Lake Ontario and was
driven off with great loss of life. Other monsters,
the Great elk and the Oyahguaharb, were also
killed by the ancestors of the Tuscaroras.
English sailor David Ingram and two com-
panions were set ashore in October 1567 some-
where on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico and
managed to walk all the way to Maine over the
next two years. Along the way, they encoun-
tered a large beast twice as big as a horse that
had “two teeth or horns,” each a foot long, com-
ing out of its snout. Although this conceivably
could have been a Moose ( Alces alces ), Ingram
explicitly claimed to have seen elephants. Sea-
narrative compiler Richard Hakluyt included
Ingram’s narrative in his first edition of 1589
but omitted it in later editions, apparently hav-
ing concluded that it was either too unreliable
or incoherent.
In 1762, John Wright of Kentucky talked to
several Shawnee Indians about fossil skeletons
found along the Ohio River. They said the
bones belonged to the “father of all buffalo,”
STIFF-LEGGED BEAR 521
which had been hunted many years ago. But the
Great Spirit destroyed the enormous animals
with lightning.
On January 7, 1811, explorer David Thomp-
son was near the Athabasca River, Alberta, in
the Rocky Mountains when he found the tracks
of a large animal in the snow. There were four
large, clawed toes 4 inches long, and the prints
were 14 inches long by 8 inches wide. The local
Indians and French Canadian trappers had
heard rumors of “mammoths” in the nearby
hills, where the creatures fed on moss and other
plants.
Artifacts and petroglyphs: Hilborne T. Cres-
son and W. L. deSuralt allegedly found an in-
scribed whelk shell in a peat deposit near the
Holly Oak, Delaware, train depot in 1864. A
realistic drawing of a woolly mammoth is
etched on the surface. Cresson did not report
the discovery until December 1889. The shell
itself was dated in 1987 to about A.D.
750-1000, so the artwork cannot be a life de-
piction of a mammoth. There is evidence to
suggest that Cresson obtained a Fort An-
cient-period whelk in Ohio when he worked
as an archaeologist there and forged a mam-
moth engraving based on the La Madeleine
carving found in the Dordogne region of
France in 1864. John C. Kraft and Ronald A.

The Lenape stone is a slate gorget found by
Barnard Hansell, who was plowing in his fa-
ther’s field east of Doylestown, Pennsylvania, in
1872. He kept it with his collection of Native
American relics, then sold it in 1881 to Henry
D. Paxon. Hansell coincidentally found a bro-
ken-off fragment of the gorget in the same field
a few months later. The artifact is remarkable
for its carved depiction of a realistic-looking
mammoth confronted by a human stick figure
with a bow and a spear. Widely considered a
nineteenth-century fraud by archaeologists, the
artifact is in the Mercer Museum in
Doylestown. Henry Chapman Mercer, The

In October and November 1924, an expedi-
tion led by archaeologist Samuel Hubbard and
paleontologist Charles W. Gilmore explored the
Havasu Canyon area on the Havasupai Indian
Reservation west of the Grand Canyon in
northern Arizona. Near where the Tobocobe
Trail intersects Lee Canyon, they discovered
pictographs on the red sandstone along the trail,
one of which seems to show a man and an ele-
phant. Oakland Museum, Discoveries Relating to

A petroglyph along the Colorado River Road
north of Moab, Utah, seems to represent a
mastodon or mammoth. About 2-3 feet long,
the image has a trunk, tusk, and elephantine
toes. One interpretation is that it is spraying its
back with water from its trunk. Another petro-
glyph near the Butler Wash-San Juan River
522 STIFF-LEGGED BEAR
confluence area, Utah, shows a possible
mastodon on the chest of a large anthropo-
morph. “The Moab Mastodon Pictograph,” Sci-
entific Monthly 41 (1935): 378-379; Beej
Averitt and Paul Averitt, “Mastodon of Moab,”

Possible explanations:
(1) The taxonomy of animals in Native
American legends is not very precise. Large
animals tend to be referred to as bears,
buffalo, beavers, and ogres fairly
interchangeably. George Lankford thinks
there is no reason to go beyond the Brown
bear ( Ursus arctos) as an explanation for
most of these myths.
(2) A survival of the Columbian mammoth
(. Mammuthus columbi ), a true elephant
(Family Elephantidae), into relatively recent
times. The Columbian mammoth ranged
from Alaska and the Yukon across the
midwestern United States and south into
Mexico and Central America. Standing
almost 14 feet at the shoulder and weighing
8-10 tons, the mammoth could consume
about 700 pounds of vegetation a day. The
earliest mammoth remains in North
America date from about 1.7 million years
ago, while the most recent fossils of any
mammoths or mastodons in the Americas
date from about 10,000 years ago. Human
tools and weapons have often been found in
association with mammoths, but the extent
to which the animals were actively hunted,
as opposed to being scavenged, is still a
matter for debate. Archaeological sites
associated with mammoth remains cluster
around 11,200 years ago.
(3) A survival of the American mastodon
( Mammut americanum) into relatively recent
times. The American mastodon ranged from
Alaska to central Mexico, stood 7-10 feet at
the shoulder, and weighed 6 tons. The
mastodon was a member of the Family
Mammutidae and, though superficially
similar to the elephants, was an earlier
offshoot of the proboscidean tree. Early
elephant-like animals called mammutids
and gomphotheres first arrived in North
America from Siberia about 16 million years
ago, in the Late Miocene. They spread to
South America in the Pleistocene when
water levels subsided enough to form the
Isthmus of Panama. Mastodons have only
rarely been found with human artifacts, but
some skeletons bear marks associated with
butchery.
(4) Edward Tylor speculates that the
Indians may have generated the myths in
order to explain large fossil bones.
(5) Elephants in Mesoamerican art have
been explained as stylized depictions of
Fruit-eating bats (Artibeus spp.), Turtles
(Order Testudines), or Macaws (parrots of
the genera Ara and Anodorhynchus ) .
(6) Pre-Columbian visits by Asian or
Phoenician cultures may have introduced
elephant motifs to New World artists.
(7) The Giant short-faced bear (. Arctodus
simus) lived in North America from 36,000
to 5,000 years ago. A fearsome predator that
stood 1 1 feet high on its hind legs and
weighed 2,500 pounds, it would have made
a strong impression on the Paleo-Indians.

Stors j oodj uret
Freshwater Monster of Sweden.
Etymology: Swedish, “Storsjo monster.”
Variant names: Storsie, Thelma.
Physical description: Serpentine. Length,
10-45 feet. Width, 3-4 feet. Shiny skin, green-
ish to grayish. Round head like a cat’s or a dog’s,
3 feet wide. Reports from the nineteenth cen-
tury describe a horselike head with a long, white
mane. Large, dark eyes. Long, sail-like ears (or
dorsal crest) that it presses back against its neck.
Long, flickering tongue. Neck, 8-10 feet long.
Multiple humps. Two pairs of stumpy legs or
fins. Powerful tail.
Behavior: Most active in the summer. Swims
swiftly, perhaps as fast as 45 miles per hour. Said
to make a wailing or a rattling noise.
Distribution: Storsjon Lake, Jamtland
County, Sweden. Sightings have primarily been
in the narrow arms of the lake south of Froson
Island.
Significant sightings: Around 1839, Aron An-
dersson and others at Hackas watched a red-gray
animal with a head like a horse’s and a white
mane swimming away from the shore.
Marta and Karin Olsson were washing clothes
on the beach near Sorbyn on October 13, 1893,
when they saw an animal’s head rising and falling
in the water. After Karin threw some stones at it,
it swam swiftly toward the shore. The women ran
but saw the animal submerge eventually.
In 1894, amusement-park owner Maria
Helin and other citizens of Ostersund formed a
company to try to capture the animal. Even
King Oscar II made a financial contribution.
They constructed a jetty into the lake and hired
a Norwegian whaler, harpoons at the ready, to
watch for any activity. A huge trap was set under
the jetty, and large hooks were baited and
placed at various points around the lake, but the
company met with no success. The trap and
other equipment are in the Jamtland Museum.
On July 14, 1931, Anders Bergqvist and
Jonas Hansson saw two humps in the water at
Myrviken.
Anna Rahm observed a gray animal, 9 feet
long and with a powerful tail and large ears, at
Assjon on August 12, 1947. Its tongue moved
up and down threateningly, and its eyes rolled.
On August 10, 1983, Carina Johnsson took
photographs of a large, swiftly moving animal in
the bay of Brunfloviken.
An alleged embryo of Storsjoodjuret was
found on the shore on June 18, 1984. It has
been at the Jamtland Museum since 1985.
Gun-Britt Widmark took a video of a 33-39-
foot animal in July 1996 while he was boating
off Ostersund.
On August 8, 1997, Elin and Cecilia Hem-
reus saw the animal’s head and one arched loop
of its body from only 30 feet away while they
were swimming near Tippskar Island. The head
was horselike, with two black eyes on the sides;
the neck was about 6 feet long. The body had
large, round scales like armored plates.
A woman in Brunflo saw a serpentine mon-
ster swimming 90 feet offshore in July 2000. It
was 20-25 feet long and golden with a blackish
back.
Possible explanations:
(1) A floating log.
(2) Ducks or other waterfowl swimming in
a row.
(3) A large fish, possibly a Weis catfish
{Silurus glanis), which grows up to 16 feet
and is found in Scandinavia, Russia, and
Eastern Europe. The largest wels in Sweden
weighed 132.5 pounds and was caught in
1981.
(4) A misidentified boat wake.

Striped Jaguar
Mystery Cat of South America.
Variant name: Striped tiger.
Physical description: The same size as a jaguar,
which grows to about 5 feet long. Tan, with
tigerlike stripes. Head slightly narrower than a
jaguar’s. Fangs about the same size as a jaguar’s.
Behavior: Sometimes tracks hunters.
Habitat: Rain forest.
Distribution: Rio Abujao, Ucayali Depart-
ment; Pozuzo, Huanuco Department; Rio Pal-
cazu, Pasco Department, Peru. Also reported in
Colombia and Ecuador.
Significant sighting: Peter Hocking acquired a
skull of this animal in 1992; a hunter had shot
the creature in the Pozuzo region of Peru. It ap-
parently exhibits several features distinguishing it
from a jaguar’s skull, but it remains undescribed.
Possible explanations: An aberrant Jaguar
(. Panthera onca ), a morph, or a new species.

Stripeless Tiger
Odd Cat of the Indian subcontinent.
Physical description: Uniformly brown or
whitish coat.
Habitat: Open, sandy areas.
Distribution: Similipal Tiger Reserve, Orissa
State, India.
Significant sightings: Four reports were
recorded between 1961 and July 27, 1988,
when a guard in the reserve saw a Stripeless tiger
walking away from a salt lick. It left behind a
footprint.
Possible explanation: Undescribed genetic
morph.

Stymphalian Bird
Unknown Bird of Southern Europe.
Etymology: After the lake.
Physical description: Ibislike. Size of a stork or
crane. Sharp, hooked beak. Sharp talons.
Behavior: Nests in reeds or on cliffs. Screech-
like call. Said to eat humans.
Habitat: Marshes.
Distribution: Lake Stymphalos, Arcadia,
Greece. Said to breed in the Arabian Desert.
Significant sighting: One of the labors of the
ancient Greek hero Herakles was to rid Greece
of these noisy birds, which he did by scaring
them off with rattles.
Possible explanations:
(1) A personification of the diseases that
infest marshy areas.
(2) The Northern bald ibis ( Geronticus
eremita :), suggested by Michel Desfayes. Not
found in Greece any longer and by no
means ferocious, this bird is dark green with
a bright-red bill and breeds on cliffs. It
lingered in Turkey in small numbers but
became extinct there in 1989.

Succarath
Unknown SLOTH-like animal of South America.
Etymology: From the Tehuelche su (“cloak”) +
carrath (“skin”).
Variant name: Su.
Physical description: Long tail.
Behavior: Carries its young on its back and
shields them with its tail. Hunted by Indians,
who made cloaks of its skin.
Habitat: Riverbanks.
Distribution: Southern Argentina; Chile.
Present status: Probably extinct since the late
Middle Ages.
Possible explanation: Could represent a surviv-
ing Patagonian cave-dwelling sloth (. Mylodon
darwinii ), sub fossil remains of which are known
from the Cueva del Milodon in southern Chile.
Its thick skin may have been prized by the Indi-
ans as armor.

Sulawesi Lake Crocodile
Undescribed CROCODILIAN of Southeast Asia.
Habitat: Freshwater lakes.
Distribution: Sulawesi, Indonesia.
Possible explanations:
(1) A remnant population of the Siamese
crocodile ( Crocodylus siamensis), which was
formerly found in lakes on Java, Sumatra,
and Kalimantan.
(2) An existing population of False gharial
( Tomistoma schlegelii ), a narrow-snouted
crocodilian that is found in peninsular
Malaysia, Sumatra, and Kalimantan.
(3) A surviving Pleistocene crocodile known
from fossils in the southwest of the island.

Sumatran Hummingbird
Mystery Bird of Southeast Asia.
Physical description: Like a hummingbird.
Length, 1.5 inches. Yellowish. Striped. Dark-
brown underparts.
Distribution: Sumatra, Indonesia.
Significant sighting: Otto and Nina Irrgang
saw a tiny bird twice in Sumatra in 1957 and
1958. On one occasion, it flew only a foot away
from their faces.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Orange-bellied flowerpecker
( Dicaeum trigono stigma). Scarlet-backed
flowerpecker (D. cruentatum ), and several
related species found in Sumatra are some
of the smallest birds on the island, only
about 3.5 inches long. The Yellow-breasted
flowerpecker ( Prionochilus maculatus) has a
brown back and a yellow breast with brown
streaks but is slightly larger.
(2) The Ruby-cheeked sunbird (Anthreptes
singalensis) and the Purple-throated sunbird
SUMATRAN HUMMINGBIRD 527
( Nectarinia sperata ) are only about 4 inches
long.
(3) Hummingbirds (Family Trochilidae) are
found only in the Americas. The smallest is
the Bee hummingbird (. Mellisuga helenae) of
Cuba, which, at 2.24 inches long, is also the
smallest living bird. The bird seen by the
Irrgangs is even tinier and would make it
the world’s smallest.
(4) A large butterfly, moth, or wasp of some
kind.

Sumske Dekle
WlLDMAN of Eastern Europe.
Etymology: Croatian, “forest girls.”
Variant names: Divi-te zeni (Bulgarian),
Divje devoijke (Slovenian), Divji moz (Sloven-
ian, for the male), Divozenky (Czech), Dwiwje
zony (Sorbian), Dziwo-zony (Polish).
Physical description: Covered with reddish or
black hair, except for the face. Large, square
head. Long, strong hands.
Behavior: Shrieks and screams. Sometimes
visits houses or stables in search of warmth or
food. Said to harvest grain, bake bread, catch
game and fish, and weave hemp into clothing.
Able to breed with humans.
Habitat: Woodlands.
Distribution: Between Novigrad Podravski
and Ferdinandovac, Croatia.
Significant sighting: One winter around 1870,
two brothers named Paurovic were sleeping in
their stable at Severovac, Croatia, when one
woke up to find a hairy forest girl standing be-
tween them. He touched it, and it ran out the
door. They gave chase but could not catch it in
the deep snow.
Present status: Stories about these creatures
died out after World War I.

Super-Eel
A category of Sea MONSTER identified by
Bernard Heuvelmans.
Physical description: Serpentine or cylindrical
body. Length, 30-100 feet. Several color vari-
eties apparently occur. One is blackish-brown or
blue on top and white underneath; others are
speckled or reddish. Head may be blunt or
pointed. Large eyes. Mouth is either at the end
of the head or at the bottom. Neck is a contin-
uation of the body. A continuous, translucent
dorsal fin begins some distance from the head. A
pair of pectoral fins is sometimes reported. Long
tail tapers to a point.
Behavior: Swims on the surface with a rapid,
undulating motion. Mouth opens and closes
spasmodically when moving forward. It has
been seen fighting with whales.
Habitat: Abyssal depths of the ocean. Comes
to the surface only in exceptional circumstances.
Distribution: Cosmopolitan, though the
speckled variety seems confined to the Mediter-
ranean Sea.
Significant sightings: In the 1740s, Sicilian
fishermen were familiar with large, speckled ser-
pentine fishes — possibly large moray eels — that
ruined their nets and let the tuna they had
caught escape.
On October 15, 1870, John Adams and the
crew of his boat saw a 30-40-foot, reddish ani-
mal about a mile off the coast of Norfolk Island
528 SUMSKE DEKLE
Sea serpent resembling a SUPER-EEL. From Konrad
Gesner, Historiae animalium (Zurich: Christ.
Froschoverum, 1551—1587). (From the original in the
Special Collections of Northwestern University Library)
in the South Pacific Ocean. Its head was flat on
the surface of the water, and its body was coiled
up, while the tail hung down several fathoms
below the surface. It raised its head as they
passed within a yard of it, then slowly straight-
ened out and moved off.
Capt. J. F. Cox of the British ship Privateer
saw a Sea serpent like a huge eel “as black as coal
tar” in the North Atlantic 100 miles west of
Brest, France, on August 5, 1879.
On December 7, 1905, British naturalists E.

when they saw an animal 100 yards from the
boat. It appeared as a 7-8-foot head and neck
followed by a 6-foot-long, rubbery fin sticking 2
feet out of the water. The eye and neck had a
turtlelike appearance. It swung its neck back
and forth as it swam slowly along.
In the spring of 1912, the crew of the British
steamer Queen Eleanor watched an eel-like ani-
mal with a long neck and two humps in the
Mediterranean Sea off Akra Tamaron, the south-
ern tip of Greece. It was about 30 feet long and
had a speckled color. The chief engineer took a
shot at it with his rifle, and it disappeared.
Capt. P. de Haan and the crew of the steamer
Bawean , at sea off Brisbane, Queensland, Aus-
tralia, on July 25, 1925, saw a black Sea monster
about 25 feet long with an erect fin about 12
feet long behind its head. Though Heuvelmans
classes this as a Super-eel, it could just as well be
some sort of Beaked whale (Family Ziphiidae).
Possible explanations:
(1) Various types of giant, abyssal, eel-like
fishes. A major reason why Heuvelmans
considered giant eels a viable explanation
was because Anton Bruun, on the
oceanographic vessel Dana , in 1930
discovered an abyssal eel larva 6 feet long.
Known as a leptocephalus, the larva of the
Common eel (Anguilla anguilld) grows into
an adult about thirty times larger. If the
Dana leptocephalus were to grow at a
similar rate, it would become an adult
108-180 feet long. However, in 1970,
Miami ichthyologist David G. Smith
identified the Dana specimen as the larva of
a Spiny eel ( Notacanthus spp.), which does
not grow much larger than its larval stage.
(2) A giant form of Swamp eel (Family
Synbranchidae) was suggested by
Constantin Rafinesque in 1817. These eel-
like fishes live in freshwater and occasionally
brackish tropical water worldwide. They
have no pectoral or pelvic fins and only
rudimentary dorsal and anal fins; the caudal
fin is small or rudimentary or lacking
altogether; and the gill-membranes are
joined together under the throat. Most are
SUPER-EEL 529
primarily air-breathers. The largest is the
Obscure swamp eel ( Ophisternon
aenigmaticum) , a Central American species
that grows to more than 2 feet 7 inches.

Super-Otter
A category of Sea MONSTER identified by
Bernard Heuvelmans.
Scientific names: Hyperhydra egedei, given by
Heuvelmans in 1965; modified to Hyperhydra
norvegica by Lars Thomas in 1996.
Physical description: Elongated, otterlike shape
but may show six to seven bends. Length,
65—100 feet. Uniform light or grayish-brown.
Skin appears rough or wrinkled. Long head, flat
on top and tapering toward the snout. Small
eyes. Teeth often seen. Slender neck of medium
length. Two pairs of webbed feet with distinct
toes. Long tail that ends in a point.
Behavior: Seen in midsummer. Moves in close,
vertical undulations, with a spiral component.
Generates a wake that magnifies its actual length.
Habitat: Along the continental shelf.
Distribution: The Arctic Ocean off the north-
ern coast of Norway; occasionally in the Baltic
Sea and off western Greenland.
Significant sightings: The Protestant mission-
ary Hans Egede saw a huge animal with two
paws or flippers off Nuuk, western Greenland,
on July 6, 1734. Its body was as bulky as a ship
and three times longer (perhaps 100 feet). It
spouted like a whale and raised its tail out of the
water a ship’s length away from its head and
neck.
Around 1745, near Bergen, Hordaland
County, Norway, a huge animal creating a dis-
turbance in the water came close to a fishing
boat. It had a head like a seal’s, fur, and a
pointed tail 35 feet long.
Between 1818 and 1822, an animal with
large, vertical coils was seen many times off the
Norwegian coast in the summer. In July 1819,
it was seen nearly every day a short distance
from the shore by the inhabitants of two small
islands in Hordaland County. The bishop of
Nordland and Finmark saw two of these ani-
mals in Trondheimsfjorden.
In the 1830s, a large sea monster was seen fre-
quently off Kristiansund, More og Romsdal
County, Norway. The merchant John Johnson
said that it was blackish and about 55 feet long
and that it swam with an undulating motion. It
held its head only a slight distance above the
water.
Its last appearance may have been in Roms-
dalfjorden, Norway, around 1847.
Present status: Possibly extinct since the mid-
nineteenth century.
Possible explanation: An archaic whale more
primitive than the basilosaurids, with some ves-
tigial limbs, proposed by Heuvelmans. Karl
Shuker suggested that the ambulocetids — the
oldest marine whales, found in Pakistan in the
Eocene, 50-45 million years ago — might
match. They had four large legs used for swim-
ming, looked more like crocodiles than whales,
and lived offshore, although they apparently
swam into river estuaries to drink fresh water.

Surrey Puma
British Big Cat of southern England.
Etymology: A newspaper term coined in Au-
gust 1964 when a large cat was reported in the
Larnham and Odiham area on the Surrey-
Hampshire border.
Physical description: Pumalike big cat. Length,
3-6 feet. Shoulder height, 2 feet 6 inches-3 feet.
Gold, beige, reddish, or black in color. Large
paws. Tail, 2 feet 6 inches long.
Behavior: Usually nocturnal. Has a strong
odor of ammonia. Makes screaming or hissing
sounds. Dogs and foxes are terrified of it. Kills
both livestock and wild animals. Drags smaller
animals from field to field.
Tracks: Catlike but with claws. Length, 4-6
inches. Half an inch deep. Claw marks left on
tree trunks.
Distribution: Southeast England, with focal
points at Bushylease Larm, between Ewshot and
Crondall, Hampshire; Hurtwood Common,
near Guildford, Surrey.
Significant sightings: During the winter of
SURREY PUMA 531
Surrey puma photographed at Worplesdon, Surrey,
England, in August 1966 by Ian Pert. (Fortean Picture
Library)
1962-1963, a big cat made several nocturnal
visits to Bushylease Farm, near Crondall,
Hampshire.
On August 17, 1964, a milkman near Cron-
dall drove his minivan over a large cat, which
jumped over a hedge into a field.
Police took plaster casts of pawprints found
near Munstead, Surrey, on September 7, 1964,
left by an animal that ran across a long stretch of
sandy soil and jumped over a 5.5-foot fence.
This and various livestock killings in the county
led to a two-year Surrey puma hunt by police,
who logged 362 official sightings from Septem-
ber 1964 to August 1966.
Former police photographer Ian Pert snapped
a picture of a large cat by a house at Worples-
don, Surrey, in early August 1966, though it re-
sembles a feral domestic cat, not a puma.
Three children saw a tawny-brown, catlike
animal creeping through the grass on the edge
of the woods near Woodlands, Hampshire, in
September 1972.
Around July 1, 1976, Sally Rose was sur-
prised by a large cat that walked out of the
bushes onto a road south of Bracknell, Surrey,
and vanished into the woods on the other side.
Construction workers near Reigate, Surrey,
saw a large “lioness” several times in mid-Octo-
ber 1977, triggering a police search. One of the
men, Keith Livingston, took a photo from a
distance.

Tailed Slow Loris
Unknown PRIMATE of the Indian subcontinent.
Scientific name: Nycticebus caudatus sp. nov.,
given by Karl Shuker in 1993.
Physical description: Similar to the slow loris.
White coat. Woolly fur. Large, rounded head.
Flat face. Large eyes, encircled by a dark, trian-
gular patch. Short, roundish ears. Small muzzle.
Short, stout limbs. Narrow black stripe running
from the head down the back. Distinctively
long, bushy tail.
Distribution: Mizoram Union Territory, east-
ern India.
Significant sighting: Specimens were captured
alive near Lunglei, Mizoram, in December
1889, photographed, and exhibited.
Present status: May be extinct.
Possible explanations:
(1) A teratological aberration of the Slow
loris ( Nycticebus coucang).
(2) An unknown species or subspecies of
loris.

Tallegwi
GlANT Humanoid of the eastern and central
United States.
Etymology: Dakota (Siouan) word.
Variant names: Allegwi, Alligewi, Talligewi.
Physical description: Taller than the Indians.
Behavior: Built cities and large fortifications.
Distribution: Pennsylvania; Minnesota.
Significant sighting: After a bitter war with the
Delaware and Iroquois, the Tallegwi fled down
the Ohio River to the Mississippi River. In Min-
nesota, they encountered the Dakotas, who ex-
terminated them. Another tradition has their
last stand at the Falls of the Ohio, Kentucky.
Possible explanation: A memory of the
Hopewell people, who may have been chased
out of the Ohio Valley by Algonquian and
Siouan groups, perhaps around A.D. 500.

Taller Hominid
Term used by Mark A. Hall to distinguish a
shorter GlANT HOMINID from the NEO-GlANT
(Bigfoot), the Shorter Hominid, and the
True Giant. He includes in this category the
Tornit, Maricoxi, Kul, and Chuchunaa.
Physical description: Average height, 7 feet tall.
Tracks: Length, 10-14.5 inches. Width, 3-5
inches. Slightly curved. Toes splayed.
Distribution: North and South America;
Siberia.
534 TAH-TAH-KLE’-AH
Possible explanation: Hall assigns both Homo
sapiens rhodesiensis and Homo gardarensis to this
category. Rhodesiensis is the taxon assigned to
the Middle Pleistocene cranium found in the
1920s at the Broken Hill Mine near Kabwe,
Zambia. It is now more commonly designated
as an archaic Homo sapiens fossil; the postcranial
bones associated with it seem more modern
than Neanderthal remains. Gardarensis is based
on the 1920 discovery by F. C. C. Hansen of an
apparently Neanderthaloid cranium at the Gar-
dar Viking site in Igaliku, Greenland. However,
the remains are now universally considered to be
a medieval Norseman with acromegaly, a skull
deformity caused by a malfunctioning pituitary
gland. A femur associated with the Gardar skull
indicates a height greater than 6 feet. Hall
points out that the teeth do not show symptoms
of acromegaly and theorizes that the specimen is
a descendant of Homo ergaster, a hominid of ap-
proximately human size that lived 1.9- 1.5 mil-
lion years ago in East Africa.

Freshwater Monster of Australasia.
Etymology: Maori (Austronesian) word.
Variant names: Taneewha, Tanewa, Taniwa.
Physical description: Alligator-like. Covered
with scales or black down.
Behavior: Upsets canoes. Can also move
through the earth or air.
Habitat: Lakes, rivers, caves.
Distribution: Waikato and Whanganui
Rivers, North Island, New Zealand.

“tapir tiger.”
Physical description: Length, 6 feet. Shoulder
height, 4 feet. Dark-gray color. Enormous paws.
Behavior: Feeds on the South American tapir
( Tapirus terrestris).
Distribution: Sangay National Park, Ecuador.

Tarasque
DRAGON of medieval France.
Etymology: From the castle of Tarascon, on
the Rhone River. Alternatively, Tarascon (origi-
nally called Nerluc) is said to have taken its
name from the Dragon after it was killed.
Physical description: Size of an ox. Head like a
lion’s. Ears like a horse’s. Hard skin, covered
with spikes. Six legs. Bearlike claws. Serpentine
or scorpion-like tail.
Behavior: Amphibious. Sloughs its skin every
seven years. Said to have caused the river to
flood. Made itself a nuisance by eating people
and destroying bridges.
Habitat: An underwater cave near Tarascon.
Distribution: The Rhone River, between
Arles and Avignon, Provence, France. The ani-
mal is said to have come originally from Gala-
tia in central Turkey, which may indicate a
Celtic origin.
Significant sightings: St. Martha (a Syrian
prophetess conflated with Martha, the sister of
Lazarus) was said to have overcome Tarasque
with holy water and the sign of the cross.
There were reports of river monsters in the
Rhone in 1954 and 1955.
In June 1964, a long-necked Sea Monster
was seen by Jacques Borelli at the river’s mouth.
Present status: The city celebrates St. Martha’s
victory over Tarasque with a festival in late June
each year.
Possible explanations:
(1) A Nile crocodile ( Crocodylus niloticus ),
especially since St. Martha is associated with
the Middle East.
(2) An Aurochs {Bos primigenius) , though
this wild European bull was neither
amphibious nor particularly ferocious.
(3) Creationists have suggested that
Tarasque was the Late Cretaceous dinosaur
Triceratops, though the legend does not
mention horns on the head. Ceratopsian
dinosaurs are known only from North and
South America and Asia.
(4) A closer match would be a glyptodont, a
large armadillo-like mammal that lived in
South America until the end of the
Pleistocene, 10,000 years ago. One species
weighed nearly 2 tons. Glyptodonts had
armored horns on their heads; huge,
turtlelike shells made of bony hexagons
bound together by collagen; bones at the
base of the tail; and stiff, bony sheaths at
the tip.
(5) The theropod dinosaur Tarascosaurus
salluvicus, a femur of which was discovered
near Tarascon at Lambeau du Beausset in
1991, was named after Tarasque.

Tasmanian Devil (Mainland)
Large, carnivorous MARSUPIAL of Australia, now
confined to Tasmania and presumed extinct on
the mainland since the fourteenth century.
Scientific name: Sarcophilus harrisii , given by
Pierre Boitard in 1841.
Physical description: Size of a small dog. Black,
with white chest patches.
Behavior: Emits a spine-chilling screech.
Distribution: Victoria; New South Wales;
Western Australia.
Significant sightings: “Cambrian” recorded the
presence of Tasmanian devils in New South
Wales, Victoria, and South Australia during the
first part of the nineteenth century. A colony of
the animals was said to be living around Lake
Albert, New South Wales, in 1896.
In 1912, a live Tasmanian devil was captured
at Toobarac, Victoria. The animal’s skin and
skeleton were preserved in the National Mu-
seum of Victoria.
Another Tasmanian devil was found in west-
ern Victoria in 1971.
In 1991, two Tasmanian devils were discov-
ered as roadkills, one near Bendigo, Victoria,
and the other 95 miles away. The specimens
were preserved by the Mammalogy Department
of the Museum of Melbourne. In 1997, a fe-
male Tasmanian devil was found underneath a
car in a parking lot at Balga, Western Australia,
and taken to the Perth Zoo.
Present status: Tasmanian devils formerly
ranged over much of eastern Australia, but most
zoologists believe they disappeared before Euro-
pean settlement, probably ousted by Dingos
( Canis familiaris var. dingo ) .
Possible explanation: Escapees from smugglers
bringing animals illegally into other states from
Tasmania.

wurm, Springwurm (in Tirol, Austria, “jump-
ing worm”), Stollenwurm, Stollwurm (in the
Bernese Alps of Switzerland, “hole worm”),
Tazzelwurm.

back, lighter underneath. Blunt head, some-
times described as catlike. Large eyes with a
piercing glance. Wide mouth with sharp teeth.
Forked tongue. Indistinct neck. Most reports
give it two short, stubby front feet with three
toes that point outward; others mention four
legs or none at all. Short, thick tail.
Behavior: Active in stormy weather. Can
jump several feet. Hisses, whistles, or snorts. Hi-
bernates in the winter. Sometimes sleeps in hay
in farm buildings. Basks in the sun. Allegedly
venomous. Said to attack cattle. Aggressive.
May attack if disturbed.
Habitat: Mountains and rocky areas at alti-
tudes from 1,600 to 7,200 feet.
Distribution: The Swiss, Bavarian, French,
Italian, and Austrian Alps, with some reports
from Silesia in Poland.
TATZELWURM 537
Significant sightings: Hans Fuchs suffered a
heart attack and died when he ran across two
Tatzelwurms in 1779 near Unken, Salzburg,
Austria.
Kaspar Arnold saw a Tatzelwurm on the
Spielberg, near Hochfilzen, Tirol, Austria, in
July 1883 or 1884. He watched it from a moun-
tain restaurant for twenty minutes and was cer-
tain it only had two legs.
A two-legged Tatzelwurm leaped 9 feet in the
air toward two witnesses near Rauris, Salzburg,
Austria, in the summer of 1921. It was gray,
about 2-3 feet long, and had a head like a cat.
In 1934, a Swiss photographer named Balkin
claimed to have photographed a Tatzelwurm
near Meiringen, Switzerland, but his photo was
probably a faked image of a ceramic fish.
In the summer of 1969, a local man reported
a 30-inch-long animal with two hind legs near
Lengstein, Trentino-Alto Adige, Italy. It seemed
to be inflating its neck.
In 1990, two naturalists found the skeleton of
a lizardlike animal in the Alps near Domodos-
sola, Italy. Giuseppe Costale saw a gray, crested
reptile moving in a zigzag fashion on Pizzo Cro-
nia in the same area on two occasions, in Octo-
ber 1991 and September 1992.
Present status: Early knowledge of the Tatzel-
wurm may have contributed to European
DRAGON lore. There have been few reports since
the 1960s.
Possible explanations:
(1) Snakes, especially in those few reports in
which no front feet are reported.
(2) Reports of Tatzelwurms with four legs
might be misidentifications of Pearl lizards
(. Lucertola ocellata ), Alpine salamanders
(. Salamandra atra :), Otters ( Lutra lutra ), Pine
martens (. Martes mart eh, or Badgers (. Meles
meles ) .
(3) An unknown species of Anguid lizard
(Family Anguidae) related to the limbless
Blindworm ( Anguis fragilis) and the
European glass lizard ( Ophisaurus apodus ),
suggested by Robert Kirch.
(4) An unknown European species of
amphisbaenid lizard related to the two-
legged Mole worms (Family Bipedidae) of
Mexico and Baja California.
(5) An unknown European species of
Venomous lizard (Family Helodermatidae),
proposed by Jakob Nicolussi, although
members of this North American family
have two pairs of legs and are by definition
poisonous. There are no known instances of
Tatzelwurm poisoning.
(6) An unknown species of skink related to
the Three- toed skink ( Chalcides chalcides) of
Spain and the French Alps.
(7) An unknown European species of
salamander related to the Chinese giant
salamander ( Andrias davidianuh , which can
grow to more than 6 feet in length,
suggested by Ulrich Magin.

Teggie
Freshwater Monster of Wales.
Etymology: After Llyn Tegid, the Welsh name
for Bala Lake.
Variant name: Anghenfil.
Physical description: Length, 8-12 feet. Dark-
gray skin. Large head. Big eyes. Long neck.
Humped back.
Distribution: Bala Lake, Gwynedd, Wales.
Significant sightings: Former lake warden
Dafydd Bowen got a glimpse of Teggie in 1975.
In early March 1995, Andrew and Paul De-
laney were fishing when an animal came to
within 80 yards of their boat. It raised a small
head and 1 0-foot neck into the air.
Nick Taylor captured some footage of Teggie
in 1997. The video shows a moving, pale-green
head and hump.
Possible explanation: Live seals were used in
the lake during World War I for submarine-
detection training. Some may have persisted.

Teh-Lma
Small Hominid of Central Asia.
Etymology: Sherpa (Sino-Tibetan) compound
word of uncertain meaning.
Variant names: Pyar-them, Thelma.
Physical description: Height, 4-5 feet. Cov-
ered with thick, reddish-gray hair. Pointed
head. Sloping forehead. Slight mane. Hunched
shoulders.
Behavior: Walks and runs on its hind legs.
Makes a hooting noise. Eats frogs and insects.
Pulls twigs and leaves into neat bundles on the
forest floor.
Tracks: Length, 5 inches.
Habitat: Forests below the snow line.
Distribution: Eastern Nepal; Bhutan; south-
eastern Tibet; Sikkim State, India.
Significant sightings: Members of the 1958
TEH-LMA 539
Slick-Johnson Snowman Expedition encoun-
tered tracks of a Teh-Lma in northeastern
Nepal. Gerald Russell came across some small
tracks at an altitude of 8,500 feet near Bumling.
Hearing from a local man in April that a small
Yeti was making nightly visits to a stream near
Walung in the Chhoyang River valley, Sherpa
Da Temba went to stake out the area. He found
a wet footprint, then, using a flashlight, he saw
the creature about 30 yards away. Peter and
Bryan Byrne found a set of humanlike foot-
prints near a half-eaten frog later in the spring.
In 1959, the Byrne brothers found some
droppings that apparently were from a Teh-
Lma. A. Fain of the Antwerp Tropical Medicine
Institute analyzed them and found an intestinal
nematode of the genus Trichuris but could not
determine the species. Another sample was ana-
lyzed by Anne Porter at the Zoological Society
of London, who found some mammalian hairs
and invertebrate tissue.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Assam macaque ( Macaca assamensis)
and Rhesus monkey (M. mulatto) are found
at moderate elevations in northern India
and Nepal. Both are quadrupedal and about
2 feet long with a 12-inch tail.
(2) The Sloth bear (Melursus ursinus) is
about 4-5 feet long and has a glossy black
coat with a distinct U- or V-shaped white
mark on its chest. It eats insects, honey,
carrion, fruit, flowers, and sugarcane.
(3) The Hoolock gibbon ( Hylobates hoolock )
is a little less than 3 feet tall when standing
erect and has distinctive white brows. It is
found in lowland forest east of the
Brahmaputra River.

Tengu
Mythical LLYING HUMANOID of Japan.
Etymology: Japanese, “heavenly dog,” from
the Chinese Tien-kou (“celestial dog”), which
may have referred to meteors or other astro-
nomical events.
Physical description: Human body, arms, and
legs. Glittering eyes. Large beak. Long wings,
sometimes described as “shimmering” like a
hummingbird’s. The more ancient type ( karasu
tengu, or “crow tengu”) was half bird and half
human, while its more recent manifestation
( konoha or yamabushi tengu, “mountain priest
tengu”) is completely human, with a long nose.
Behavior: Said to be able to disappear from
one location and appear in another, rather than
fly from place to place. Born from giant eggs.
Can disguise itself as a Golden eagle ( Aquila
chrysaetos) or as a human. Said to kidnap chil-
dren and carry them away, though it returns
them to the normal world and bestows them
with supernatural powers. Wears a cap that dou-
540 TEMU

Tennessee Pygmy
SMALL Hominid of North America.
Physical description: Height, 3 feet.
Distribution: Sparta, Tennessee.
Significant sightings: In the early nineteenth
century, a burial site containing the skeletons of
people of apparently very short stature was
found near Sparta, Tennessee. The graves were
2 feet long, 14 inches wide, and 18 inches deep.
One skeleton was said to be 2 feet 1 0 inches in
length.
Possible explanation: The bones were either of
children or of disarticulated adults.

Thai Mammoth
Mystery ELEPHANT of Southeast Asia.
Physical description: Elephant with long hair
on its back and around the tusks.
Distribution: Northwestern Thailand.
Significant sighting: Thai princess Rangsrino-
padorn Yukol took some blurry aerial photo-
graphs of a herd of twenty-eight elephants in the
Omkoi District of northwestern Thailand dur-
ing a forestry survey by helicopter in 1984. She
characterized the animals as surviving mam-
moths.
Present status: An expedition announced by
the princess in December 2000 was called off at
the request of the Royal Forestry Department,
for security reasons.
Possible explanation: A normal Asian elephant
(Elephas maximus) that retains a large portion of
juvenile hair, a condition that sometimes occurs
in the northern part of the elephant’s range.

Track of the Sasquatch,” Northwest Anthropolog-
ical Research Notes 6 (Spring 1972): 65-90.
Thanacth
Unknown PRIMATE of the Indian subcontinent.
Variant names: Tanacht.
Physical description: Size and shape of a tiger.
Covered in tawny fur. Head-hair, blackish and
frizzled. Face like a human’s. Snub nose. Hu-
manlike hands. Hind feet are like a tiger’s. No
tail.
Significant sighting: Some Indians from Ben-
gal took this animal to the Red Sea as a curios-
ity, where Andre Thevet saw it in the sixteenth
century.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Slow loris fNycticebus coucang) has
only a stub of a tail, and its face looks
humanlike. It lives in the rain forests of
THANACTH 541
northeast India. However, it’s only about 1 5
inches long.
(2) A large lemur from Madagascar, such as
the Indri ( Indri indri) or the as yet
unknown T RATRATRATRA.

The Thing
Giant INVERTEBRATE of the Caribbean Sea.
Physical description: Wormlike. Segmented.
Length, 7-15 feet. Diameter, 1.5-2 inches.
Color, maroon or copper, with fluorescent,
multicolored speckles. Bulbous head, described
as walruslike. Feathered gills. Hundreds of leg-
like protuberances or setae along the sides.
Behavior: Nocturnal. Extremely sensitive to
light. Tends to break apart when handled. Eaten
by moray eels.
Habitat: Coral reef.
Distribution: Anse Chastanet dive resort,
Soufriere, St. Lucia.
Significant sighting: Felix Voirol saw the
Thing during a night dive in the summer of
1993. It was as big as a medium-sized moray eel,
copper-colored, and segmented. It instantly dis-
appeared into a crevice.
Present status: Photographs exist of the ani-
mal, but they have not been published.
Possible explanations:
(1) A hoax on the part of the dive resort is
unlikely, since it would be difficult to set up
and maintain.
(2) A giant, segmented, unknown species of
polychaete worm, suggested by Michael
Allard and Susan Marsden. Rock worms
(Family Eunicidae) are omnivorous
polychaetes that live in coral reefs. Some
species grow to more than 6 feet long.
(3) Outsize individual worms of known
eunicid species.

Three-Starred Anglerfish
One of Beebe’s Abyssal Fishes of the North
Atlantic Ocean.
Scientific name: Bathyceratias trilynchus, given
by William Beebe.
Physical description: Oval anglerfish. Length,
6 inches. Black. Three “fishing rod” antennae
(illicia) on the head tipped with a pale-yellow
light organ. Small eyes.
Significant sighting: Observed only once at
2,470 feet by William Beebe in a bathysphere
off Bermuda in the early 1930s.
Distribution: North Atlantic Ocean.
Possible explanation: Unknown species allied
to the Angler fishes (Family Ceratiidae).
Source: William Beebe, Half Mile Down
(New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1934).
Three-Toes
Dubious Freshwater Monster or Sea Mon-
ster of Florida.
Etymology: From its tracks.
Variant name: Old three- toes.
Physical description: Length, 1 5 feet. Hairy or
furred. Gray or dirty-yellow color. Blunt head
like an alligator’s or rhinoceros’s. No neck.
Front flippers hang from its shoulders. Back legs
like an alligator’s but heavier. Huge, three-toed
feet. Long, blunt tail.
Behavior: Amphibious. Bipedal; runs or wad-
dles. Churns up foam when swimming. Makes
a gurgling growl.
Tracks: Three clawed toes. Length, 13.5
inches, from middle toe tip to heel. Width, 15
inches. Stride, 2 feet 7 inches.
Distribution: Clearwater-Tampa area and
Suwannee River, Florida.
Significant sightings: The first incident took
place in February 1948 when a young Clearwa-
ter, Florida, couple on a beach road early in the
morning reported to police they had seen some
kind of monster stomp out of the sea. Tracks
were discovered soon afterward coming out of
the water, wandering on the beach, then return-
ing to the sea. Other track discoveries were
made in the Clearwater-Tampa area in March
and April.
On July 25, 1948, fliers George Orfanides
542 THE THING
and John Milner saw a 15-foot animal swim-
ming about 200 feet off the shore of Hog Island
near Dunedin, Florida.
A couple from Milwaukee saw a huge, furry
something with a rhinoceros’s head waddling
down the beach into shallow water north of
Tarpon Springs, Florida, in August 1948.
On October 21, 1948, a set of about 240
similar tracks was found near Old Town in
north Florida, coming out of the Suwannee
River.
In November 1948, Ivan T. Sanderson was
flying above the Suwannee River south of Old
Town when he and his pilot saw a large, yel-
lowish animal rolling on the surface of the
water, creating a large patch of foam.
Possible explanations:
(1) An unknown species of giant penguin,
1 5 feet tall, suggested by Ivan T. Sanderson
and based on its tracks.
(2) A hoax by Tony Signorini and A1
Williams, who strapped on huge, cast-iron,
three-toed feet to create the footprints at
both locations in Florida.

Thunder Horse
Legendary horselike HOOFED MAMMAL of the
north-central United States.
Etymology: Translation of a Siouan word.
Physical description: Large and horselike.
Behavior: Thunder is generated by its hooves
as it jumps to the ground during storms. Kills
bison.
Distribution: Nebraska; South Dakota.
Possible explanation: Probably based on
knowledge of fossilized skeletons of such
megafauna as the titanotheres — elephant-sized
herbivores with huge, blunt horns on their
snouts — that died out some 34 million years
ago. Othniel C. Marsh’s naming of the rhinoc-
eros-like North American fossil Brontotherium
was inspired by Thunder horse legends.

Thunderbird
Legendary giant Bird of North America. See
<2/50 Thunderbird (Pennsylvania).
Etymology: From the thunderous flapping of
its wings or possibly from its northern migra-
tion to the Pacific Northwest in the spring or
rainy season.
Variant names: Achiyalabopa (Pueblo), Alkun-
tam (Bella Coola/Salishan), Animikii (Ojibwa/
Algonquian), Ba’a (Comanche/Uto-Aztecan), Big
Bird, Binesi or Pinesi (Ojibwa/ Algonquian),

git/Na-Dene), Kwunusela (Kwakiutl/ Wakashan),
Mechquan (Ossippee), Met’co (Montagnais/
Algonquian), Nunyenunc (Shoshoni/Uto-

Pach-an-a-ho (Yakima/Penutian), PlASA, Pilhan-
naw (Ossippee), Sanuwa or Tlanuwa (Cherokee/
Iroquoian), Tse’na’hale (Navajo/Na-Dene), Yel-
lo-kin (Miwok/Penutian).
Physical description: White ruff. Bald head.
Wingspan, 9-70 feet, with most reports agree-
ing on 10-18 feet.
Behavior: Said to cause thunder by flapping
its wings. Feeds on live mammals and carrion.
On the West Coast, said to attack and carry off
whales. Nests on high cliffs. Generally benevo-
lent toward humans but sometimes carries them
off to its nest in its talons.
Distribution: Throughout North America but
with specific legends at Mount Edgecumbe,
Alaska; Tombstone, Arizona; Alpena, Michigan;
THUNDERBIRD 543
Inuit spear rest from Cape Prince of Wales, Alaska,
showing Thunderbirds catching whales. From Edward
William Nelson, “ The Eskimo about Bering Strait, ”
Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology,
vol. 18, pt. 1 (1896-1897). (From the original in the
Northwestern University Library)
Whiteside Mountain, North Carolina; Blount
County, Tennessee; Thunder Mountain, Wis-
consin; and southern Alberta, Canada. To a lesser
extent, the West Indies and South America.
Significant sightings: Thunderbirds are often
depicted in rock art with outstretched wings,
feathers prominent, and zigzag lines represent-
ing lightning.
An atypical Thunderbird pictograph is found
in Black Dragon Canyon, 15 miles west of
Green River, Utah. Painted by an artist of the
Fremont culture (a.D. 900-1100) using a dark-
red pigment, the bird is 7 feet long from wingtip
to wingtip and has a crest, batlike wings, and a
tail.
Claude Schaeffer recorded several accounts of
Blackfoot Indians seeing Thunderbirds in Al-
berta and Montana in the nineteenth century.
In 1879, the daughter of Red Paint, Mary Jane,
and her white husband saw four huge birds at
Chief Mountain, Glacier National Park, Mon-
tana. In 1 897, Big Crow and his wife saw a large
bird with a feathered ruff and bald head on the
southern section of the Blackfoot Reservation.
The most recent sighting was in 1908.
Many cryptozoologists have memories of see-
ing a photograph of a Thunderbird being held
up against a barn by some 1880s-era cowboys. It
was said to have appeared in an Old West or
men’s magazine of the 1960s, but to date, no
one has turned it up. Karl Shuker thinks that in
some cases, people may be misremembering an
old photo of a Marabou stork ( Leptoptilos cru -
meniferus) held with its wings outstretched by
three Africans. Mark Chorvinsky has found that
a dubious account of a huge, winged monster
shot by two ranchers in the Huachuca Moun-
tains of Arizona did appear in the Tombstone
(Ariz.) Epitaph for April 26, 1890, but with no
accompanying photo. He also thinks the origi-
nal source for the Thunderbird photo story was
Hiram Cranmer of Hammersley Fork, Pennsyl-
vania, who also claimed to have seen a Pennsyl-
vania Thunderbird (see entry below) in 1922.
Possible explanations:
(1) The California condor ( Gymnogyps
californianus) is the largest U.S. vulture,
reaching a length of 4 feet, a wingspan of 9
feet 4 inches, and a weight of 20-25
pounds. It is black, with white wing linings,
and has a naked, red-orange head that
changes color with its mood. In 1987, the
few remaining wild birds were caught for a
captive breeding program; reintroduction
began in 1992 in remote sites of Los Padres
National Forest, California. Fossil remains
of this bird have been found in New York
and Florida, as well as Arizona and New
Mexico in the Pleistocene. There is evidence
that these condors returned to the
Southwest as early as the 1700s in response
to the introduction of large herds of cattle,
horses, and sheep that replaced the extinct
Pleistocene megafauna as a source of
carrion.
(2) A surviving teratorn, a member of a
family of predatory fossil vultures that
resembled reptiles in some ways. Their jaws
were designed to swallow living prey, but
their talons were not capable of seizing
things. They probably used their sharp,
hooked beaks to catch animals. The largest
known flying bird, Argentavis magnificens,
weighed 158 pounds, stood 5-6 feet tall,
and had a wingspan of 23-25 feet. It lived
in Argentina in the Late Miocene, 8—5
million years ago. In North America,
544 THUNDERBIRD
Teratornis merriami weighed about 36
pounds and had an 11 foot 6 inch-12 foot
6 inch wingspan; T. incredibilis of Nevada
and California lived in the Pleistocene and
had a wingspan of 17-19 feet.

Thunderbird (Pennsylvania)
Giant Bird of Pennsylvania.
Scientific names: Gymnogyps pennsylvanianus ,
suggested by Hiram Cranmer; Mythopoeia ti-
tanornis, offered by Gerald Musinsky in 1997.
Variant name: Eastern condor.
Physical description: Eaglelike bird. Length,
3-4 feet. Wingspan, 14-30 feet. Often de-
scribed as the size of a Piper Cub airplane. Black
or brown, becoming grayer with age. Large,
black eyes. Large beak, not hooked. Short neck.
Wings, about 12 inches wide. Short, thick legs.
Behavior: Possibly migratory, traveling south
in November through the Appalachians to West
Virginia and north in March to upstate New
THUNDERBIRD (PENNSYLVANIA) 545
York. Flaps wings slowly. Flies easily through
dense woodland. Feeds on carrion. Said to prey
on humans by seizing them by the shoulders and
carrying them to remote mountaintops to feed.
Distribution: Central and western Pennsylva-
nia, especially the Sproul State Forest in Clinton
County. Sightings have been reported from Bear
Run, Beaver Falls, Centerville, Clinton County,
Coudersport, Dents Run, Erie, Greenville,
Hammersley Fork, Hughesville, Hyner, Jersey
Shore, Lock Haven, Lycoming County, south-
ern McKean County, Murrysville, Ole Bull,
Renovo, Shingletown, South Greensburg, and
Sunderlinville. Also Chateaugay, New York.
Significant sightings: The earliest account
comes from Elvira Ellis Coats of northern Potter
County, who learned about Pennsylvania Thun-
derbirds in the 1840s from the local Indians.
Around 1940, Robert R. Lyman saw a giant,
brownish bird standing in the middle of Shel-
don Road, 2 miles north of Coudersport. It flew
away when he got to within 150 feet, showing
off a wingspan of 20-25 feet and navigating
through second-growth trees with ease.
Hiram M. Cranmer watched a giant bird fly-
ing at a height of 500 feet around Renovo on
March 27, 1957. It was grayish and had a
wingspan of 25-30 feet. Sightings continued in
the area for about three weeks.
On March 31, 1973, Joseph and Wanda
Kaye were driving near the Oregon Hill Ski
Area in Lycoming County when they saw a
large, black bird by the side of the road. Its
wings flapped slowly as they went past, and it
flew into the air.
Two school teachers, Debbie Wright and Sue
Howell, saw a huge bird in the spring of 1977
while driving to Du Bois near Drocker’s
Woods. It was very dark, with a huge beak.
In July 1993, Shane Fisher and his mother
and father saw a huge, eaglelike bird near Larry’s
Creek.
On July 6, 2000, Robin Swope watched a
dark-gray bird with a 15-17-foot wingspan fly
over the Erie County Memorial Gardens near
Erie, Pennsylvania.
An amateur birder of Greenville, Pennsylva-
nia, saw a bird the size of a small airplane on
June 13, 2001. It flew in from the south and
landed on a tree 300 yards from the house,
where it stayed for fifteen to twenty minutes. It
had dark-brown or black feathers with grayish-
black wings and was about 5 feet long, with a
15-foot wingspan.
Mike Felice saw a huge, black bird with a
wingspan of 10-15 feet in South Greensburg,
Pennsylvania, on September 25, 2001. It was
slowly flying about 50-60 feet above Route
119, apparently following some trucks, and
briefly landed on a large tree. He had it in sight
for a minute and a half, but there were appar-
ently no other witnesses.
Possible explanations:
(1) A California condor ( Gymnogyps
californianus) — the largest U.S. vulture —
which reaches a length of 4 feet and a
wingspan of 9 feet 4 inches. It is black, with
white wing linings, and has a naked, red-
orange head. An endangered species in
California, a condor population may have
persisted in Pennsylvania since the
Pleistocene. Fossil remains of this bird have
been found in New York and Florida.
(2) An unknown species of condor endemic
to Pennsylvania.

Thylacine
Doglike MARSUPIAL of Australia, presumed ex-
tinct since 1936.
Etymology: From the Greek thylakos (“leather
pouch”).
Scientific name: Thylacinus cynocephalus, given
by C. J. Temminck in 1824.
Variant names: Dobsegna, Marsupial wolf,
Nannup tiger (in Western Australia), Ozenkad-
nook tiger (in Victoria), Tasmanian tiger, Tassie
tiger, WALDAGI, Wonthaggi monster (in Victo-
ria).
Physical description: Large, doglike marsupial.
Shoulder height, 2 feet. Length, about 3 feet 6
inches-4 feet 6 inches. Weight, 65-75 pounds.
Head large in proportion to the body. The face
is gray, with white markings around the eyes.
Ears, short and rounded. Its huge jaws open to
an angle of nearly 90 degrees. Has thirteen to
nineteen vertical, brown-black stripes on its
back, rump, and tail. Yellow-brown to grayish-
brown in color. A few reports, particularly from
Western Australia, refer to animals that either
lack stripes or are all black. Short legs. Tail is
stiff and 2 feet long, and it tapers to a point.
Behavior: Nocturnal but has been seen to
bask in the sun. Quiet and secretive. Its usual
gait is a graceful lope. Some witnesses claim it is
capable of rearing on its hind legs and hopping
like a kangaroo when threatened. Usually mute
but produces a terrier-like double yap when
hunting, a deep growl when irritated, and a
whine. Feeds on wallabies, small animals, and
birds. It was thought to kill livestock, but this
was never substantiated.
Tracks: Four toes pointing outward, with
claws showing. Sometimes, the impression of
Head of the Thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus).
(Drawing by Jack Rabbit © 2001)
the fifth toe on the front feet is visible. The
plantar pad is longer and wider and the side toes
are less set back than a dog’s. Trail goes in a
straight line, unlike a wombat’s, which shuffles
from side to side.
Habitat: Eucalyptus forests, wetlands, and
grasslands.
Distribution: The greatest concentration of
Tasmanian reports are in the northeast of the is-
land, near Mount William and Mount Barrow.
On the mainland, favored areas are the Darling
Range in southwest Western Australia, South
Australia from Murray Bridge to Mount Gam-
bier, and southeastern Victoria from Lang Lang
to Lake Victoria.
Significant sightings: In Tasmania — In May
1937, Ray Marthick found tracks and briefly
saw a group of Thylacines at dusk.
A. L. Fleming and Lesley Williams ran across
tracks in western Tasmania in 1937 and 1938.
David Fleay collected some firsthand stories
and found tracks on Franklin Hill and Poverty
Plain in 1945.
Bushmen B. Thorpe and A. Woolley watched
a Thylacine chase a wallaby near the Denison
River in southwest Tasmania in December
1947. The gray, striped animal passed within 20
yards of them.
In January 1958, tracks were found in mud
between Point Davey and Muydena.
Steven Smith documented 315 Thylacine
sightings in Tasmania between 1936 and 1980,
THYLACINE 547
Thylacine with young. (© 2002 ArtToday.com, Inc., an IMSI Company )
of which he categorized 103 as “good.” One of
the best sightings took place near the headwaters
of the Salmon River in the early morning of
March 9, 1982, when naturalist Hans Naarding
watched an adult Thylacine for three minutes in
the pouring rain from the back of his Land-
cruiser. The animal ran off when he moved for
his camera. He could find no tracks, but the an-
imal left a strong, musky scent behind.
In 1986, Turk Porteous saw a blue-gray fe-
male Thylacine with sixteen well-defined stripes
at Arthur River in northwestern Tasmania. He
followed its tracks and found the prints of two
juveniles. As a boy in the 1920s, he had often
seen Thylacine tracks.
On mainland Australia — Tony Healy and
Paul Cropper estimate there have been about
500 thylacine sightings on the mainland prior to
1994.
Southeastern South Australia produced a
flood of reports in 1967 and 1968, most of
them conforming to the animal’s description
and behavior. Barbara Adams and her four chil-
dren watched two Thylacine pups at play near
Frances on November 1, 1974; they were about
a foot high and sandy-colored, with dark mark-
ings on the flanks. Numerous sightings also oc-
curred to the southeast on Cape Nelson, Victo-
ria, in the early 1970s.
A striped creature has often been reported in
the area around Wonthaggi, southern Victoria.
The name “Wonthaggi monster” was invented
in 1955 by local journalists when an unusual
number of sheep were killed by an unknown
predator and people began seeing a Thylacine-
like animal. Rose Bristow watched a striped,
doglike animal at a range of only 30 feet near
Woolmai in March 1987.
Doglike animals have been reported in the
Victoria-South Australia border area, especially
from 1962 to 1965. The sightings centered on a
swampy area near Ozenkadnook, in Victoria’s
Wimmera District. A photograph taken by Rilla
Martin near Goroke, Victoria, in 1964 shows a
striped animal partially hidden by vegetation.
The stripes seem to cover its neck and shoulders,
which is uncharacteristic, but in general, it looks
much like a Thylacine.
Western Australia south of Perth has also
been a focal point for Thylacine reports. In this
548 THYLACINE
Photograph taken by Rilla Martin near Goroke, Victoria , , in 1964, of what may be a surviving Thylacine on the
Australian mainland. (Fortean Picture Library)
area, the animals are said to be responsible for
killing sheep and kangaroos by tearing their heads
off. A striped, doglike animal, possibly a Thy-
lacine, was reported in the early 1970s in the
forested Nannup District. One incident in No-
vember 1972 involved Freda and Joe Carmody,
who saw a large creature leap across the road in
front of their car; they were convinced it was a
Thylacine. On January 13, 1984, Kevin Cameron
snapped six photos of a Thylacine sitting on a log
about 30 feet away from him somewhere near
Yoongarillup; unfortunately, significant inconsis-
tencies were found in his testimony, and frames
were shown to be missing from the film.
In the spring of 1995, dentist Lance Mesh
and his daughter saw an apparent Thylacine
while driving along the southern slopes of the
Buderim rain forest in Queensland. At least fif-
teen sightings were reported in the state in the
late 1980s and early 1990s.
In New Guinea — See Dobsegna.
Present status : Thylacines are thought to have
become extinct on the Australian mainland
sometime between 1000 B.C. and 1788 when
Capt. James Cook arrived. They disappeared
largely due to competition with dingos, which
were introduced some 8,000 years ago. A thriv-
ing population persisted in Tasmania until
sheep farming was introduced in 1824 and the
animal was deemed a pest and vigorously exter-
minated. The last known Thylacine died in the
Beaumaris Zoo in Hobart, Tasmania, on Sep-
tember 7, 1936. According to Robert Paddle,
the tradition that it was a male named Benjamin
is wrong on both counts.
Several organized searches for the animal have
been undertaken in Tasmania — most notably
by David Fleay in 1945, Eric Guiler in 1959
and 1963, Jeremy Griffith in 1968, Steven
Smith in 1980, and Nick Mooney in 1982 —
THYLACINE 549
but all apparently failed to find conclusive evi-
dence of its continued existence. However, new
Thylacine reports surface every year, and many
scientists think it’s only a matter of time before
a living specimen is obtained.
The Australian Museum has a small Thy-
lacine pup preserved in alcohol since 1866. In
May 2000, the museum announced it had ex-
tracted DNA from the specimen and, opening a
debate on whether the animal should be cloned,
speculated that with genetic technology advanc-
ing rapidly, the Tasmanian tiger could be resur-
rected within ten years.
Possible explanations:
(1) Wombat (Family Vombatidae) tracks
can be mistaken for Thylacine tracks under
poor conditions. The tracks of Tasmanian
devils ( Sarcophilus harrisii ) might also pass
for Thylacine prints.
(2) Misidentifications of dingos or feral
Domestic dogs ( Canis familiaris) have
probably occurred.
(3) One problem with accepting mainland
Thylacine reports is the almost complete
lack of Aboriginal traditions about them.
However, Thylacines could have been
brought from Tasmania and released
sometime before 1936, when the animals
became extinct.

Tigelboat
Unknown tapirlike HOOFED MAMMAL of
Southeast Asia.
Etymology: A portmanteau word derived from
tiger, lion, bird, and goat.
Physical description: Said to have a body like a
tiger’s (stripes?), a neck like a lion’s (a mane?),
an elephant-like trunk, ears like a cow’s, a beard
and legs like a goat’s, and claws like a chicken’s
(hooves?).
Distribution: Borneo, Indonesia.
Significant sighting: An animal of this descrip-
tion was captured in November 1975 and kept
alive for a short time in a prison at Tenggarong,
Kalimantan Timur Province, Indonesia.
Possible explanation: A juvenile Malayan tapir
( Tapirus indicus) is striped and has an elongated
snout. Though tapirs supposedly died out in
Borneo 10,000 years ago, Karl Shuker points out
that there have been scattered, unconfirmed re-
ports of this species on the island over the years.
Short of a hoax, this explanation makes more
sense than the existence of an impossible hybrid.

Tigre de Montagne
Mystery Cat of West and Central Africa.
Etymology: French, “mountain tiger.”
Variant names: Coq-djinge (Yulu/Nilo-
Saharan, “mountain tiger”), Coq-ninji, GASSIN-
GRAM, HADJEL, WANJILANKO.
Physical description: Larger than a lion. Red
fur with white stripes, though a black variety is
also known. Protruding teeth. Long hair on its
paws. Tailless.
Behavior: Roars. Can carry away large an-
telopes.
Tracks: Long hair on the legs and paws eradi-
cates its tracks.
Habitat: Mountains and caves.
Distribution: Ennedi and other mountainous
areas of Chad; the Massif des Bongos, Central
African Republic; Casamance Forest, Senegal.
Significant sighting: In the 1960s and 1970s,
hunter Christian Le Noel heard stories about a
big, striped cat with protruding teeth in the
Ennedi Mountains, Chad. On one occasion, Le
Noel heard a terrific roar in a cavern that his
tracker identified as coming from a Coq-djinge.
Possible explanation: Surviving Mach air odus, a
genus of saber-toothed cat that lived in Africa
from the Miocene to the Pleistocene, 1 5-2 mil-
lion years ago. Some species were as large as
lions, but most had tigerlike proportions.

Tinicum Cat
Unknown small Cat of Pennsylvania.
Etymology: After the township where one was
killed in 1922.
Variant names: Indian devil, Nockamixon
cat, Timber cat, Woods cat.
Physical description: Bobcatlike felid. Total
length, 30 inches. Shoulder height, 13 inches.
Weight, 8.5 pounds. Sandy-gray coat, with
some yellow or buff color mixed in. A dark
streak extends from the shoulders along the
spine to the end of the tail. Tigerlike stripes on
the body, legs, and tail. Fluffy winter coat. Said
to be noticeably different from a feral domestic
cat. Round head. Flat ears. Broad gray face, 7
inches across the ears. Regular black lines on the
face. Strong teeth. Stiff, white whiskers. Con-
spicuous white spot on the throat. Front legs, 17
inches long. Hind legs, 13 inches. Thick, ringed
tail, 10-11 inches long, with a black tip.
Behavior: Fights fiercely when cornered.
Habitat: Rocky, wooded hills.
Distribution: Bucks and Fayette Counties,
Pennsylvania. Also possibly in southern Illinois.
Significant sightings: Hunters in the early
nineteenth century said these cats were plentiful
when the first settlers moved in but had become
much rarer in the intervening years. Three spec-
imens were caught in Irish Gap, Pennsylvania,
in 1857 and 1858 by C. H. Shearer.
A pair of strange wildcats had apparently been
uttering terrifying screams at night for three
years. On January 16, 1922, after tracking them
for several days, Tunis Brady caught the male in
a trap near its den in some rocks in Tinicum
Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania. The
animal put up a terrific fight, and Brady had to
dispatch it with a rifle. The cat was given to State
Game Warden Warren Fretz, of Doylestown,
who took photographs and made arrangements
to have it mounted. It is not known where the
specimen is now. At the time, it seemed obvious
to local people that it was neither a bobcat nor a
feral cat; most favored the theory that it was a
European wildcat, either indigenous to the re-
gion or introduced from Europe long ago.
Possible explanations:
(1) A Bobcat ( Lynx rufus) x feral Domestic
cat ( Felis silvestris catus) hybrid.
TINICUM CAT 551

a terminal flap.
Behavior: Swims against the wind with verti-
cal undulations. Emits phosphorescence, espe-

large body in the water, lit at several points by
natural phosphorescence. The crew obstinately
refused to look at the animal, which they iden-
tified as a Tompondrano that causes great peril.

Greenland.
Possible explanation: The pre-Inuit Dorset
culture (800 B.C.-A.D. 1000) built summer
longhouses roofed with skins anchored to stone
foundations. They spent the winters in snow
houses on the ice, hunting seals. The remains of
their longhouse settlements are attributed to the
Tornit.

The Kamba (Bantu) people who lived near
Mount Kenya knew of a flying animal that left
bipedal tracks and the impression of a heavy tail.
Possible explanation: A surviving pterosaur, a
group of flying reptiles that lived from the Late
Triassic through the Cretaceous, 210-65 mil-
lion years ago.

Tratratratra
Unknown PRIMATE of Madagascar.
Etymology: Malagasy (Austronesian) word,
possibly based on its call.
Variant name: Tretretretre.
Physical description: As large as a two-year-old
calf. Frizzy hair. Face is round and very human-
like. Ears are humanlike. Front and hind feet are
like an ape’s. Short tail.
Behavior: Solitary. If the name is onomatopo-
etic, its call would be a chatter.
Distribution: Madagascar.
Present status: The only known mention was
by Etienne de Flacourt in 1658.
Possible explanations:
(1) A surviving giant lemur of the genus
Palaeopropithecus , which was formerly
widespread in Madagascar and apparently
persisted until at least the sixteenth century.
It weighed 85-130 pounds and was largely
ground-dwelling.
(2) A surviving giant lemur of the genus
Megaladapis, which weighed 85-175
pounds. However, its face was elongated
and tilted upward in a way found in no
other primate and would probably not be
described as like a human’s. Its arms and
legs were short, but its hands and feet were
extraordinarily long. It was arboreal but
probably slow-moving in the trees.
(3) A surviving giant lemur of the genus
Archeolemur or Hadropithecus, which
weighed around 30-55 pounds, probably
too small for this animal.

gering for two winters. Earlier incidents may
have taken place in the late nineteenth century.

Trinity Alps Giant Salamander
Mystery AMPHIBIAN of California.
Physical description: Dark brown, with dull
yellow spots. Length, 2-9 feet. Closed gill open-
ings.
Distribution: Trinity Alps, northern Califor-
nia.
Significant sightings: In the 1920s, Frank L.
Griffith was hunting deer at the head of the
New River when he spotted five huge salaman-
ders at the bottom of a small meadow lake. Al-
though he caught one on a hook, he could not
pull it out.
George S. Myers examined a 25-30-inch
salamander caught in the Sacramento River in
1939.
In January 1960, Vern Harden claimed to
have hooked a specimen measuring 8 feet 4
inches in a remote lake in the Trinity Alps. A
blizzard blew up, and he had to abandon the an-
imal.
Present status: Tom Slick tried to get members
of his 1960 BlGFOOT-hunting Pacific North-
west Expedition to make a side trip in search of
the salamanders, but they balked. Thomas L.
Rodgers, in 1948 and 1960, and Kyle Mi-
zokami, in 1997, unsuccessfully searched for the
animals.
Possible explanations:
(1) An isolated group of Pacific giant
salamanders ( Dicamptodon ensatus ) ,
suggested by Thomas Rodgers, though

adults rarely grow larger than 7-11 inches.
Neotenic individuals can reach a length of
14 inches. In northern California, they are
found as far inland as the headwaters of the
Sacramento River. They are dark brown in
color, with a network of irregular spots of
tan, copper, gray, or purplish.
(2) According to George Myers, it could be
an unknown North American species
related to the Chinese giant salamander
( Andrias davidianus) — the largest amphibian
in the world, which grows to an average
length of 3 feet 9 inches. The longest
recorded specimen was 5 feet 9 inches long.

Triton
Fish-tailed MERBEING of Southern Europe.
Etymology: Greek word, possibly a composite
formed from Amphitrite and Poseidon. Origi-
nally, the son of Poseidon and Amphitrite (a
Nereid) but later a class of fish- tailed Merbeings.
Variant name: Tritonid (for the female).
Physical description: Fialf human, half fish.
Covered with scales. Green hair. Blue eyes. Gills
under the ears. Sharp teeth. Fins on the breast
and belly. Clawed fingers. Forked tail like a
fish’s or dolphin’s.
Behavior: Lascivious. Steals cattle. Enjoys
playing music, especially lyres and conch shells.
Distribution: Mediterranean Sea.
Significant sightings: Pliny recounted that a
manlike Triton was seen climbing into ships at
night in the Gulf of Cadiz, Spain, by reliable
observers and that a delegation from Lisbon,
Portugal, had reported to Emperor Tiberius
(a.D. 14-37) that a Triton had been seen in a
sea cave.
Some women of Tanagra in Voiotia, Greece,
were along the seacoast when they were attacked
by a Triton. It was later beheaded by a man with
an axe. Pausanias noted that dead Tritons could
TRITON 557
be seen as curiosities in Rome and Tanagra,
where he examined a famous preserved speci-
men in A.D. 150.
Possible explanations:
(1) Fake Tritons stitched together from
various fishes, animals, or even human
mummies may have been placed on exhibit
in ancient times, just as fake MERMAIDS
were manufactured in the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries.
(2) Exposed vertebrate fossils — especially
the large Miocene sirenian Halitherium
known from deposits in the Gironde Valley,
France — may have inspired Triton lore.

Etymology: Greek troglodytai, “cave man.”
Scientific name: Homo TROGLODYTES.
Behavior: Can outrun a horse. Squeaks like a
bat. Eats snakes and lizards.
Distribution: Chad; Libya; Kenya.
Possible explanations:
(1) Traditionally associated with the
pastoral Tuareg or Teda peoples of North
Africa.

is more accessible from the Red Sea, which
was better known to Greek geographers
than the Sahara.

True Giant
Term used by Mark A. Hall to distinguish the

Significant sightings: One of the first reports
in North America was of giant footprints, 18
inches long and 9 inches wide, found in the
Okefenokee Swamp, Georgia, sometime prior
to 1829. The stride was just over 6 feet. Shortly
after hearing this account, nine hunters from
Florida set off, determined to find the maker of
the tracks. The party was attacked by a 13-foot
giant that they managed to shoot and kill — but
not before it did away with five of them. No
witness names were given in the newspaper ac-
count of this incident.
On August 20, 1977, Fred C. Wilson, two
other airmen from Malmstrom Air Force Base,
and two young adults were camping in Belt
Creek Canyon, Montana, when they were
chased to their car by a 15-foot hairy giant. It
had an oblong head, flat nose, and canine teeth.
Possible explanation: Hall believes that an
evolved Gigantopithecus, a Pleistocene ape that
lived in Asia as recently as 500,000 years ago,
accounts for the True giant. Its estimated height
was 9-10 feet, and its estimated weight was
900-1,200 pounds. However, no weight-bear-
ing bones have been recovered, and it is possible
that the animal’s teeth and jaws were dispropor-
tionate to its body size.

Tsy-Aomby-Aomby
Mystery HOOFED MAMMAL of Madagascar.
Etymology: Malagasy (Austronesian), “not
cow cow”; perhaps from the Swahili (Bantu) si
ngombe, “not cow.”
Variant names: Kilopilopitsofy (“floppy
ears”), Lalomena, MANGARSAHOC, Omby-rano
(“water cow,” in Mainarivo District), Railalom-
ena (“ancestor of the hippopotamus”), Son-
gomby, Tsomgomby.
Physical description: Looks like a water buffalo
without a hump; like a hippopotamus; or like a
cow, horse, or mule without horns or cloven
hooves. Size of a cow. Dark skin. Some accounts
give it a horn in the middle of its forehead. Pink
areas around the eyes and mouth. Huge, hang-
ing ears.
Behavior: Amphibious. Moves swiftly. Terri-
fying cry or a series of deep, drawn-out grunts.
Eats everything from insects to humans. Stuns
people by spraying its urine on them.
Habitat: Rocky caves, swamps.
Distribution: South and southwestern Mada-
gascar.
Significant sightings: In 1876, Josef-Peter Au-
debert was shown an antelope-like animal hide
said to have come from the Tsy-aomby-aomby
in the south of the island.
A man named Constant and his wife and son
560 TSINQUAW
were awakened by a grunting Kilopilopitsofy
near Belo-sur-Mer, Madagascar, in 1976.
Possible explanation: Surviving Malagasy
pygmy hippopotami ( Hippopotamus lemerlei
and H. madagascariensis) that supposedly died
off within the past 1,000 years or so. Both
species were similar in shape to their closest re-
lation, the common Hippopotamus ( H . am -
phibius ), but smaller, with a length of 6 feet 6
inches and a shoulder height of 2 feet 6 inches.
H. lemerlei s eyes were placed higher on its head.
African hippos are often aggressive and intimi-
date opponents by spraying urine and feces.
They don’t eat people but will attack and kill
them when threatened. H. lemerlei was more
amphibious and lived in west Madagascan
rivers; H. madagascariensis favored the highland
prairies of the interior.

larger than a gibbon. Dark-red hair.
Behavior: Can stand on two legs.
Distribution: Southern Myanmar; Thailand.
Significant sightings: In the 1880s, a man
named Davison saw a dark-red primate standing
erect in southern Myanmar. Around the same
time, an army captain named Bingham acquired
a dead Tua yeua; he preserved the skeleton, but
it has since been lost.
Possible explanations:
(1) The dark-brown Stump-tailed macaque
(. Macaca arctoides) is known in the area and
has a bare, red face and forehead and only a
vestigial tail. It usually travels in troops and
is quadrupedal.
(2) An unknown species of monkey similar
to the REN-XlONG of China.
(3) A Wildman of the Chinese Ye-Ren
variety.

TURTLES (Unknown)
Turtles (Order Testudines or Chelonia) are
unique among vertebrates in having a shell that
incorporates both dermal armor, vertebrae, and
ribs. Other characteristics include a lengthened
neck, limb girdles that lie within the ribcage, a
keratinous beak instead of teeth, and limbs that
retract into the shell (except in marine turtles).
There is considerable uncertainty about which
reptile group gave rise to them; evidence exists
for both the anapsids (the procolophonids and
parieasaurs) and the diapsids (lizards and
snakes).
The earliest turtles in the Late Triassic 210
million years ago could not withdraw their
heads into their shells: In Proganochelys, the
head was protected by loose armor plates, in the
tortoiselike australochelids the neck was
guarded by an extension of the carapace.
There are two major groups of living turtles.
The Side-necked turtles (Suborder Pleurodira)
are able to fold their necks sideways into their
shells, while the Hidden-necked turtles (Subor-
der Cryptodira) pull their necks straight back
between their shoulder blades. Pleurodires, such
as the Snake-necks ( Chelodina :) and the Mata-
mata ( Chelus fimbriatus ), are only found in
South America, Australia, and Africa. The cryp-
todires include Snapping turtles (Chelydridae),
Sea turtles (Chelonioidea), Softshelled turtles
(Trionychoidea), and Freshwater terrapins and
Land tortoises (Testudinoidea). By the Late
Jurassic, sea turtles were common in many areas
of Europe and Asia.
The largest living turtle is the Pacific
leatherback ( Dermochelys coriacea ), which is
found throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans
and averages 6-7 feet from beak to tail. The
largest freshwater turtle is the Alligator snapping
turtle (. Macroclemys temminckii ), which has an
average length of 15-26 inches and a record
length of 31.5 inches; weights upwards of 300
pounds have been recorded. The largest known
fossil turtle, Archelon ischyros, measured up to 16
feet long and 12 feet wide and may have weighed
as much as 1 1,000 pounds. It lived some 70 mil-
lion years ago in marine waters of the Late Cre-
taceous. Its fossils have been found in South
Dakota, Kansas, and Colorado.
The Hindu legend of a giant tortoise that
supports an elephant on which the earth rests
could be based on fossils of the Pliocene Testudo
[Colossochelys] atlas, a land tortoise with a cara-
pace 6 feet wide that is known from deposits in
northern India and Pakistan. Hugh Falconer
and P.T. Cautley, “Conclusion of Paper on
Colossochelys atlas Proceedings of the Zoological
Society of London 12 (1844): 84-88.
Of the six turtles in this list, one appears to be
an alligator snapper, one is an enormous marine
cryptid, one is a land tortoise that may have sur-
vived until very recently, one could be a giant
softshell or pleurodire, one is probably a known
species of softshell, and one is a six-legged
anomaly.

Tzuchinoko
Unknown SNAKE of Japan.
Etymology: Japanese, “son of the straw bat”;
tzuchi (“batlike toy made of straw”) + noko
( son ).
Variant names: Tsuchinoko and as many as
forty other names meaning “rolling hammer,”
“snake bat,” or “horizontal bat.”
Physical description: Short and stocky. Length,
2-3 feet. Width, 3 inches. Very large body
scales. Iridescent dark gray and brown with ten
or fewer large, black spots above, bright orange
below. Wide, triangular head. Squat horns.
Small, round eyes. Eyelids (or protruding
scales). Two facial pits between the eyes and
nostrils. Red tongue, not forked. Distinct, con-
stricted neck. Wide body. Two crests along the
spine. Flat undersurface. No vertebrae in the
tail. Short tail, said to be prehensile.
Behavior: Moves both by lateral undulations
and rectilinear forward progression. Said to be
able to curl into a ball, roll downhill, leap into
the air, and change color. Can swim. Whistles,
hoots, snores, or moans. Disagreeable odor.
Feeds on small mammals. Aggressive and highly
venomous. Can spit venom from a distance.
Habitat: Fields, forests, hillside swamps.
Distribution: Interior mountains of Honshu,
Shikoku, and Kyushu Islands, Japan. Also re-
ported in Korea, eastern China, and possibly
New Guinea.
TZUCHINOKO 563
Significant sightings: The Tzuchinoko has
been mentioned in Japanese literature since the
thirteenth century.
A farmer named Tokutake ran across a
Tzuchinoko in June 1969 in central Honshu. It
leaped at him but missed, and he captured it.
After keeping it several days, he killed, cooked,
and ate it. He claimed to have found three
small, half-digested rabbits inside. It was less
than 2 feet long.
In 1970, a couple encountered a Tzuchinoko
near Tojikimi, southeast of Osaka. It moved
swiftly, twisting from left to right. It had large
scales, marked with large spots like a boa.
On August 18, 1995, a resident of Aida-
machi, Okayama Prefecture, saw a dark-blue,
snakelike creature about 20 inches long in the
mountains. Its eyes were moving rapidly, and
the witness retreated briefly. When he returned,
it was gone.
Mitsuko Arima saw a Tzuchinoko on June
15, 2000, swimming along a river.
Possible explanations:
(1) Misidentified Mamush pit viper
(. Agkistrodon halys blomhojfi ), which has a
similar size, coloration, and habitat, or a
racial variation of the same snake.
(2) Unknown species of Pit viper
(Crotalinae), with some characteristics
of African vipers (Viperinae), such as a
squat body, rectilinear locomotion, large
dorsal scales, and raised scales above
the eyes.

564 TZUCHINOKO
u
Ucumar
Giant Hominid of South America.
Etymology: After its ululating call.
Variant names: Sachayoj, Ucu, Ukumar-zupai
(in Tolar Grande). In Bolivia and Peru, the spec-
tacled bear is known as Ucamari or Jucamari.
Physical description: Half man, half bear. Cov-
ered in long, black hair. Bearded. Small eyes.
Large hands and feet. Opposed toes.
Behavior: Bipedal. Makes eerie, ululating calls
(“uhu, uhu”) at night. Eats wild fruit and
honey. Said to abduct women for breeding.
Tracks: Humanlike. Length, 17 inches.
Habitat: Mountains, caves, and rocky areas.
Distribution: Tolar Grande, Mount
Umahuaca, El Chorro, and Baritu National
Park in Salta Province, Caliliegua in Jujuy
Province, Chaco Province, all in Argentina.
Possible explanation: The Spectacled bear
( Tremarctos ornatus ) is found in the Andes as far
south as northern Argentina. Its occasional for-
ays into Argentina could contribute to Ucumar
folklore.

Ufiti
Mystery PRIMATE of Central Africa.
Etymology: From the Nyanja (Bantu) mfiti
(“ghost”).
Variant names: Fired, Ogo.
Physical description: Height, 5 feet 6 inches.
Weight, 150 pounds. Short, dense fur. Two col-
orations, gray and black, indicate sexual dimor-
phism. Pale gray on the back. Completely black
face, ears, hands, and feet.
Behavior: Takes an amiable interest in con-
struction work.
Tracks: Four toes show in one available pho-
tograph.
Distribution: Nkhata Bay, Malawi.
Significant sightings: In November 1959, a
large ape covered with long, black hair was seen
watching construction workers repairing a
bridge and a road near the village of Nkhata Bay
on the western shore of Lake Nyasa, Malawi.
Photos taken by J. Leonard Goodwin in Febru-
ary 1960 clearly show an adult female chim-
panzee. Sightings persisted for several years be-
fore a specimen, nicknamed “Ogo,” was finally
captured in March 1964 and sent to the Chester
Zoo in England, where it died shortly afterward
(on April 23) of a parasitic lung infection. Ap-
parently, no definitive examination was made,
and sightings in Malawi seemed to stop
abruptly.
Present status: Chimpanzees are not native to
Malawi, and the closest live about 500 miles
away on the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika.
A larger variety of unknown ape, called Fireti, is
also said to inhabit Malawi.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Ufiti might have been an errant
Chimpanzee {Pan troglodyte s) from
Tanzania. However, the description is closer
to the West African chimpanzee, P. t. verus
(dark mask, high and narrow head, light
muzzle that darkens with age, bearded,
flesh-colored palms and soles), than the
565
geographically closer Eastern chimpanzee, P.
t. schweinfurthi (light to dark face, dark hair,
beard). The gray lumbar saddle is more
characteristic of a male gorilla.
(2) An unknown subspecies of chimpanzee,
suggested by W. C. Osman Hill, since
earlier accounts were also recorded in the
area and could indicate a stable population.
(3) The last of a remnant population of
chimpanzees, isolated for many years in this
pocket of Central Africa.

Ular Tedong
Freshwater Monster of Southeast Asia.
Etymology: Semelai (Austroasiatic), “buffalo
snake.”
Physical description: Serpentine. Grayish when
young, golden when mature. Width, 6 feet at its
middle. Big, snakelike head. Small, soft horns.

Possible explanation: A surviving long-necked,
aquatic reptile like an elasmosaurus, suggested
by Karl Shuker. Its total length of 33 feet in-
cluded a huge neck with seventy cervical verte-
brae. It lived in the Late Cretaceous of North
America, 90-65 million years ago.

Unicorn
Horselike animal with a single horn; see SEMI-
MYTHICAL BEASTS. Unicorn legends have a long
and cosmopolitan history ranging throughout
most of Europe, Africa, and Asia. The Unicorn
of Western lore is based on a complex number
of traditions and animals that can be grouped
into three major trends: Unicorns in classical
Western literature, the Unicorn of the medieval
bestiaries, and reports of one-horned animals in
the Renaissance and afterward. In addition, the
visual conventions of Christian art and heraldry
turned the small, goatlike animal of the bes-
tiaries into a conventional white horse with a
horn. Legends of an Asian unicorn (Ki-Lin) also
fed into the popular imagination.
Etymology: From the Latin uni (“one”) +
cornu (“horn”).
Variant names: Abou-karn, Agaba, Alicornio
(Portuguese), A’nasa (in Sudan), Bundiaru (Ka-
nuri/Nilo-Saharan), CAMPCHURCH, Cartazonus
(related to the Sanskrit kartdjan, “lord of the
desert”), Dajja, Dakarkulewal (Fulfulde/
Fulani), Iwu (Yoruba/Defoid), Kamarami (Ka-
nuri/Nilo-Saharan), Karafitu (Margi/Chadic),

Nzoo-dzoo (in South Africa), Panlili
(Nupe/Niger-Congo), PATAGONIAN UNICORN,
Re’em (Hebrew/Semitic), Tenesek (Tamasheq/
Berber), Yilifu (Fulfulde/Fulani).
Physical descriptions:
Ancient unicorn — White, asslike animal.
Dark-red head. On its forehead is a single spi-
raled horn 1 8-24 inches long; its base is white,
the middle portion black, and the sharp tip is
crimson. Blue eyes. Mane. Thick, oxlike ankle-
bone. One-toed hooves. Tail like a goat’s or
boar’s.
The Bestiary unicorn — Small, goatlike animal.
Long, white, spiral horn. Cloven hooves.
African unicorn — Medium-sized animal like a
colt or a wild bull. Top third of the body is scar-
let, the rest is ashen-gray. Almost hairless.
Mane. A single, grooved, ivory- or black-colored
horn, 18-36 inches long, grows between the
eyes. Beard like a goat’s. Legs and feet of an ele-
phant. Short tail.
Behaviors:
Ancient unicorn — Swift runner. Powerful
voice. Also makes a deep, lowing sound. Males
instinctively butt and fight each other. Pulver-
ized horn is said to be an antitoxin or aphro-
disiac. Drinking out of the horn prevents
epilepsy and other diseases. Its flesh is too bitter
to be eaten.
Bestiary unicorn — Cautious but is said to lay
its head on the lap of a virgin, allowing it to be
captured. Its horn has the ability to detect and
negate poison.
African unicorn — Horn swings to either side
as it walks. Sheds its horn like a stag. Leaves
tracks like a zebra. Charges at humans and other
animals with horn lowered.
Distribution: Arabia; India; Tibet; South
Africa; Nigeria; Chad; Ethiopia; Sudan; Pales-
tine; Egypt; Iran; Uzbekistan; Ukraine; Poland;
Scandinavia; Florida; Maine.
Significant sightings: There are only a few eye-
witness reports of a living animal. Most ac-
counts are rumors or artistic depictions. One of
the earliest mentions is in the Indika of Ctesias,
a Greek physician of the late fifth century B.C.
who visited Persia and heard fabulous stories
about India. He described a white wild ass with
an 18-inch-long horn on its dark-red head.
In the first century B.C., Julius Caesar wrote
that an animal like a one-horned stag lived in
the Erzgebirge of southern Germany.
Unicorn horns were highly prized as curios by
European royalty in the Renaissance. Nobles
and monarchs said to possess one or more of
them included Edward IV of England, James III
of Scotland, Pietro de’ Medici, Pope Clement
VII, Pope Julius III, and Philip II of Spain.
Felix Fabri and other pilgrims saw a large,
one-horned animal from a distance near Mount
Sinai, Egypt, on September 20, 1483.
Lodovico de Varthema reported hearing in
1503 that there were two Unicorns in a park
outside the temple at Mecca, Arabia. One was as
large as a colt and had a horn 4 feet 6 inches
long, while the younger one was smaller and had

UNICORN. From Konrad Gesner, Historiae animalium
(Zurich: Christ. Froschoverum, 1551-1587). (From the
original in the Special Collections of Northwestern
University Library)
a 16-inch horn. The animals’ hooves were
cloven. They had been given as a gift from a
king in Ethiopia to the sultan of Mecca. At the
port of Saylac, Somalia, he also observed cattle
with single horns that bent backward from their
brows.
Around 1630, the Jesuit Jeronimo Lobo
noted the common occurrence of the Unicorn
in Ethiopia. It looked like a bay horse with a
black tail and long mane.
Some time before 1669, a group of Por-
tuguese soldiers ran across a Unicorn in
Ethiopia, where the animals were said to be
often seen grazing in the mountains.
In 1673, Olfert Dapper wrote that Unicorns
were said to live in the woods near the Canadian
border, presumably in Maine. They resembled
horses but had cloven hooves, a long and
straight horn on the forehead, and a curled tail
like a boar’s. Most likely, he was referring to the
Moose {Alces alces).
In the late eighteenth century, an unnamed
Boer saw an ash-gray Unicorn with cloven
hooves in South Africa.
In 1820, John Campbell came across a “real
unicorn” that had been killed by the inhabitants
of South Africa. It had a 3-foot horn projecting
1 0 inches above the tip of its nose, and its head
was 3 feet from mouth to ear.
In the nineteenth century, caves in the inte-
rior of South Africa were said to contain draw-
ings of Unicorn-like animals.
Eduard Riippell (in the 1820s) and Baron
von Muller (in 1848) both heard of a horse- or
donkeylike, one-horned animal in the Kurdufan
region of Sudan. Muller said it was called A’nasa
and had a movable horn.
In April 1843, Fulgence Fresnel, the French
consul at Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, wrote that sev-
eral Arabs he knew often killed a Unicorn-like
animal in eastern Chad. The animal looked like
a wild bull with legs like an elephant’s, a short
tail, and a single movable horn. Most of it was
gray, but the front part was a vivid scarlet.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Indian rhinoceros ( Rhinoceros
unicornus) is the best-known single-horned
mammal and one whose history is
intertwined with ancient accounts of the
Unicorn. Its horn has similarly been valued
as both a curative and an aphrodisiac since
ancient times.
(2) The long antlers of the Chiru
(. Pantholops hodgsonii ), an antelope of
northern India, China, and Tibet, could be
mistaken for a single horn when viewed
from the side.
(3) The Arabian oryx ( Oryx leucoryx) is a
graceful, white animal with long, straight
horns. It once ranged over much of the
Arabian Peninsula.
(4) The Onager or Persian wild ass ( Equus
hemionus onager) formerly ranged widely
across southern Russia, Iran, and
Afghanistan. It is a swift runner and was
captured in ancient times as a breeding
animal. The back and legs are rusty brown
and the underside is white. It has no horn,
but Ctesias may have gotten it confused
with the rhinoceros.
(5) The Aurochs ( Bos primigenius) was
extinct in Palestine when the Bible was first
translated from Hebrew into Greek in the
third century B.C. (the Septuagint version),
so the scholars responsible for the
translation of the word re’em rendered it as
monoceros in Greek. This was converted to
Unicorn in the King James Version. Modern
568 UNICORN
editions of the Old Testament now translate
it as “wild ox,” its original meaning.
(6) Spiral tusks from the Narwhal (. Monodon
monoceros) were widely circulated in the
Middle Ages as Unicorn horns. In 1638, the
Danish scholar Ole Wurm was the first to
identify them as originating from this Arctic
whale.
(7) From the sixteenth to eighteenth
centuries, herding tribes of East Africa used
to twist the horns of their cattle into a
single shape that curved backward. This
practice probably accounts for Lodovico de
Varthema’ s report of one-horned cattle in
Somalia in 1503.
(8) A large White rhinoceros ( Ceratotherium
simuni) probably explains John Campbell’s
1 820 discovery in South Africa of a dead
rhino (“real unicorn”) that he thought was a
new species.
(9) Genetic anomalies may have formed
occasional single-horned bulls that attained
herd dominance. A grafting experiment by
William Franklin Dove in 1934 produced a
one-horned calf that adapted well to its
singularity.
(10) A surviving Pleistocene antelope
(. Procamptoceras brivatense) that lived in
Europe 1 million years ago. It had two
slightly curved, upward-pointing horns that
were close together and may have appeared
to be a single horn.

V
Vadoma
Tribe of WlLDMEN of South Africa.
Physical description: Human but only has two
ostrichlike toes.
Behavior: Swift runner. Climbs trees easily.
Distribution: Zambezi River valley, northern
Zimbabwe.
Possible explanation: The Vadoma are a group
of about thirty formerly seminomadic families

congenital deformity of bidactyly, wherein only
the first and fifth toes or fingers develop, occurs
with some regularity due to inbreeding and has
perpetuated the myth of a two-toed tribe.

Significant sighting: Alexander von Humboldt
571
reported that a woman of San Carlos in the
Llanos region of Venezuela lived with a Vasitri

Possible explanations:
(1) Humboldt thought it might be a bear,
but the only species in South America is the
Spectacled bear ( Tremarctos ornatus ), known
from the Andes.
(2) One of a number of Indian groups of
the interior noted for their aggressiveness
and who used to abduct women belonging

Voronpatra
Giant flightless Bird of Madagascar.
Etymology: From the Malagasy (Austronesian)
voron (“bird”) + patra (uncertain meaning).
Variant name: Vouroupatra.
Physical description: Large. Ostrichlike.
Significant sighting: In 1658, the first French
governor of Madagascar, Etienne de Flacourt,
described a large, elusive bird that laid eggs like
an ostrich.
Possible explanation: Undoubtedly, this de-
scription referred to the Giant elephantbird
(. Aepyornis maximus), the heaviest known bird,
which stood 10 feet high and weighed nearly
1,000 pounds. Its eggs were over a foot in
length, had a capacity equivalent to 150 hen’s
eggs, and constituted the largest single cell
known on Earth. Mullerornis was a smaller
species about the size of an ostrich. When Aepy-
ornis became extinct is not known. It probably
existed in remote spots in the interior during the
seventeenth century and was well known to the
VORONPATRA 573
Antandroy tribe in the south. It may even have
lingered until the mid-nineteenth century,
when its subfossil eggs first started exciting sci-
entific interest.

it stopped and lay still for about thirty minutes.
Its 5 -inch head-hair floated loosely in the water.

Waheela
Giant Dog of northern North America.
Etymology: Unknown; only heard in one in-
stance in Michigan.
Variant name: Great white wolf.
Physical description: Larger and more robust
than a normal male wolf. Shoulder height, 3 feet
6 inches. Weight, 200 pounds. White, shaggy
hair. Large, broad head. Small ears. Front legs
are long in comparison to hind legs. Splayed
feet. Thick tail.
Behavior: Said to be a solitary scavenger in
Nahanni and to hunt moose in packs in On-
tario.
Tracks: Like a wolf s but 8 inches across.
Habitat: Tundra but may migrate south in
winter.
Distribution: Alaska; South Nahanni River
valley, Northwest Territories, Canada; Hearst,
Ontario; northern Michigan.
Significant sighting: A friend of Ivan Sander-
son was hunting along a tributary of the South
Nahanni upriver from Virginia Falls when he
ran across an enormous white wolf with a wide
head and shaggy hair. He shot at it twice but ap-
parently did no damage. The area formerly had
a reputation for the mysterious deaths of
prospectors, who had their heads bitten or torn
off.
Possible explanations:
(1) An outsize Gray wolf ( Canis lupis ),
which generally stands no more than 2 feet
6 inches at the shoulder and weighs a
maximum of 175 pounds. Its color
sometimes approaches nearly white in the
Arctic. Normal wolf tracks are 4-5 inches
across.
(2) A surviving species of Bear-dog (Family
Amphicyonidae), a group of predators that
lived in North America about 34-5 million
years ago, from the Late Eocene through the
Miocene. They had wolflike faces and
medium-to-large bodies, with massive thigh
and shoulder bones. Most had plantigrade
feet, but some were digitigrade. Some
species could climb trees like bears, while
others were adapted for running.

Waigeo Six-Legged Snake
Legendary SNAKE of Australasia.
Physical description: Snake with six legs.
Distribution: Waigeo Island, Irian Jaya, In-
donesia.
Possible explanation: Mythical animal.
Source: Evelyn Cheesman, Six-Legged Snakes
in New Guinea (London: Harrap, 1949).
Waitoreke
Unknown OTTER-like animal of Australasia.
Etymology: Maori (Austronesian) word of un-
certain meaning. Possibly wai (“water,” or “one
who”) + to (“dive”) + reke (“bone spur” or
“knob”), meaning “spurred one who sinks into
the water.” Or wai (“water”) + toreke (“left be-
hind”), thus meaning “disappearing under the
water.” However, the root waito- often has a
connotation of the spirit world, producing the
meaning, “disappearing demon.” Another possi-
bility is “the one with wrinkles,” if reke is taken
to mean “wrinkled.”
Variant names: KAUREHE, New Zealand otter,
South Island otter, Waitoreki, Waitoteke.
Physical description: Otterlike or seal-like pla-
cental mammal, marsupial, or monotreme with
glossy brown fur. Length, 2 feet-3 feet 6 inches.
Small eyes. Flat, round ears. Possible bone spur.
Thick, fiat tail.
Behavior: Slides down riverbanks. Makes a
whistling sound. Emits a musky odor. Eats
fishes. Lives in either holes in riverbanks or a
beaverlike lodge. Possibly lays eggs, which
would make it a monotreme.
Tracks: Webbed. Width, 3-4 inches. Similar
to a river otter but smaller. Stride, 7-8 inches.
Habitat: Rivers and lakes.
Distribution: Mountain ranges of southern
South Island, New Zealand.
Significant sightings: Several crew members of
Capt. James Cook’s expedition saw a cat-sized
animal with short legs and a bushy tail when
they were anchored in Dusky Bay in May 1773.
In the late 1850s, Julius von Haast reported
seeing Waitoreke tracks on the upper Ashbur-
ton River, in the Southern Alps. However, a
later account suggests that another waggish
member of Haast’s party had hoaxed the prints.
Around 1880, two hunters shot an otterlike
animal at Lake Hauroko.
In 1921, A. E. Trapper saw a Waitoreke
while on a bridge crossing the Waikiwi River.
Some months later, he found a hole in the bank
where the animal had disappeared. He had seen
similar animals on fishing expeditions to lonely
spots on five previous occasions since 1890.
Mrs. O. Linscott watched an animal swim
across a lagoon near the Aparima River in 1957.
It had a brownish-purple face, small eyes,
rounded ears, short whiskers, and catlike fur.
P. J. A. Bradley was hunting deer on the Hol-
lyford River in 1971 when he saw an otterlike
animal climbing and sliding down the bank. It
was about 3 feet long and had a short, thick tail.
In April 1973 in a swamp on the Taieri Plain,
G. A. Pollock discovered a system of tunnels
that seemed characteristic of an otter.
Possible explanations:
(1) The description and behavior matches
the rare Hairy-nosed otter ( Lutra
sumatrana ), found in Java, Borneo,
Sumatra, and Malaysia, where it is
domesticated and trained to catch fish. G.
A. Pollock suggests that it was introduced to
New Zealand from Indonesia as early as the
sixteenth century by colonists or castaways.
(2) A wayward population of Sea otters
( Enhydra lutris) that traveled to New
Zealand by sea.
576 WAHTEETA
(3) An introduced population of Platypus
( Ornithorhynchus anatinus) from Australia.
(4) Stray seals, most likely the New Zealand
sea lion ( Phocarctos hookeri ), the New
Zealand fur seal (Ar otocephalus forsteri ), or
the Southern elephant seal ( Mirounga
leonina).
(5) An introduced Beaver (Castors pp.),
based on the occasional report of a lodge.
(6) The Golden-bellied water-rat (Hydromys
chrysogastei) , found in Australia, New
Guinea, and the Philippines. It is 2 feet
long and has a 2-foot-long tail and large,
partially webbed hind feet.
(7) An unknown species of monotreme,
perhaps spiny like Echidnas (Family
Tachyglossidae) or with a spur like the
platypus.

Waracabra Tiger
Unknown Cat of South America.
Etymology: After Waracabra, the Guyanese
name for the Gray-winged trumpeter ( Psophia
crepitans), because of this bird’s loud cry.
Variant names: Warracaba jaguar, Y’agamish-
eri (Akawaio/Carib).
Physical description: Like the common jaguar
but variable in size and color.
Behavior: Hunts in large packs of up to 100,
unlike normal jaguars, which are solitary
hunters. Howls loudly. Heard but rarely seen.
Not afraid of fire. Hates water and dogs. Fright-
ened by the barking of dogs.
Habitat: Mountains.
Distribution: West-central Guyana.
Significant sighting: Charles Barrington
Brown’s party heard the approach of a pack of
these animals in the mid-nineteenth century
during an expedition to the interior. His Indian
guides crossed the river to avoid it. On the side
where they had been, they heard shrill screams,
low growls, and trumpeting sounds.
Possible explanation: The Bush dog ( Speothos
venaticus) hunts in packs, yapping while in pur-
suit of prey. It also engages in high-pitched
whining. Rare and little seen over much of its
range, which extends from Panama to Guyana,
Brazil, and Bolivia.

Cedar Valley.
In October 1955, Blue Mountains residents
and police searched extensive areas of bushland
between Wentworth Falls and the Blaxland-
Glenbrook area in search of a large, shaggy-
haired lionlike animal.
In 1 977, three hunters were approached by a
lion in the Mulgoa District, New South Wales.
They fired at it, and it ran off into the scrub.
Rex Gilroy found large cat tracks a few days
old in a cave near Medlow Bath in 1978.
In February 2001, two bushwalkers in the
Wollangambie Wilderness saw a 5-foot, black
animal perched on a tree limb and feeding on a
wallaby.
Possible explanations:
(1) A lion ( Panthera leo) that escaped from a
zoo.
(2) A surviving Marsupial lion ( Thylacoleo
carnifex ), a leopard-sized, arboreal marsupial
that lived as recently as 10,000 years ago,
proposed by Rex Gilroy.

580 WATER BULL
Physical description: Leopardlike shape. As
large as a horse. Tusks or large canine teeth.
Spotted or striped. Background color varies
from yellow or brown to reddish. Maned. Claws
like a lion’s.
Behavior: Aquatic. Nocturnal.
Habitat: Caves in riverbanks.
Distribution: Angola; Gabon; Central African
Republic; Democratic Republic of the Congo;
Chad; the Upper Nile River in Sudan; Kenya.
Significant sighting: A cave painting at Brak-
fontein Ridge, Free State Province, South Africa,
shows a walruslike animal attacking what looks
to be a porcupine. It has a small head with two
downward-curving tusks and paddlelike limbs.
Possible explanations:
(1) A surviving saber-toothed cat of the
genus Machairodus , first suggested by Ingo
Krumbiegel and elaborated by Bernard
Heuvelmans. Though fossil saber-toothed
cats are not known to have lived in the
water, this adaptation cannot be ruled out.
Large teeth might prove beneficial in an
aquatic environment, as with the walrus,
but they could be a handicap in competing
for food on land with modern big cats. A
saber-toothed cat could easily drag its large
prey under water, where the competition for
the carcass is less intense. Machairodus cats
ranged in size up to that of a lion, and they
had elongated upper canines and cheek
teeth adapted for slicing meat. They first
turned up in Eurasia in the Miocene about
1 5 million years ago and lingered until
about 2 million years ago in Tunisia.
(2) An unknown species of giant Monitor
lizard (Family Varanidae).
(3) A surviving sauropod dinosaur similar to
an Apatosaurus y although these were
primarily herbivores. Some confusion with
such dinosaur-like cryptids as the MOKELE-
MBEMBE may occur.
(4) A ceratopsian dinosaur, suggested by
Martin Wilfarth, although this suborder is
not known from Africa. Better-known
species include Monoclonius, Psittacosaurus,
Protoceratops, and Pricer atop s. Usually, these
dinosaurs had a large frill or flange around
the head along with facial horns. Some
confusion with such dinosaur-like cryptids
as the Emela-Ntouka may occur.
(5) An aquatic variety of the PYGMY
ELEPHANT might also contribute to various
reports or descriptions, as suggested by
Bernard Heuvelmans.

Water Tiger
Aquatic saber-toothed Cat of South America.
Variant names: Aypa, Entzaeia-yawa
(Shuar/Jivaroan), MAIPOLINA, Mutant jaguar,
YAQUARU.
Physical description: Size of a jaguar or slightly
larger. Two large, protruding teeth. Fawn, yel-
lowish, black, white, brown, or reddish un-
marked coat. Bushy tail.
Behavior: Nocturnal. Attacks humans.
Distribution: French Guiana; Colombia; Mo-
rona-Santiago Province, Ecuador; Amapa State,
Brazil; Paraguay; southern Argentina.
Significant sightings: In the nineteenth cen-
tury, William Bollaert found sculptured stones
at Timana, Colombia, showing a cat with large
teeth.
Manuel Palacio claimed that cave paintings in
the Lago Posadas area, Santa Cruz Province, Ar-
gentina, depict a saber-toothed cat attacking an
extinct long-necked animal with an elongated,
tapirlike snout — possibly an odd-toed litoptern
ungulate (genus Macrauchenia) that ultimately
died out in the Pleistocene before the arrival of
humans.
In the 1950s, a sailor named Picquet de-
scribed to Peter Matthiessen a jaguar-sized cat
WATERTIGER 581
with large, protruding teeth that lived in the
jungles of Colombia and Ecuador.
In 1975, a “mutant jaguar” with 12-inch
fangs was shot in Paraguay. A zoologist named
Juan Acavar examined it and suggested it might
be a surviving Smilodon.
Juan Bautista Rivadeneira saw a Water tiger
at the mouth of the Rio Jurumbaino, Ecuador,
in 1989. It was black, with short legs and a cow-
like tail.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Giant otter ( Pteronura brasiliensis) is
catlike, but it has distinct splotches of cream
and brown on its throat.
(2) A surviving Saber-toothed cat ( Smilodon
spp.), a genus of large cats that lived in the
late Pleistocene, 11,000 years ago. These
animals averaged 4 feet long, had short tails
and large heads, and huge canines in the
upper jaw. Smilodon was the only saber-
toothed carnivore that migrated to South
America from the north.
(3) A surviving Marsupial saber-tooth
( Thylacosmilus atrox) , which had been in
South America since the Miocene, 15
million years ago, and was displaced by the
migrating saber-toothed cats. It was about
the size of a jaguar and had a short tail and
canines that were actually longer than
Smilodon s. Its lower jaw had bony flanges
where the upper fangs rested.

Waterbobbejan
Unknown PRIMATE of South Africa.
Etymology: Afrikaans, “water baboon.”
Variant name: Fudu (Tswana/ Bantu).
Physical description: Baboonlike animal.
Height, 6 feet. Reddish hair. Long, powerful
arms.
Behavior: Shy and solitary. Prowls the out-
skirts of farms, raiding livestock. Strips oranges
off the trees.
Habitat: Near water, in caves or behind wa-
terfalls.
Distribution: Northern South Africa.
Significant sighting: In 1965, two boys saw the
animal on the Leeufontein farm between Koster
and Swartruggens, North-West Province, South
Africa.
Present status: Rumors about the animal have
existed since the 1880s.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Chacma baboon ( Papio cynocephalus
ursinus) is well known in the area but only
grows to about 2 feet 6 inches long.
(2) The Samango monkey (Cer copith ecus
mitis labiatus) is even smaller. However, in
at least one instance, a farmer shot and
killed a samango, claiming it was a
Waterbobbejan.

Watu Wa Miti
Small Hominid of South Africa.
Etymology: Swahili (Bantu), “men of the
trees.
Variant name: Chimanimani (“small”).
Behavior: Aggressive and warlike.
Distribution: The Mozambique coast; north-
western Mozambique; the neighboring Chi-
manimani Mountains of Zimbabwe.
Significant sightings: Cuthbert Burgoyne ob-
served a pair of hairy men about 4-5 feet tall on
the Mozambique coast in 1927.
In the 1940s, Frederick Kaigh met a sorcerer
who told him the small people were the spirits
of a race who had been killed off in various wars
and a famine but who nonetheless occasionally
raid gardens for food.

WEASELS (Unknown)
Weasels, wolverines, polecats, and martens con-
stitute the Subfamily Mustelinae and are closely
related to OTTERS, badgers, and skunks. Only
one weasel has made the cryptid list, an obscure
yellowish animal in China. However, two
minor controversies exist in England over (1)
whether the European polecat (. Mustela puto-
rius) and the European pine marten (. Martes
martes) persist in the wild, and (2) whether the
Stone martin (. Martes foina) and the white phase
(ermine) of the Short-tailed weasel ( Mustela er-
minea) are native or introduced. Jonathan

Wee Oichy
Freshwater Monster of Scotland.
Etymology: Named after Loch Oich in 1961
by a reporter in the Scottish Daily Express.
Physical description: Like a huge otter. Black.
Shaggy head. Snakelike neck and body. Two
humps, 3 feet high and 3 feet apart.
Distribution: Loch Oich, Highland.
Significant sightings: In August 1936, Aider-
man A. J. Richards, of Camberwell Borough
Council, and two other witnesses saw an otter-
like animal emerge from the water close to their
boat near Laggan.
Simon Cameron, canal bridgekeeper at Lag-
gan, saw one close up on September 19, 1936.
Journalist Jonathan Routh and some friends
built a device that traveled monsterlike through
the water and managed to get someone to pho-
tograph it for the Scottish Daily Express on July
8, 1961.
Present status: This loch at the southern end of
Loch Ness also has a WATER HORSE tradition.

Welsh Winged Snake
Flying Reptile of Wales.
Physical description: Has a sparkling crest on
its head. Wings have circular markings like a
peacock’s feathers. Feathery skin.
Behavior: Can glide for short distances. Rests
in a coiled position. Vicious when wounded.
Flies over people’s heads when angry. Fond of
raiding henhouses.
Habitat: Rocky gorges, waterfalls, and forests.
Distribution: Waterfalls of the Rivers Hepste,
Perrdin, and Mellte in Powys; Pont-Nedd-
Fechan, Erwood, Ystradgynlais, Radnor Forest,
and the Brecon Beacons, Powys; Resolven and
Ynys-y-Gerwn, near Aberdulais, Neath Port

Lleyn Peninsula and Cadair Idris, Gwynedd; the
Berwyn Mountains, Denbighshire; the Cam-
brian Mountains, Ceredigion; Worms Head,
Swansea; Penlline Castle, Porthkerry Park, and
Llancarfan, Vale of Glamorgan.
Significant sighting: In the first half of the
nineteenth century, a sizable population of
winged serpents was said to live in the forest
WELSH WINGED SNAKE 583
around Penlline Castle, northwest of Cow-
bridge. In 1909, Marie Trevelyan interviewed
several aged residents who either remembered
the creatures from childhood or had heard sto-
ries about them from parents and grandparents,
some of whom had actually hunted these
snakes.
Present status: Exterminated in the nineteenth
century because of its attacks on poultry farms.
Possible explanations: An actual winged snake
of this description in the British Isles would go
a long way toward explaining the prevalence of
DRAGON legends in the United Kingdom.

Werewolf
Canine or vulpine ENTITY of Europe and North
America. Although only of tangential relevance,
the Werewolf nonetheless crops up with some
frequency in cryptozoological literature, as a
folk explanation for ALIEN Big DOGS or the
BEAST OF Gevaudan or as a source of confusion
with sightings of paranormal-looking HAIRY
Bipeds.
Etymology: From the Old English wer
(“man”) + wulf (“wolf’), derived from the
Greek lycanthropos (“wolf-man”). Adam Dou-
glas argues, however, that the “were-“ prefix
comes from the Old Norse vargr (“wolf” or
“outlaw”).
Variant names: Beast of Gevaudan, Bis-
clavret (in Brittany), Bray Road Beast, Garwalf
(Norman), Guerulfus (medieval Latin), Lobarraz
(Portuguese), Lobis-homem (Portuguese), Lobi-
zon, Lope-kummari (in Abruzzi), Loup-garou
(French), Loup-varous (in Picardy), Lupe-pa-
naru (in Aquileia), Lupu menare (in Naples),
Lupu-minare (in Calabria), Lupu-minaru (in
Sicily), SKINWALKER, Vaerulf (Danish), Varulf
(Swedish), Werwulf (German).
Physical description: Luminous yellow eyes.
Sometimes tailless.
Behavior: Nocturnal. Bipedal. Uses front
paws as hands. Uses an ointment (said to con-
tain hemlock, aconite, bufogenin, or other hal-
lucinogenic substances) in order to shape-shift
into a wolf.
Significant sightings: Lykaion, the legendary
king of Arcadia, Greece, sacrificed his baby son
in a bloody ritual and was turned into a wolf by
Zeus for his crime.
Herodotus wrote in the fifth century B.C. that
the Neuri of Scythia (possibly the Milograd cul-
ture that flourished near Chernobyl, Ukraine)
changed into wolves for a few days every year.
The first writer to identify lycanthropy as a
disease was Marcellus Sidetes, the Greek author
of a medical poem who lived in Manavgat,
Turkey, in the second century A.D. He consid-
ered it a form of melancholia in which the suf-
ferer is deluded into thinking he is a wolf and
lingers in cemeteries.
One night in July 1958, Mrs. Delburt Gregg
saw a shaggy, wolflike creature clawing at her
window screen in Greggton, Texas. It had fangs
and glowing, slitted eyes. She shined a flashlight
at it in time to see it run away into some bushes.
Later, a tall man emerged and walked away
down the road.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Gray wolf ( Canis lupus) was one of
the first wild animals to be domesticated.
The process of adopting young wolves by
hunter-gatherer groups as companions in
the hunt and as guard animals probably
occurred in several places as early as 10,000
B.C. Close bonding and mutual dependence
with an animal undoubtedly had great
magical significance, and those individuals
who took on the attributes of a wolf would
be seen as skilled hunters and shamans. The
earliest shape-shifting myths may well have
Neolithic roots.
(2) Lycanthropy is recognized as a
psychopathological illness in which an
individual imagines he or she is a wild beast
and develops a taste for raw or rancid meat.
The individual may howl like a wolf, run
naked through the woods, and attempt to
rape or kill young girls. Historical cases,
such as the serial killer Peter Stubb (or
Stumpf) of Koln, Germany, tried in 1589,
584 WEREWOLF
were taken seriously and treated with a
harshness that was severe even for the time.
Such a mental illness could be triggered by
many different situations, including famine,
plague, war, economic disaster, or substance
abuse. In at least one case investigated in
1975, this condition was the result of
persistent drug abuse.
(3) Weird behavior can be induced by eating
rye or other grains infected with the ergot
fungus ( Claviceps purpurea or C. paspali). In
the Middle Ages, infected rye was often sent
to the mill accidentally. Entire towns would
eat bread made from the flour and suffer
intoxication from a hallucinogenic alkaloid in
the fungus. These psychotic episodes were
known as ignis sacer (holy fire) or St.
Anthony’s fire because St. Anthony was the
patron saint of a religious order founded to
care for ergotism victims. It has been
suspected that the Greek cult of Eleusis was
based on ingestion of ergot to attain
enlightenment. Physical effects of ergotism
include frothing at the mouth, uncontrollable
rage, constriction of the vocal cords causing
barking or howling, a burning sensation in
the skin, and a feeling of tremendous
excitement. Shape-shifting hallucinations
during an ergotism outbreak could easily have
contributed to the Werewolf mythos.
(4) Leon Illis has suggested that the
condition of congenital porphyria could be
the origin of some Werewolf beliefs.
Porphyria involves a failure of the bone
marrow to form properly. Its symptoms
include an aversion to sunlight, tissue
destruction of the face and fingers, skin
lesions, and a reddish-brown pigmentation
on the teeth. Sometimes, excessive facial
hair and deranged behavior are displayed.
However, porphyria patients do not appear
or behave particularly wolflike.
(5) Humans infected by rabies could
account for some cases, though this disease
and its symptoms were well known in the
Middle Ages.
(6) Cults or tribes that dressed in wolf- or
bearskins did so in order to take on the
boldness, cunning, and ferocity of a wild
animal. There is some evidence that a
Greco-Roman cult of lycanthropy existed in
Britain by the first century A.D. German
and Scandinavian followers of Odin called
berserkers would consume alcohol and
commit violent acts.
(7) Accounts of feral children ( Homo
FERUS ), allegedly raised in the woods by
wolves or other wild animals, have
undoubtedly added to the legend. The
infants Romulus and Remus, the legendary
founders of Rome, were said to have been
nursed by a female wolf in a cave on the
Palatine Hill until they were discovered by a
shepherd.
(8) A literary and cinematic myth representing
the fear of reverting to the bestial.

deer (M. gouazoubira ) .
Distribution: Rio Aripuana, Mato Grosso
State, Brazil.
Significant sighting: Marc van Roosmalen

Possible explanation: A regional variation of
the gray brocket deer, which has a white belly in
the north of its range and a gray belly in the
south.

Whitey
Freshwater Monster of Arkansas.
Etymology: From the river.
Physical description: Length, 10-36 feet.
Weight, more than 1,000 pounds. Smooth, gray
skin. Long, pointed object (a beak?) on the fore-
head. Spiny backbone.
Behavior: Creates a bubbly disturbance in the
water. Tail constantly thrashes. Makes a sound
between a cow’s moo and a horse’s neigh.
Tracks: Length, 14 inches long. Width, 8
inches. Three clawed toes. Pads on the heel and
toes. Some show a spur extending from the heel.
Distance between prints, 8 feet.
Distribution: White River, near Newport,
Arkansas.
Significant sightings: Plantation owner Bram-
blett Bateman saw a 12-foot, gray thing emerge
from a “deep hole” some 60 feet deep in the
river, near Newport, on July 1, 1937. It floated
a few minutes on the surface, then submerged.
He saw it again on September 22. As many as
twenty-five other residents, including two
deputy sheriffs, saw something that made a lot
of bubbles and foam in the river that summer.
On June 28, 1971, south of the White River
bridge, Cloyce Warren took a photograph of an
animal that had been seen for about ten days. It
shows a nondescript object disappearing be-
neath the water.
Ollie Ritcherson and Joey Dupree were boat-
ing on the river July 21, 1971, looking for the
586 WEWIWILEMITA MANETU
monster when something lifted their boat up-
ward out of the water. Sightings continued
through August.
R. C. McClauglen and his family watched an
animal thrash in the river for five minutes near
Jacksonport on June 5, 1972.
Possible explanations:
(1) A stray Southern elephant seal
(. Mirounga leonina ), according to Roy
Mackal. However, these bulky, 15-foot seals
are found in the southern Atlantic and
Pacific Oceans surrounding Antarctica,
though individuals have been found as far
north as the equator.
(2) A large Lake sturgeon ( Acipenser
fulvescens ), with olive-gray coloration and
scutes along its back and sides, can grow to
9 feet long. However, Whitey’s skin was
described as smooth.
(3) A large catfish, possibly a Blue catfish
(. Ictalurus furcatus ), which can grow to more
than 5 feet long.
(4) The American alligator ( Alligator
mississippiensis) is found in this part of
Arkansas, especially in areas where it has
been restocked and reintroduced. It may
account for some sightings of 10- to 15-foot
animals.
(5) Hoaxed tracks, though some were found
in unlikely spots.
(6) A giant penguin, suggested by Ivan T.
Sanderson, based on the alleged similarity of
the tracks with Three-Toes in Florida.

WILDMEN
In this category are included seventy-two types
of human-sized (5 feet— 6 feet 6 inches tall),
hairy, bipedal humans that may represent the
survival of hominid species other than modern
Homo sapiens. A widespread tradition of such
creatures exists on five continents, especially in
Asia, which is home to more than half of the
named varieties. North America is conspicu-
ously absent, although it has GlANT HOMINIDS,
Hairy Bipeds, and North American Apes in
abundance.
A surviving group of Neanderthals ( Homo ne-
anderthalensil) might account for some Wild-
man sightings. These cold-adapted archaic hu-
mans lived in Europe as far west as Britain and
in Asia as far east as Uzbekistan during the Late
Pleistocene, 100,000-30,000 years ago. Their
physical characteristics included a flat, low cra-
nium; a bulging occipital lobe at the back of the
skull; enlarged, broad nostrils; swept-back
cheekbones; large teeth, especially the incisors;
strong jaws; no chin; strong musculature; and
thick bones. The average height for males was 5
feet 6 inches and for females 5 feet 3 inches.
Males weighed more than 140 pounds, while fe-
males were lighter, at 110 pounds. Neanderthal
cranial capacity was greater than ours, averaging
more than 1,450 milliliters (modern humans
average 1,300 milliliters). There is good evi-
dence that they buried their dead, cared for dis-
abled individuals, communicated in a limited
way, hunted large animals, and produced prim-
itive stone tools (Mousterian culture). Nean-
derthals probably originated in Europe from ar-
chaic humans of the Middle Pleistocene,
350,000-150,000 years ago, perhaps repre-
sented by the fossils found at Swanscombe in
England, Steinheim in Germany, and
Fontechevade in France. Though not currently
WILDMEN 587
considered ancestral to modern humans, the
two groups did coexist for several thousand
years and probably had some cultural or genetic
exchanges. Asian Neanderthal fossils have been
found in Israel, Syria, Iraq, Ukraine, and
Uzbekistan. Although Mousterian toolkits have
been discovered elsewhere, these were not exclu-
sively Neanderthal and may have been produced
by early modern humans.
Another leading Wildman candidate is Homo
erectus , an early human that evolved in Africa
about 2 million years ago, then spread into Asia
and parts of Europe. The first fossil was found
at Trinil in Indonesia by Eugene Dubois in
1890 and was known for a long time as
Pithecanthropus erectus or Java man. More ex-
tensive material was discovered in Zhoukoudian
Cave, near Beijing, China, in the 1920s and in
Sangiran and other Javan sites in the 1930s and
later. Since then, evidence for an erectus pres-
ence has been found in Algeria, Morocco, Tan-
zania, Kenya, Georgia, and Western Europe.
Possibly the most recent erectus artifacts and re-
mains come from Selungur Cave, Kyrgyzstan,
and are dated at 125,000 years ago. Erectus
skulls are long and low, with heavy browridges
and large jaws. Cranial capacity spanned from
800 to 1,000 milliliters. Evidence from East
Africa indicates erectus had a slender, upright
frame and stood around 5 feet 7 inches tall.
Most reported Wildmen seem to be more
primitive physically and culturally than modern
Homo sapiens , represented by the Cro-Magnon
culture in Europe. There have been many finds
of jaws, skulls, and other skeletal material that
show apparent transitional forms between
Homo erectus and sapiens. Characteristics are
usually described in comparison to erectus fos-
sils (less prognathism, reduced robusticity,
lightened browridges). Cranial capacity ranges
from 1,000 to 1,400 milliliters. European spec-
imens include the Mauer mandible from Ger-
many (sometimes characterized as H. heidelber-
gensis) and the Petralona, Greece, cranium,
which shows both erectus characteristics and
more advanced features. Other fossils have been
found in Azerbaijan, Morocco, Ethiopia, South
Africa, Tanzania, India, Indonesia, Siberia
(Denisova Cave), and China. Collectively
called “archaic Homo sapiens ’ fossils, there is
too much variation to assign them a species
name; some indeed may turn out to be erectus
or sapiens. Very little postcranial material has
been discovered, so it is difficult to specify
height or weight. Few of these fossils have been
precisely dated, but they are thought to occur
within the Middle Pleistocene, 500,000-
200,000 years ago.
Homo habilis was an early East African ho-
minid contemporary with the apelike yet up-
right australopiths in the Late Pliocene, 1.9-1. 6
million years ago. Although it had a larger cra-
nium (610 milliliters on average), smaller teeth,
and a more humanlike foot skeleton, it only
weighed an average of 66 pounds and looked
more australopithecine than human.
Notice that all the preceding types are from
the Old World. There is no evidence at all that
humans evolved anywhere in the Americas. A
flourishing of early primates took place in
North America from 66 to 28 million years ago,
but these had either disappeared or moved into
South America by 27 million years ago as the
ancestors of the New World monkeys. Fully
modern humans were the next visitors to the
Americas some 40,000 years ago, leaving no
known explanation for American BlGFOOT and
CANNIBAL Giant traditions unless they fol-
lowed the Bering land bridge from Asia like the
Paleo-Indians.

Windigo
Originally, a Native American name for a CAN-
NIBAL GlANT in northern North America. Now
more commonly known as a supposed psycho-
logical compulsion to eat human flesh, said to
occur among the Algonquian peoples of Canada
and called “Windigo psychosis.” The craving is
said to be brought on by desperate cannibalism
during a famine. The reality of this syndrome
has been challenged, though the condition may
in fact have been used in the past as an excuse to
expel or execute an outcast. In recent decades,
“turning Windigo” most likely refers to an emo-
tional display of grief or worry that betrays a fear
of being lost or otherwise ill equipped to deal
with a harsh, subarctic environment. Some sto-
ries may also involve BlGFOOT wandering out-

Winged Cat
Domestic or feral Cat with apparent wings.
Variant name: Pauca billee (Hindi, Pankha
billi, “winged cat”).
Physical description: Otherwise normal cat
with winglike extensions of fur growing from its
back.
Behavior: In some cases, the cats are said to
use the wings to make flying or at least gliding
jumps.
Significant sightings: In India in the 1860s,
Alexander Gibson shot a Winged cat whose
dried skin was exhibited at a meeting of the
Bombay Asiatic Society.
In 1899, Strand Magazine carried a photo-
graph of a cat belonging to a woman in Wivelis-
combe, Somerset, England, that had two fur-
covered growths coming out of its back. They
flapped about whenever the cat moved.
In June 1949, a cat with a wingspan of 23
inches was shot and killed in northern Sweden
after it rushed at a child.
On June 24, 1966, Jean-Jacque Revers shot a
cat with a wingspan of 14 inches that was at-
tacking other animals near Alfred, Ontario. It
was said to be able to make gliding jumps of
50-60 feet with wings extended. A veterinarian
determined that the wings were long growths of
thick, matted, black fur. An autopsy confirmed
that it had been rabid.
Possible explanation: According to Karl
590 WINGED CAT
Shuker, Domestic cats ( Felis silvestris catus) with
a rare condition known as feline cutaneous as-
thenia (FCA) have abnormally loose skin that
stretches easily along the shoulders or back. This
can result in the creation of furry outgrowths
like wings.

Wolf Deer
Mystery animal of the midwestern United
States with characteristics of both a Dog and a
deerlike HOOFED Mammal.
Physical description: Larger than a dog.
Weight, 50-60 pounds. Short, red-brown hair.
Deerlike head. Small, pointed ears. Thin legs
like a deer. Bushy black tail like a horse’s.
Behavior: Apparently unafraid of humans or
guns.
Distribution: Western Oklahoma and western
Minnesota.
Significant sightings: In 1951, Mrs. Lawrence
592 WOADD-EL-UMA
Laub saw a “cross between a wolf and a deer” on
her ranch near Calumet, Oklahoma. She threw
a stick at it, but it wouldn’t run away. Neigh-
bors reported strange tracks.
On March 21, 1971, D. R. Clark and H. H.
Christensen were driving 8 miles northwest of
Canby, Minnesota, when they spotted an odd-
looking deer near Florida Creek. Clark got out
of the car, yelled, and waved his arms, but the
animal ignored him. He fired shots near it, but
it only walked a few feet away and lay down.
Present status: Only two known sightings.
Possible explanation: A bizarrely deformed
deer.

Woolly Cheetah
Unrecognized big Cat of South Africa.
Scientific name: Felis lanea , proposed by
Philip L. Sclater in 1 8 77.
Physical description: Like the common chee-
tah but with a thicker body and tail and shorter
limbs. Woolly, dense fur. Covered with
roundish brown blotches instead of spots. “Tear
line” missing around eye. Nonretractile claws.
Distribution: Great Karoo, Western Cape
Province, South Africa; Lebombo Mountains,
Swaziland.
Significant sightings: In 1877, Philip Sclater
announced that the London Zoo had acquired
an unusual-looking male cheetah from Beaufort
West, South Africa. It had stouter limbs and a
thicker tail than a normal cheetah. Sclater
recorded receiving a similar skin in 1884, again
from Beaufort West, that was smaller and al-
most as densely furred.
Possible explanation: A genetic mutation of
the common Cheetah (. Acinonyx jubatus ) that
may be a species adaptation in progress. Lena
Bottriell has suggested a partial albino morph.
Others have suggested an erythritic or chinchilla
albino morph.

Wooo-Wooo
Giant Owl of New Jersey.
Etymology: From its call.
Behavior: Call is a “WOOoo WOOoo
WOOoo.”
Distribution: Northwestern New Jersey.
Significant sightings: In June 1965, Ivan T.
Sanderson and Walter McGraw heard a loud
“WOOoo” cry repeated at Sanderson’s farm-
house near Columbia, New Jersey. It grew in in-
tensity, then faded away. They thought it was
coming from a bird flying along Kittatinny
Mountain. Another call came from the other
side of the Delaware River.

Wudewasa
WlLDMAN of Europe, often depicted in me-
dieval art, sculpture, heraldry, drama,
pageantry, and allegorical fiction.
Etymology: Old English, “wood man,” from
wold (“forest”) + wasan (“being”). An alternative
suggestion is that wasa derives from vuassar
(“from Asia”). The English surnames Wood-
house and Wodehouse are said to originate from
this word.
Variant names: Callicantzari (Greek), Fangge
(in the Alps), Fanke, Green man, GRENDEL, Gru-
agach (Irish), Hazessa (Saxon), Holzmoia (Ger-
man), Holzwib, Homine agreste, l’Homme
sauvage (French), Homo silvestris (Latin), Jehan

(in the Tyrol), Noerglein (in the Tyrol), Ogre
(French), Oreo (Italian), Orke (in the Tyrol),
Orson, Ozruti (Slovak), Pilosus (Latin), Salvan

man), Scinlac (Anglo-Saxon), Simiot (Catalan),
Skogsra (Swedish), Tristan de Nanteuil, Walt

with, Wodehouse, Wodemwose, Wodewese,
Wodewose, Wodwos, Wodwose, Woodwose,
Wudewasan, Wudu wasa, Zruty (Slovak).
Physical description: Humanlike but naked
and covered in hair. Some traditions depict a
giant; others, especially in Germany, involve hu-
mans as short as 2 feet tall. Long head-hair. Fe-
male has pendulous breasts. Feet and hands are
hairless and humanlike. Sometimes shown with
a tail.
Behavior: Eats berries, acorns, and raw meat.
Lives in a hollowed-out tree trunk or cave. Car-
ries a club or crude log. Sometimes depicted as
wearing a leaf garment. No knowledge of metals
or agriculture. Said to abduct women and eat
unbaptized infants.
Habitat: Remote forests or mountains.
Distribution: Primarily the Alps and other
mountains of Central Europe, though pageantry
and artistic depictions percolated throughout
the continent. Recent sightings of European
WlLDMEN have occurred in Sweden, Germany,
and Italy.
Significant sightings: In Chretien de Troyes’s
romance Yvain (twelfth century), a knight runs
across a giant Wildman in the enchanted forest
of Broceliande in Brittany, France. It is oversee-
ing a fight between two Aurochs ( Bos primige-
nius).
One of the earliest artistic depictions of a
Wudewasa is on the north portal of the mid-
thirteenth century church in Semur-en-Auxois,
Cote d’Or Department, France, which shows a
Wildman holding the arm of a man who is
counting money into a sack.
Two different types of Wildmen are featured
in terra-cotta carvings from the ruins of a castle
on Schlossberg outside Homburg, Saarland
State, Germany. One seems to depict a hairy,
feral human, while the other type is more ape-
like, with an upturned nose.
In fifteenth-century France, the “savage man”
was personified by the legendary Orson (French,
“little bear”), the twin brother of Valentine and
son of Bellisant. Carried off and raised by a bear,
Orson became known as the “wild man of the
forest” when he grew up and was depicted in
many contemporary illustrations.
On August 18, 1644, Elector Johann Georg I
of Saxony captured a 2-foot-tall female near
Chemnitz, Germany.
In 1691, a young man in Sweden was accused
of having sexual relations with a Skogsra, or
Wild woman, and condemned to death.
Several hairy Wild women were seen in the
neighborhood of Groditsch, Brandenburg State,
Germany, around 1735.
In November 1938, two apes or monkeys
were seen on several occasions playing in trees
around Neubrandenburg, Mecklenburg-Vor-
pommern State, Germany. No zoo escapees
were reported.
Jan-Ove Sundberg has gathered reports of a
Swedish BlGFOOT from Gavleborg County,
south and west of Bollnas. In 1985, a woman at
a recreation area near Voxna was cleaning out
her family cabin when she heard someone
prowling around outside. Terrified, she hid
under the bed. Later, she found numerous hu-
manlike footprints outside the house that meas-
ured 18 inches long by 12 inches wide. A few
weeks later, two teenage girls skinny-dipping in
a pond saw a large ape in the bushes along the
shore. It had a terrible stench, pounded its
chest, and growled at them. They swam ashore
farther down and ran through the woods with-
out their clothes until they reached home, a few
kilometers away. Scared and covered with
scratches, they swore the creature wasn’t a bear.
A hairy giant with a short, thick neck was re-
ported in the area around Ventimiglia, Liguria,
Italy, by Swiss music producer Jean Singgelos and
others between December 1996 and July 1997.
Present status: Often seen in medieval art and
church sculptures. Some 200 European families
have a Wildman or Wudewasa as heraldic
emblems.
Possible explanations:
(1) Absorption of the Greek SATYR myth by
medieval Christian iconography.
594 WUDEWASA
(2) Continuance in popular culture of the
“monstrous races” (such as the
Kynokephalos or Sciapod) as described by
Pliny and other classical authors.
(3) Representations of apes from Africa and
Indonesia, although these weren’t known in
Europe until the seventeenth century.
(4) Depictions of feral people who, for
various reasons, reverted to a wild,
uncivilized state. In the Middle Ages and
continuing into our own times, many
homeless, eccentric, heretical, criminal, or
mentally unstable individuals have sought
refuge outside of society. Abandoned
children sometimes had to survive as best
they could in the forest. Some famous cases
include the wolf child of Hesse, Germany
(1344); the bear girl of Horn, Hungary,
who was taken to the hospital in Krupina,
Slovakia (1767); the wild man of Ivary
forest in the Pyrenees (1774); the wild boy
of Kronstadt (Brasov, Romania, 1781); and
the wild boy of Aveyron, France (1798).
The wild state came to symbolize a
repudiation of Christianity and a rejection
of the divine order — a temporary condition,
it was hoped, amenable to rehabilitation so
that social structures could be vindicated.
(5) Folk memory of Neanderthals ( Homo
neanderthalensis) or other early hominids
who coexisted with modern Europeans in
ancient or medieval times.

Wyoming Mummy
SMALL Hominid of western North America.
Variant name: Pedro.
Physical description: Height, 6.5 inches sit-
ting; 14 inches estimated total. Weight, 0.75
pound. Dark-brown, wrinkled skin. Gray head-
hair. Flat head. Flat nose. Wide mouth with full
lips. Pointed teeth. Thick arm-hair. Spatular
fingernails.
Distribution: Pedro Mountains, Wyoming.
Significant sighting: In October 1932, two
prospectors, C. Main and F. Carr, came across a
small cave in the Pedro Mountains, Carbon
County, Wyoming, in which a little, mummi-
fied man was sitting on a ledge. They kept it
with them for two years, wrapped in a sack; after
that, it was obtained by Floyd Jones of Casper,
Wyoming, who exhibited it in the 1930s, and
then Ivan P. Goodman, who exhibited it in the
1940s. At some point, it was allegedly brought
to anthropologist Harry L. Shapiro at the Amer-
ican Museum of Natural History, who exam-
ined it for a month. X rays proved it had a
human skeleton, and there was a suggestion of
undigested food in the stomach. The bones of
the right shoulder apparently were broken, and
the spine had been injured. Goodman died in
1950, and the mummy passed into the hands of
Leonard Waller, after which it was lost some-
time in the 1970s.
Probable explanation: An infant or fetus with
anencephaly, a congenital anomaly producing
an absence of all or part of the brain, suggested
by Rainer Zangerl and D. Dwight Davis, who
examined the mummy in March 1950. They
suspected it had been buried no more than
twenty-five years. It may also have been “en-
hanced” for exhibition.

Xing-Xing
Unknown PRIMATE of Central Asia. In earlier
times, apparently used for WlLDMEN or Yeti.
Etymology: Chinese (Sino-Tibetan), “orang-
55 CC 55
utan or ape.
Variant name: Hsing-hsing.
Physical description: Apelike. White, human-
like face. Pointed ears.
Behavior: Bipedal. Arboreal. Call is like a
child’s cry. Capable of speech. Fond of wine.
Distribution: A large ravine in remote Xin-
jiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China, may
have been named after this ape. Called Xing-
xingxia (Ape Ravine), it is situated at 41° 48' N,
95° 09' E. A different intonation of Xingxing in
Mandarin means “stars,” and geographers prefer
the latter derivation. However, there is an old
tradition that man-eating apes would drink
from the river that used to flow through the
ravine.

Xipe
SMALL Hominid of Central America.
Etymology: Possibly related to Xipe Totec, the
Aztec god of agriculture and rebirth, whose
priests wore the flayed skin of sacrificial victims.
In Nahuatl, Xipe originally meant either “the
flayed one” or “he with the penis.”
Variant names: Xiximique.
Physical description: Monkeylike. Height, 2-4
feet. Covered with hair. Its feet face backward.
Habitat: Caves.
Distribution: Nicaragua.
Significant sightings: In 1968, a group of peas-
ants trapped a Xipe in a cave and killed it by set-
ting fire to the scrub outside.
In November 1990, some fishermen saw a
hairy humanoid emerge from the waters of El
Palacio Lake, north of Matagalpa, Nicaragua.

Y
Yabalik-Adam
WlLDMAN of Central Asia.
Etymology: Unknown, probably a Turkic
word, presumed to mean “wild man.”
Variant names: Yaboi-adam, Yavan-adam,
Yavo-khafg.
Physical description: Yellowish body hair.
Thumb is close to the fingers. Feet are broader
than a human’s.
Behavior: Moves easily in the mountains.
Turns around to face its pursuers, uttering gut-
tural cries. Chinese informants claim that it
hurls large stones as weapons and moults in
April.
Distribution: Pamir and Kunlun Mountains,
in the area where Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and
the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of
China meet.
Significant sighting: Around 1912, hunters
captured a wildman in the mountains, brought
it into a village, and fed it raw meat. After the
news reached Taxkorgon, Chinese authorities
came and took the creature away.

Yagmort
WlLDMAN of Northern Europe.
Etymology: Komi-Zyrian (Uralic), “pine forest
man.”
Physical description: Light gray body-hair.
Height, 5 feet 6 inches-6 feet 6 inches tall.
Glowing eyes. Females have large, pendulous
breasts. Arms are longer than a human’s.
Behavior: Swims. Has a consonantal lan-
guage. Can mimic human voices. High-pitched,
metallic laughter. Sleeps in caves. Fond of
horses, sometimes visiting stables. Apparently
can make fire from pounding stones.
Tracks: Humanlike and flat-footed, 12.5
inches long, 5 inches wide in the ball area, and
4 inches wide at the heel. Stride, 3 feet. Tips of
toes incline downward as if clutching the earth.
Distribution: Komi Republic south through
the Perm’ and Kirov regions, Russia.
Significant sightings: In 1920, some villagers
of Ust’-Tsil’ma, Komi Republic, Russia, were
stacking hay near the Tsil’m River when they
saw two humanlike figures. One was small and
black, the other was gray and white and nearly 7
feet tall. They ran off, the smaller one seemingly
chasing the larger one.
Fourteen-year-old Alexander Katayev
watched, at close range, a male and female
Wildman eating and talking by the Chusovaya
River in August 1974. The female was pregnant,
and they were eating something from a birch-
bark container. When they were done, they
swam across the river and climbed a steep cliff.
In August 1986, a Yagmort opened the door
of a hut in which Valentin Lytkin and other
haymowers were sleeping, in the Timenskoye
Ridge area, Komi Republic.
Two groups of hunters reported sighting a
YETI near Sovetsk, Kirov region, in August
1999. Other sightings have prompted the Kirov
regional environmental agency to take an inter-
est in this cryptid.

Yahoo
WlLDMAN of Australia. Usually equated with
the YOWIE, the term that displaced it in the
1970s, though Graham Joyner considers Yahoo
to be a more authentic name and discounts late-
twentieth-century reports.
Etymology: Australian word for “devil” or “evil
spirit,” according to James Holman. In the
Snowy Mountains region of Victoria, the Abo-
rigines refer to a songbird, the Gray-crowned
babbler ( Pomatostomus temporalis ), as the
Yahoo. Place-names (Yahoo Peak, Yahoo Val-
ley) occur in areas where the Yowie is said to
exist. Another source claims that escaped con-
victs from Botany Bay used to steal food by
rushing into camps shouting “Yarhoo!” and
scaring away the Aborigines.
Aborigines may have picked up this term
from white Australians, possibly deriving it
from Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels, first
published in 1726, in which he described a fic-
tional race of primitive men. (Isaac Asimov has
speculated that Swift got the name from the
Yagua people of Peru, known in Swift’s time as
wards of the Jesuits.) The term could be trans-
ferred to any more primitive race, including the
Aborigines themselves. Joyner has pointed out
that in 1814, an Orangutan ( Pongo pygmaeus)
was exhibited in London as “the Great Yahoo or
Wild Man of the Woods.”
Variant names: Boorong, Debil-debil, Devil-
devil, Yaahoo, Yah-hoo, Yahor, Yahu. See also
Yara-Ma-Yha-Who, Yeho.
Distribution: Queensland; New South Wales;
Tasmania.

Yamamaya
Unknown Cat of Japan.
Etymology: Yaeyama (Japanese) word.
Physical description: Size of a sheepdog. Has
tigerlike stripes.
Distribution: Iriomote-jima in the Ryukyu Is-
lands, Japan.
Possible explanations:
(1) An unrecorded subspecies of Tiger
(. Panthera tigris ), known in southern China
though rapidly declining.
(2) An insular subspecies of Clouded
leopard ( Neofelis nebulosa ), suggested by
C. A. W. Guggisberg, also known from
southern China.
(3) A striped variety of the smaller Iriomote
cat ( Prionailurus iriomotensis) , which is
spotted or banded.

602 YAHOO
Yana Puma
Mystery big Cat of South America.
Etymology: Quechua (Quechuan), “black
mountain lion.”
Physical description: Twice the size of a jaguar.
Entirely black. Large, greenish eyes.
Behavior: Passive in the day. Hunts at night.
Roars. Said to pursue and attack humans at
night.
Habitat: Mountainous forests at an altitude
of 1,600-5,000 feet.
Distribution: Central mountains of Peru.
Possible explanations:
(1) Melanistic Jaguar ( Panthera onca :),
though the reported size does not match.
Black jaguars are rare, and their spots are
always visible at certain angles.
(2) Melanistic Puma ( Puma concolor ),
though black pumas are virtually unknown.
Its rain forest coloration sometimes ranges
to a dark red-brown. Pumas do not roar,
however.

Yaquaru
Water Tiger of South America.
Etymology: Guarani (Tupi) word.
Variant names: Yaguaro, Yaquiaruig.
Physical description: Otterlike. Woolly hide.
Size of an ass. Dark brown. Long head. Erect
ears. Sharp nose. Strong tusks. Thick, short legs.
Powerful claws. Long, tapering tail.
Behavior: Rests on riverbanks. Favors deep
water and the confluence of two rivers. Said to
attack cattle and horses, dragging them into the
water.
Distribution: Paraguay; southern Argentina.
Significant sighting: In 1752, Thomas Falkner
got a glimpse of this large animal on the Rio
Parana, Argentina, as it plunged into the river.
Possible explanations:
(1) The size, claws, and aquatic habits
resemble those of the Jaguar (Panthera
onca), though it is primarily terrestrial. The
tusks and woolly coat do not match. Jaguars
still are found in Paraguay and may have
ranged to southern Argentina in prehistoric
times.
(2) A surviving Saber-toothed cat
(. Smilodon ) that adapted to an amphibious
lifestyle, representing the South American
equivalent of the African WATER LlON.
Possibly sexually dimorphic, with the
MAIPOLINA the female, suggested by Karl
Shuker.
(3) The Neotropical otter ( Lontra
longicaudis) is called “water cat” or “water
tiger” in Panama and French Guiana. It has
a dark-brown body 21-32 inches long, with
a tapering tail that is 1 5-22 inches in
length. The legs are short and stout. A
graceful swimmer, this otter feeds chiefly on
fish and crustaceans.

Yara-Ma-Yha-Who
Mystery PRIMATE of Australia.
Etymology: Kuri (Australian) word.
Physical description: Height, 4 feet. Covered
with red hair. Huge forehead and mouth.
Toothless. Jaws unhinge like a snake’s. Suckers
on its hands and feet.
Behavior: Has a slow, wobbling gait. Drops
on people from trees. Attacks children with its
suckers. Sucks the blood of a victim, swallows it
whole, jiggles its own body to make sure it goes
down, then vomits it up again; the victim is
often still living.
Habitat: Fig trees.
Distribution: New South Wales.
YARA-MA-YHA-WHO 603
Possible explanation: An Australian occurrence
of a species of Tarsier ( Tarsius spp.), a genus of
Southeast Asian primates roughly 5 inches in
length, with a tail twice as long. The toes on all
four feet are slender and expanded at the tips to
form suckerlike pads. It moves through the trees
at night by taking short leaps. Tarsiers have
never been found in Australia, but legends car-
ried by emigrants from Indonesia or the Philip-
pines in ancient times might have contributed.

Yeho
WlLDMAN of the West Indies.
Etymology: Probably of African origin, per-
haps from the Aja-Gbe (Niger-Congo) yahue or
the Kambari (Niger-Congo) yoho, both of
which mean “devil.” See also YAHOO.
Variant names: Whahoo, Yahoo, Yay-hoo.
Physical description: Covered with hair. Bear-
like claws. Feet said to point backward.
Behavior: Nocturnal. Mates with women and
produces hairy babies.
Distribution: Fresh Creek on Andros Island;
Long Island, Bahamas.

Yellow-Belly
A category of Sea MONSTER identified by
Bernard Heuvelmans.
Physical description: Tadpolelike shape.
Length, 60-100 feet. Pale yellow. Large, flat
head. One black longitudinal stripe along the
spine. Black transverse bands on its sides. Im-
mense, cylindrical, tapering tail.
Behavior: Usually seen May-September.
Swims with vertical undulations.
Habitat: Prefers tropical waters.
Distribution: Indian Ocean; Pacific Ocean.
Significant sightings: On September 11, 1876,
Captain John K. Webster and surgeon James An-
derson of the steamer Nestor saw a huge, yellow
animal with distinct, black stripes in the Strait of
Malacca off the coast of Malaysia. It remained in
view about thirty minutes, moving around the
ship. They could see no fins or flippers.
A Sea monster was seen by several people off
the Dolphin Coast not far from Umhlali,
KwaZulu Province, South Africa, on October 4,
1885. It was yellow with a dark dorsal stripe,
had fins that struck the water on each side, and
appeared to be about 90 feet long.
Possible explanations: Heuvelmans suggested
an unknown type of shark or an amphibian.

Ye-Ren
Wildman of East Asia.
Etymology: Mandarin Chinese (Sino-Ti-
betan), “wild man.”
Scientific names: Pongo erectus and Yeren
sinensis , proposed by Grover S. Krantz in 1998.
Variant names: Mao-Ren, Suet-juen (Can-
tonese Chinese, “snowman”), Xue-ren (Man-
darin Chinese, “snowman”), Yeren.
Physical description: There seem to be two
basic types — one is bipedal, and the other is
quadrupedal, slightly smaller, and may be
equivalent to the REN-XlONG. Height, 4-8 feet,
with an average of 6 feet 6 inches. Greatest re-
ported height is 10 feet. Weighs as much as 500
pounds. Covered with hair, 1-4 inches long.
Color varies from black in Yunnan Province to
white in Tibet and reddish-brown in Hubei
Province; grayish-brown and yellowish-brown
has also been reported. Head is the size of a
human’s. Long head-hair, 12—21 inches long.
Hair on the front of the head stands up; on the
back it hangs down. High, sloping forehead.
Narrow face overgrown with short hair, includ-
ing the nose. Black eyes. Ears are larger than a
human’s. Nose is like an orangutan’s or a
human’s but upturned or flared. High cheek-
bones. Protruding teeth and jaws. Everted lips.
Broad shoulders (females, 3 feet wide). Females
have breasts. Waist, 18 inches across. Long, red
hair on the arms. Palms and soles are hairless.
Long hands and fingernails. Fingers are about 6
inches long. Thumb is only slightly separated.
Calves are thickset and longer than the thighs.
Feet are more than 12 inches long and 6-7
inches wide. Large buttocks. No tail.
Hair analysis: Microscopic, keratin content,
and particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE)
tests have been performed on alleged Ye-ren hair
samples. These indicate that the hairs are chem-
ically and structurally distinct from those of
known animals in comparative samples, includ-
ing humans and nonhuman primates. A higher
Chinese poster that asks, “Have you seen the wildman ?”
(Ye-ren). (Fortean Picture Library)
primate is suggested.
Behavior: Walks bipedally as well as on all
fours. Rubs against a tree to scratch its back.
Travels singly or in pairs. Runs swiftly. Cry re-
sembles a neigh or bray; also a shrill “wu, wu.”
No language. Eats berries, wild chestnuts, ten-
der stems, saplings, roots, maize, and insects.
Lives in caves. Smiles and chatters when meet-
ing a human.
Tracks: Two types: (1) 8 inches long, with big
toe separated from smaller four and pointing
outward, and (2) 12-19 inches long, with width
tapering from 4.5 inches at the toes to 2.5
inches at the heel. Toes are oval and webbed.
Length of the toes is one-fourth that of the en-
tire foot. Stride, 3-5 feet.
Habitat: Lives in the higher mountains dur-
ing the summer and moves to deciduous wood-
lands and gorges in the winter and spring.
Distribution: Primarily Sichuan and Hubei
Provinces (especially Shennongjia Forest Re-
YE-REN 605
serve), China. Also reported in Guizhou, Yun-
nan, Shaanxi, Zhejiang, Gansu, Fujian, and
Anhui Provinces.
Significant sightings: Biologist Wang Zelin
saw a Wildman that was killed by hunters near
Niangniangba, Gansu Province, in 1940. It was
a female covered with grayish-brown hair and
stood about 6 feet tall. Its face was overgrown
with hair. Its teats were reddish, suggesting it
had been breast-feeding a young one recently.
On two separate days, geologist Fan Jingquan
watched two Wildmen, a female and a young
one, as they were picking wild chestnuts near
Baoji, Shaanxi Province, in the early 1950s. The
smaller one was about 5 feet tall and bold
enough to approach closely.
In 1961, a Ye-ren was reportedly killed by
road workers in the Xishuangbanna Nature Pre-
serve area, Yunnan Province. The Chinese
Academy of Sciences conducted an investigation
and failed to obtain any direct evidence, though
sightings persist in the area.
Yin Hongfa encountered a Ye-ren in a
forested area east of Dahei Mountain, Yunnan
Province, on May 1, 1974. It stretched out its
arms to grab Yin, but he grabbed it by its head-
hair and hacked its left arm with a machete. It
ran away into the forest, leaving twenty to thirty
strands of hair in Yin’s hand.
Six officials traveling by jeep encountered a
Wildman near Chunshuya village in the Shen-
nongjia Forest, Hubei Province, at 1:00 A.M. on
May 14, 1976. They got out and started to sur-
round it, but it slipped away into the woods.
On June 6, 1977, Pang Gensheng was ap-
proached by a hairy man 7 feet 6 inches tall in
the Qinling-Taibaishan Reserve, Shaanxi
Province. They confronted each other for an
hour until Pang hit it in the chest with a stone,
whereupon it went down a gully muttering “go-
ro, go-ro.”
In 1977, the Chinese Academy of Sciences
conducted a survey of Fang County and the
Shennongjia Forest Reserve and turned up a few
footprints, head-hair, and feces. A revived inves-
tigation in 1979 and 1980 turned up the skele-
ton of a “monkey child” in neighboring Sichuan
Province, though it most likely was a deformed
human.
On October 23, 1984, a small, hairy “wild-
man” threw sand and stones at two young
women of Shuitou village near Rulin in western
Hunan Province. The next day, thirty-two peas-
ants and eleven hunting dogs tracked down and
netted the creature in a neighboring county but
not before it clawed the ear off one of its cap-
tors. The animal was exhibited in several cities
before it was turned over to the Chinese Wild-
man Research Institute and identified as a Rhe-
sus monkey ( Macaca mulatto).
Another scientific expedition to Shennongjia
Forest from April to July 1995, headed by
Wang Fangchen, recovered more hair samples,
while a further search in June 1997 turned up
hundreds of large footprints.
In August 1999, Chinese officials investigat-
ing Ye-ren sightings found giant footprints in
the Shennongjia Reserve.
Present status: In October 1994, the Chinese
government set up a scientific committee to
study Ye-ren evidence. Since 1995, the China
Travel Service in Hubei Province has offered a
large reward for a specimen, dead or alive, with
lesser prizes for photographs, hair, or feces.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Stump-tailed macaque ( Macaca
arctoides) is found from Bhutan to Vietnam.
In China, it is known to be present in
Jiangxi, Anhui, and Qinghai Provinces. It
has dark-brown hair and a hairless, red face.
A diurnal quadruped that prefers rocky
mountain environments, it often raids crops
for potatoes and rice. An outsize variety or
subspecies could account for some sightings.
See Ren-Xiong.
(2) The Golden snub-nosed monkey
( Rhinopithecus roxelland) has a thick, dark-
brown coat and light-colored hair on its
underside, ranging from orange to buff. It
has a human-looking face. The head and
body is 2 feet 6 inches long, with a tail of
roughly equal length. It lives in Tibet and
the Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, northern
Guizhou, and Hubei Provinces of China at
altitudes up to 11,000 feet. It is present in
the Shennongjia Forest. Some alleged Ye-
ren hairs probably come from this monkey.
(3) The Orangutan ( Pongo pygmaeus) was
606 YE-REN
present in China during the Pleistocene and
is thought to have persisted into historical
times. A surviving population might
account for the red-haired, quadrupedal
variety of Ye-ren.
(4) The Asiatic black bear ( Ursus thibetanus)
has long, black fur with a distinct, white V
on its chest. Some old stories about the
killing of a Wildman may actually involve
bears.
(5) A surviving Ramapithecus , an extinct
primate that lived in northern India, Kenya,
and Southern Europe in the Late Miocene,
16-5 million years ago. At once thought
ancestral to humans, Ramapithecus is now
seen as closely related to (or identical with)
Sivapithecus, ancestor to the orangutan.
Other Miocene apes probably related to the
dryopithecines are known from Gansu and
Yunnan Provinces in China.
(6) Lufengpithecus was a medium-sized
primate that lived in the Late Miocene, 9-7
million years ago. Skulls, mandibles, and
teeth have been found at the only known
site at Lufeng, Yunnan Province. Although
some have considered it close to the
orangutan lineage, its precise relationship
remains unclear.
(7) Raranthropus robustus , an australopith
that lived in South Africa 1.8-1. 5 million
years ago in the Early Pleistocene, has been
suggested as a Ye-ren candidate. However,
there is no evidence that it ever migrated to
Asia.
(8) An evolved Gigantopithecus, a huge
fossil ape that lived 1 million-500,000
years ago in China and Vietnam. It is
known only from jaw fragments and
isolated teeth. Liucheng County in
Guangxi Province has yielded three
mandibles and more than 1,000 teeth. It
had a massive jaw and low-crowned, fiat
molars with thick enamel caps adapted for
chewing coarse vegetation. Its estimated
height was 9-10 feet tall, and it could have
weighed 900-1,200 pounds. However, no
weight-bearing bones have been recovered,
and it is possible that the animal’s teeth
and jaws were disproportionate to its body
size. In any case, it seems too robust for the
Ye-ren.
(9) Homo erectus fossils are known from
many sites in China. The earliest are a
cranium and mandible dated at roughly 1
million years ago, found at Lantian in
central Shaanxi Province; a few stone tools
and possible indications of fire have been
recovered from similar strata in the area.
Other important erectus finds are the
famous Zhoukoudian fossils (Peking man)
and crania and teeth from various sites in
Hubei, Yunnan, and Sichuan Provinces.
Archaic Homo sapiens fossils have been
discovered in Dali County, Shaanxi
Province, and at Jinniushan Mountain,
Liaoning Province; these date to about
200,000 years ago.
(10) Grover Krantz has argued that the
Sangiran 4 skull found in Java in the late
1930s displays anomalies (a massive sagittal
crest, for example) that indicate it may have
belonged to an unknown bipedal orangutan,
a possible Ye-ren candidate. However, most
paleoanthropologists consider Sangiran 4 to
be within the acceptable range of Homo
erectus variation.
(11) Persons with certain birth defects or
physical deformities are known in China as
“monkey babies” and are thought to be the
result of a mating between a Wildman and
local women. Frank Poirier witnessed one of
these individuals in Xhin Xhan County,
Hubei Province. The individual was not
particularly hirsute, but he had a slouched
back and a misshapen forehead and could
not speak articulately.
(12) A composite of several different known
animals and two unknowns. Cryptids that
seem more monkey- or apelike (Lei-Lei,
Ren-Xiong, Xing-Xing) and even a Giant
hominid (Shan-Gui) also tend to confuse
the situation.

Yero
Mythical FRESHWATER MONSTER of Australia.
Etymology: Australian word.
Physical description: Eel-like. A large head
with red hair.
Behavior: Rapids emanate from its mouth.
Distribution: Lakes on the Atherton Table-
land, Queensland.
Source: Gilbert Whitley, “Mystery Animals
of Australia,” Australian Museum Magazine 7
(1940): 132-139.
Yeti
Unknown PRIMATE of Central Asia.
Etymology: Sherpa or Newari (Sino-Tibetan)
word. Said to be pronounced “yeh-tay.” Mean-
ing and origin not established, though one der-
ivation is “rock animal”: yeh (“snowy mountain”
or “rocky area”) + teh (“animal”). Another is
that teh is the same as dred (“bear”). (Interest-
ingly, in modern Tibetan, dred pa means “con-
tempt” or “disgust,” as in ABOMINABLE SNOW-
MAN.) Te can be a particle attached to a verb and
means “when,” “after,” “thus,” “although,” or
forms a gerund (“-ing”); ye has the meaning of
“primordial” or “first.” Yi dwags are Tibetan
“hungry ghosts” (one of the six classes of sen-
tient beings).
Variant names: Abominable SNOWMAN,
BAN-jHANKRI, Chelovek medvied, Chelovek
mishka (Russian, “bear man”), Chu-Mung,
Dre-Mo, Dzu-Teh, Jungli-Admi, Khya,
Metoh-Kangmi, Mi-Chen-Po, Mi-Go, Mi-
Teh, Osodrashin, Pi, RAKSHI-BOMPO, Samdja
(Tibetan, “man-animal”?), Snezhniy chelovek
(Russian, “snowman”), SOGPA, Yah- teh, Yeh-
teh.
The Sherpas in the Himalayas often speak of
two or three types of Yeti, though the classifica-
tions get blurred. Charles Stonor heard of two,
the Dzu-Teh (probably a bear) and the Ml-
Teh (the true Yeti). Tom Slick was told of the
SOGPA (the true Yeti), the Dzu-Teh (more like
a large, yak-killing bear), and the Mi-Teh (a
smaller Yeti). Panday credits a Sherpa of the
Khumbu Valley with distinguishing the Ml-
Teh (true Yeti), Dzu-Teh (large bear), and
Teh-Lma (a small Yeti or gibbon).
608 YERO
The Yeti, unknown primate of Central Asia. (Richard Svensson/Fortean Picture Library)
Scientific name: Dinanthropoides nivalis, given
by Bernard Heuvelmans in 1958. (An earlier
name, Homo nivis odiosus, given by Harold W.
Tilman in 1937, was facetious.)
Physical description: Thickset and muscular.
Height, 5 feet 6 inches-7 feet 6 inches tall.
Weight, 200-400 pounds. Covered with a thick
coat of dark grayish-brown or reddish-brown
hair. The dark Yetis are said to be larger than the
reddish ones. High, pointed head with sagittal
crest. Less hair on the face. Both white and dark
skin have been reported. Flat nose. Wide
mouth. Large teeth. Females have large breasts.
Arms reach to its knees. Large hands. Long fin-
gers. Bowed legs. Feet are plantigrade. No tail.
Scalps: The Yeti scalp at the Pangboche
Monastery, Nepal, is 7.5 inches tall, 9.75 inches
long, and 6.75 inches wide. Conical. The cir-
cumference at the base is 17.25 inches. Reddish
hair grows especially thick along a supposed
sagittal crest. The blackish skin has the texture
of brittle leather. It is said to be from a male.
The scalp at the Khumjung Monastery,
Nepal, is roughly the same size and said to be
from a female. This is the scalp borrowed by Sir
Edmund Hillary in 1960 and examined by spe-
cialists at the Field Museum in Chicago. It was
made from the skin of a Himalayan goat-ante-
lope, the Serow ( Naemorhedus sumatraensis ) .
The scalp at the Namche Bazar Monastery,
Nepal, is an obvious fake copy of others.
Mummified hands: A Yeti arm said to be at
the Makalu Monastery in Nepal consists of the
paw and forearm of a Snow leopard ( Uncia
undo).
The Pangboche Monastery hand is unusual.
In 1959, Peter Byrne was permitted to examine
the hand, from which he removed a thumb and
phalanx, replacing them with human fingers he
secretly brought with him. With the assistance
of actor James Stewart and his wife Gloria, the
real bones were smuggled to England, where
they were examined by primatologist W. C.
Osman Hill. At first, Hill thought the sample
was human, but he later changed his mind, con-
sidering it Neanderthal-like. Zoologist Charles
A. Leone was baffled, but George Agogino
thought it might be an ape’s. When Sir Ed-
mund Hillary examined the Pangboche hand in
1960 and declared it a mix of human and ani-
mal, he was looking at it after Byrne’s switch.
The current whereabouts of the pilfered sample
is unknown.
Behavior: Primarily nocturnal. Reclusive. Mi-
gratory. Walks bipedally with a sidling gait, but
sometimes runs on all fours. Sometimes slides
down snowy slopes. Sure-footed on steep or dif-
ficult ground. Females throw their breasts over
their shoulders to run. Feeds on pikas, rodents,
hares, large insects, birds, eggs, moss, and bam-
boo shoots and possibly small yaks, tahr, and
musk deer. Has apparently raided potato crops
and village wells. Can be persuaded to drink the
local beer ( chang, ). Call is a loud, gull-like yelp-
ing, mewing, or a high-pitched cry. It also chat-
ters. When angered, it will damage huts and tear
up shrubs. Makes a rough nest from dwarf ju-
niper branches. Apparently has little or no tech-
nology. At least two reports have it using bow
and arrows, although these may actually refer to
a WlLDMAN type in the same region. Stories of
Yeti-human relationships exist; some families in
Melumche and Chilankha in Nepal are said to
have been raised by a Yeti mother and a Sherpa
father, while in Tarke, there are families raised
by a Sherpa mother and a Yeti father.
Tracks: Length, 8-13 inches. Maximum
width, 4-6 inches. Large big toe is separated
from three or four smaller ones. Impression in
the snow is deeper than a human track. Trail is
a fairly straight line. Stride ranges from 1 foot 8
inches to 3 feet.
Habitat: Lives in the forest below the snow
line and in the autumn occasionally goes out in
search of food on the snowfields from 10,000 to
23,000 feet. In Sikkim State, India, it is said to
live along the Talung-Chu escarpment and
climb to an altitude of 27,900 feet.
Distribution: The Himalayan Mountains of
Nepal, Kashmir, India, and Bhutan; the south-
ern Tibetan Plateau; southern Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region of China; northwestern
Yunnan Province, China.
Significant sightings: In 1832, British minister
to Nepal Brian H. Hodgson was the first West-
erner to write about apelike creatures in the high
Himalayas, which some of his employees had
seen.
610 YETI
Laurence A. Waddell came across large foot-
prints in 1889 at an elevation of 17,000 feet in
northeastern Sikkim State, India. His Tibetan
guides said they were made by Wildmen, but
Waddell thought they were bear tracks.
In 1917, a female Yeti captured a boy from
Keronja village, near Dhading, Nepal. Accord-
ing to a story told sixty years later, their descen-
dants are said to still live there.
On September 22, 1921, Charles Howard-
Bury encountered gigantic, humanlike tracks at
an altitude above 20,000 feet in the Lhakpa La
Pass, Tibet.
In 1925, British photographer A. N.
Tombazi got a brief glimpse of a naked human
figure walking upright at an altitude of 15,000
feet near the Zemu Glacier, Sikkim State, India.
Upon reaching the spot where he had seen it, he
found fifteen small footprints with pointed
heels.
John Hunt found unidentified tracks at
19,000 feet on the Zemu Glacier, Sikkim State,
India, in 1937.
A man named Mingmah, of Pangboche,
Nepal, was tending his yaks in March 1949
when he heard a loud call. He saw it was a Yeti,
so he hid inside a stone hut nearby. Through a
chink in the stones, he could see the creature
only a few feet away. It moved around on two
legs and snarled when it saw him in the hut.
Mingmah thrust a smoldering stick from the
fire at it, and the Yeti ran away.
Monks at Thyangboche Monastery watched a
grayish-brown, 5 -foot Yeti emerge from rhodo-
dendron bushes and play in the snow in No-
vember 1949. The monks scared it away by
blowing conch shells and striking cymbals.
In December 1950, Sherpa Sen Tensing was
returning to Phortse with some companions
after attending a festival at Thyangboche when
a reddish-brown Yeti came up the trail in the
moonlight. He hid behind a boulder until the
animal passed by 25 yards away.
Eric Shipton, Sen Tensing, and Michael
Ward of the Everest Reconnaissance Expedition
found a mile-long trail of freshly made human-
like footprints at 19,000 feet on the southwest-
ern slope of Menlungtse, west of Mount Ever-
est, on November 8, 1951. Shipton’s crisp
Cast of a Yeti footprint discovered by Tom Slick in Nepal
in 1957. Length, 10 inches; width, 7 inches. Five toes
were originally visible but two became blurred in the
casting process. (Loren Coleman)
photographs of the trail and one of these tracks
next to an ice axe appeared in newspapers
around the world. The footprint was 13 inches
long and 8 inches wide, with an enormous big
toe, a second toe nearly as large, and three
smaller ones separated from the other two.
However, Shipton and Ward are said to have
admitted later that the trail had nothing to do
with the photographed Yeti print and may have
been made by an Ibex ( Capra ibex) or Hi-
malayan tahr {Hemitragus jemlahicus) .
The 1954 Daily Mail's “Yeti Expedition” to
Nepal found multiple sets of tracks in the snow
in four locations. The team included moun-
taineer John A. Jackson, journalist Ralph Izzard,
photographer Tom Stobart, zoologists Charles
Stonor and Biswamoy Biswas, and naturalist
Gerald Russell. On January 8, Stonor found
some 10-inch-long, humanlike tracks at an alti-
tude of 14,000 feet west of Namche Bazar on
YETI 611
the other side of the Bhote Kosi River. On Feb-
ruary 18, Jackson and photographer Stanley
Jeeves discovered three-day-old bipedal tracks
that were 10-11 inches long and 5-6 inches
wide at an altitude of 18,500 feet on the
Khumbu Glacier north of Pangboche. On Feb-
ruary 27, Russell and Izzard found a three-day-
old trail at 15,000 feet in the upper Dudh Kosi
Valley that showed the clear imprint of a big toe
and at least three smaller ones; they were 8-9
inches long and 4-5 inches wide, with a stride
of 2 feet 3 inches. They followed the trail for 8
miles and found that the original track-maker
had been joined by a second. A third trail was
discovered a few days later and followed to a
height of 18,000 feet. On March 8 and 9, Jack-
son and Stobart discovered several sets of fresh
tracks at the head of the Chola Khola Valley,
and on March 10, Sherpa Norbu collected a bag
of Yeti droppings from around Lake Masumba
that Russell analyzed to find a high percentage
of Pika ( Ochotona spp.) fur and bones. On
March 14, Izzard and Russell found more Yeti
tracks and droppings above the western fork of
the Dudh Kosi.
Texas oilman Tom Slick sponsored three Hi-
malayan expeditions in search of the snowman.
In March and April 1957, Slick and Peter Byrne
carried out a reconnaissance in the Arun Khola
Valley, during which they discovered three sets
of bipedal tracks, one of which Byrne and some
Sherpas followed for 4 miles near the Chhoyang
Khola Valley, Nepal. Slick took back a cast of a
10-inch print he had found in the mud; it was
examined by Carleton Coon, George Agogino,
and others in 1959.
The February-June 1958 Slick-Johnson
Snowman Expedition was led by Gerald Russell
and Peter and Bryan Byrne. Expedition member
Norman G. Dyhrenfurth and Sherpa Ang Dawa
discovered a cave in the upper Dudh Kosi Val-
ley that Yetis apparently used for shelter; it
yielded many droppings with pika bones and
hair. Below the snow line, Russell found evi-
dence for the small Teh-Lma. The expedition
examined and photographed the Yeti scalp and
mummified hand at the Pangboche Monastery.
Peter and Bryan Byrne’s extended Slick-spon-
sored wanderings in Nepal throughout most of
1959 constituted the third expedition. Al-
though they found some additional tracks and
droppings, their biggest coup was smuggling a
portion of the genuine Pangboche hand back to
England in January with the help of American
actor Jimmy Stewart.
Edmund Hillary’s 1960 Himalayan Scientific
and Mountaineering Expedition concluded that
Yeti tracks were distortions of human footprints
melted by the snow, that Yeti sightings by Sher-
pas were unreliable because the mountain
porters did not make a distinction between the
supernatural and the real worlds, and that all the
scalps were probably fakes.
Mountaineer Don Whillans heard odd cries
and saw a dark figure on a distant ridge while
climbing Mount Annapurna, Nepal, in March
1970. The next day, he found its tracks at
13,000 feet and watched the Yeti again for
twenty minutes through binoculars.
Edward W. Cronin Jr. and Howard Emery
came across Yeti tracks on December 17, 1972,
on a snowfield at 12,200 feet on Kongmaa
Mountain in eastern Nepal. They closely resem-
bled the prints found by Eric Shipton, were dis-
tinctly bipedal, and measured 9 inches long by
4.75 inches wide.
On July 11, 1974, a young Sherpa woman
named Lhakpa Dolma was tending yaks near
Tengboche, Nepal, when a Yeti grabbed her,
dragged her to a nearby stream, then proceeded
to attack and kill her yaks. Police arrived a few
days later and found tracks.
John Hunt and his wife discovered a row of
fresh, large, oval footprints near the Khumbu
Glacier, Nepal, in November 1978. They were
about 13.75 inches long by 6.75 inches wide.
John Whyte and John Allen found tracks, 8
inches long by 4 inches wide, in December
1979 on a mountain above the Hinku Valley,
Nepal, after hearing a piercing scream that the
Sherpas identified as a Yeti’s.
A Polish Everest expedition, headed by geo-
physicist Andrzej Zawada in March 1980,
found tracks at 18,500 feet that measured 14
inches long by 7 inches wide.
In October 1984, Tim Macartney-Snape and
Greg Mortimer found Yeti tracks near the sum-
mit of Mount Everest.
612 YETI
Yeti photographs taken by Tony Wooldridge
in the Garhwal Himalaya of Uttar Pradesh
State, India, on March 6, 1986, probably show
a rock outcrop, though primatologist John
Napier was impressed with the entire series.
Near Srlnigar, in Jammu and Kashmir State,
India, a huge, gray-haired Yeti was seen after a
loud noise was heard in the jungle on January
16, 1987.
Chris Bonington and three other moun-
taineers came across a set of day-old tracks in
April 1987 near the Menlung Glacier at 16,000
feet. They measured 12 inches by 3-4 inches
and were 4 inches deep in the snow. Bonington
spent ten weeks looking for Yeti evidence.
British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) film
producer John Paul-Davidson briefly saw the
dark shape of a creature watching him.
Biologist Arkady Tishkov of the Soviet-
Chinese Glaciological Expedition observed a
Yeti on the southeastern slope of Mount Xixa-
bangma, Tibet, for nearly an hour on Septem-
ber 22, 1991. He took several photographs, but
the distance was too far. The Yeti ran away
when it saw Tishkov approaching.
Alleged Yeti hairs and claw marks were found
in the hollow of a cedar tree in eastern Bhutan
in early 2001 by British zoologist Rob McCall,
who sent the hairs to the Oxford Institute of
Molecular Medicine, where geneticist Bryan
Sykes conducted a DNA analysis. He could not
match them with human, bear, or any other
known hair type.
Possible explanations:
(1) The Asiatic black bear ( Ursus thibetanus)
has long black fur with a distinct, white V
on its chest. It is found at altitudes up to
10,800 feet in heavily forested areas from
Afghanistan to southern China. On its hind
legs, it would stand about 5-6 feet. Its
tracks in melting snow may look like a
human’s.
(2) One Himalayan variety of the Brown
bear ( Ursus arctos isabellinus) has a pale,
reddish-brown coat and stands no more
than 6 feet 6 inches tall. It is found in
Alpine meadows between the tree line and
the snow line. Like the Asiatic black bear, it
leaves tracks that are somewhat humanlike
by putting its hind feet into the prints of its
front feet. Both bears turn their feet inward,
so that the big toes look like they are on the
outside of the foot. This bear is known as
dred mongm Tibet and as dreng mo in
Pakistan. Tibetan naturalist Liu Wulin
thinks that Yeti tracks are made by brown
bears because they do not have arches; he
also believes that brown bears have the
ability to walk upright for longer stretches
than is now suspected. This is also the
explanation favored by Reinhold Messner.
See Dre-Mo.
(3) The skin of an alleged Yeti killed by
soldiers of the rajah of Mustang, Nepal,
turned out to be that of a Sloth bear
(. Melursus ursinus ), a shy, black, shaggy bear
found in India, Nepal, and Bhutan. Other
false Yeti skins obtained by Desmond Doig
in 1959 and 1960 belong to a bluish variety
of the Brown bear ( U. a. pruinosus) with
blue-tinted brown hairs tipped with gold or
gray, found in western China and Tibet.
(4) The tracks of a Snow leopard ( Uncia
uncia ), distorted by the snow. The
individual, undistorted prints are round.
(5) The running tracks of a Gray wolf
( Canis lupus), distorted by the snow. The
individual, undistorted prints are round.
(6) Tracks of any animal in the snow are
subject to distortion by melting and
sublimation, which can occur even at night
if the atmosphere is dry and windy.
(7) Hindu ascetics ( sadhus ) on a spiritual
search, usually followers of Shiva who often
carry a trident, frequently travel to high
elevations in search of enlightenment.
Trained in the art of tumo, the mental
control of body temperature, they can live
at altitudes up to 15,000 feet. Some of their
footprints, found unexpectedly, could be
confused with Yeti tracks.
(8) The Himalayan variety of the Hanuman
langur ( Semnopithecus entellus) has a heavier
gray coat and larger whiskers compared to
lowland varieties and pale white head-hair
surrounding a black face. The head and
body are 2 feet 6 inches long. Its black tail,
3 feet 6 inches long, is held upright when
YETI 613
walking on all fours. It is found at altitudes
up to 13,000 feet in Bhutan, Nepal, India,
and China. Oliver Jones thought that a
Hanuman langur made the tracks Eric
Shipton photographed in 1951 by putting
all four of its feet down more or less at once
in the same spot; however, no tail tracks
were seen, and the prints showed distinct,
alternate left-and- right features. The
langur’s foot is generally too small and
narrow to explain Yeti tracks. However, a
langur may account for Don Whillans’s
1970 sighting.
(9) The Golden snub-nosed monkey
(Rh inop it h ecus roxellana ) has a thick, dark-
brown coat and a human-looking face. The
head and body is 2 feet 6 inches long, with
a tail of roughly equal length. It lives in
Tibet and the Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu,
northern Guizhou, and Hubei Provinces of
China at altitudes up to 11,000 feet.
(10) An unknown anthropoid ape — perhaps
from the same lineage as the Orangutan
( Pongo pygmaeus) or the fossil Sivapithecus, a
fruit-eating Miocene ape that lived 9
million years ago in southern Asia — that has
adapted to a terrestrial existence.
(11) A surviving or evolved Gigantopithecus ,
first suggested in 1952 by Bernard
Heuvelmans. This huge-jawed Pleistocene
ape lived as recently as 500,000 years ago in
southern China and Vietnam, while a
smaller species, G. giganteus, dates to 9-6
million years ago in the Siwalik Hills of
India and Pakistan. However, even now the
fossil evidence is so scanty (known only
from jaw fragments and isolated teeth) that
its appearance can only be conjectured. Its
teeth are indisputably vegetarian, which
contrasts with some of the Yeti’s habits.
(12) A surviving species of Dryopithecus ,
suggested by Mark A. Hall and Loren
Coleman. Dryopithecines were small- to
moderate-sized primates that lived in
Europe from Spain to Georgia 13-8 million
years ago in the Late Miocene. Similar fossil
teeth have been found in Gansu Province in
China and in the Siwilak Hills in Pakistan,
but no facial or postcranial bones have been
recovered. A related Late Miocene ape
found in southwestern China,
Lufengpithecus lufengensis, is known from
crushed skulls, mandibles, and teeth; its
relationship to other apes is unclear, though
it may have something to do with the
Orangutan ( Pongo pygmaeus) lineage.
(13) An unknown species of large bear that
often walks on two feet, although this
corresponds more with the varieties known
as Dzu-Teh.

Yowie
WlLDMAN of Australia.
Etymology: From the Yuwaalaraay (Aus-
tralian) yuwi (“dream spirit”). Listed in old
Aboriginal glossaries as “ghost or dream spirit.”
Variations of the term have been used along the
New South Wales coast since the 1930s. The
Mulgoa and Burragorang peoples referred to the
hairy giants as Yowies in the 1960s.
Variant names: Australian bush ape, Bugaloo
(in Tasmania), DULUGAL, Gooligah (in New
South Wales), Hairy man, JlNGARA, Koy-
orowen, Makoron koro (in Tasmania), Moolu-
wonk (in South Australia), Moomega (in New
South Wales), Noocoonah (in South Australia),
QuiNKIN, Wowee-wowee, YAHOO, Yaroma (in
New South Wales), Youree, Yowrie, Yowroo,
Yuwi.
Physical description: Powerful, thickset build.
Most common height, 5-7 feet; 8-9 feet height
is frequently reported, and 10-11 feet height is
occasionally reported. Covered in brown, tan,
white, gray, or black hair. Black skin. Dome-
shaped head. Flat face. Minimal forehead and
chin. Yellow or red eyes are deeply set. Two large
canine teeth. No neck. Broad back with huge
shoulders. Breasts not reported. Arms reach al-
most to the ankles. Arm-hair is long and shaggy.
Sharp nails or claws. Spindly legs, with calf short
in proportion to thigh. Feet, 18 inches long
(Aboriginal legends have them “turned back-
wards”). Toes are long in proportion to foot.
Behavior: Nocturnal. Solitary. Shuffling gait.
Juveniles climb trees. Screams, growls, and
grunts. Overpowering stench. Dogs seem par-
ticularly afraid of them. Can use a stick.
Tracks: Handprints show a semiopposable
thumb and little finger. Footprints often show
only three to four toes, each about 5 inches
long, with no trace of an opposed big toe. Sizes
and shapes vary widely.
Habitat: Mountains and scrubland.
Distribution: Primarily the eastern coastal
mountains from southern Queensland to north-
eastern Victoria.
Significant sightings: An animal with a human
face and feet turned backward was known to the
Aborigines in 1847.
George Osborne allegedly saw an apelike ani-
mal climb out of a tree and run away on all fours
near Avondale, New South Wales, in April
1871. It was covered in black hair except for a
tan streak from neck to abdomen, and it had
feet like an iguana’s.
William and Joseph Webb shot at a Yowie
near Flea Creek in the Brindabella Range, New
South Wales, in about 1885. Its head was set
deep between its shoulders, and it was bellowing
deeply. They didn’t know whether they hit it
because it ran away as soon as the gun went off.
Its tracks were humanlike, with spreading toes
and a long stride.
George Summerell rode up close to a gray-
haired Yowie that was drinking from a creek
near Creewah, New South Wales, on October
12, 1912; Australian poet and bushman Sydney
Wheeler Jephcott visited the spot the next day
and was able to make plaster casts of hand- and
footprints.
616 YOWIE
Cast of a supposed Yowie track made near Springbrook,
Queensland, by Andre Clayden in mid- 1998 . (Tony
Healy/Fortean Picture Library)
On August 7, 1970, Rex Gilroy was eating
lunch in a clearing near the Ruined Castle rock
formation in the Blue Mountains, New South
Wales, when a man-sized, apelike creature with
orange hair ran across the open ground and gave
out a scream.
Alwyn Richards and his sister saw a 9-foot
Yowie staring at them near Killawarra, New
South Wales, in 1974. It stepped over a 4-foot
fence without breaking stride.
On August 10, 1977, in Woodenbong,
Queensland, a woman was awakened by hearing
her dog yelping and a high-pitched screaming
outside. Only about 5 feet away from her back
door, she saw a bad-smelling, apelike creature
covered with brownish hair holding her dog
tightly to its chest. When it saw her, it dropped
the dog and backed away, watching her intently.
It made some deep grunts and then ran out into
the street, its arms hanging loose. The witness
said it was 6 feet tall, with a small head, broad
chest, narrow hips, and strong legs. Its hair was
close-cropped except on its arms and shoulders.
She had to wash her dog with antiseptic to get
the smell out. Her husband heard the grunts,
and neighbors heard the barking. One foot-
print, 8.5 inches long and slightly over 4 inches
wide at the toes, remained, along with three
strands of long, reddish hair on a fencepost.
Twenty students (one of whom later became
a senator) at Koonjewarre Campgrounds near
Springbrook, Queensland, saw a 9-foot Yowie
approach their cabin several times on October
22-23, 1977. It ripped 3-foot-tall shrubs out of
the dry ground with ease. One time, they
watched it through binoculars, and on another
occasion, it came within 30 feet of their sleeping
quarters. Trapezoidal footprints were found,
longer than 13 inches, very narrow at the heel,
and more than 7 inches wide at the toes. Other
incidents were reported in the same area for the
next five months.
Warren Christensen and Tony Solano ran
into a 9-foot Yowie while hunting pigs at Sandy
Creek near Kilcoy, Queensland, on December
28, 1979. After shooting at it, they found three-
toed tracks that were 19 inches long and 6
inches wide.
At 2 A.M. on January 2, 1987, Stella Donahue
and Bill Johnstone woke up at their campsite to
see an 8-foot ape standing waist-deep in the
water at Lake Dulverton, Tasmania.
On January 22, 1995, two boys saw an 8-9-
foot Yowie walking along a road bordering the
Ballengarra State Forest southwest of Kempsey,
New South Wales. It was massive and looked
“in between a human and a gorilla.” Sixteen
footprints 11.8 inches long and 7 inches wide
were found at the spot two weeks later.
Possible explanations:
(1) Surviving Homo erectus. No indisputably
erectus fossils have been found in Australia,
though some finds in Java are now dated to
only 40,000 years ago. H. erectus used tools
and fire, neither of which Yowies seem
familiar with. The tallest fossils are less than
6 feet, leaving them on the short end of the
Yowie scale.
(2) Surviving Kow Swamp people, an early
population of Homo sapiens known from
YOWIE 617
more than forty skeletons found in the late
1960s in a burial ground at Kow Swamp,
Victoria. Carbon-dated to only
14,000-9,000 years ago, these individuals
have robust features, large teeth and jaws,
and crania that exhibit some features
characteristic of Homo erectus (prominent
browridges, low foreheads, and even sagittal
crests in some instances). Some
anthropologists conjecture that this was due
to artificial deformation, while others
speculate that the group has descended from
an earlier erectus-sapiens hybrid. In any case,
the Kow Swamp people seem too advanced
culturally and too modern-looking to
account for the Yowie.
(3) Surviving Gigantopithecus, according to
Rex Gilroy, who claims to have found a
fossil footprint of this giant ape near
Kempsey, New South Wales. However,
Gigantopithecus lived 1 million-500,000
years ago in China, north Vietnam, and
India and is known only from jaw
fragments and isolated teeth. The absence of
a land bridge, which prevented placental
mammals from reaching Australia, would
also have been a barrier to the giant ape.
(4) Aborigines may account for a few cases.
They are capable of growing profuse beards,
though no Yowies are reported to have
them. The Aborigines themselves believe the
Yowie to be nonhuman. Malcolm Smith
cites at least two cases where hairy
Europeans were mistaken as wildmen.
(5) An unknown apelike marsupial. One
fossil candidate is the Mountain
diprotodont ( Hulitherium thomasetti ), a
Late Pleistocene marsupial with a domed
head and short muzzle discovered in Papua
New Guinea in 1986. Its mobile limbs may
have allowed it to stand upright or walk on
its hind legs like a bear.

nights in September, she was told the Zemlemer
was about. One night, she saw it, about 8 feet
tall with glowing eyes, walking swiftly outside
and confronted by barking dogs. When one at-
tacked, it picked the dog up and hurled it
through the air.

Animals Discovered since
900
Many new animal species have been officially de-
scribed since the turn of the twentieth century.
Some are big and unusual, while others are small
and unremarkable. A few were known previously
only from the fossil record. When the coelacanth
was discovered in 1938, it was recognized as a
member of a group that had been thought extinct
for at least 63 million years. However, the Co-
moro Islanders knew it well as the gombessa — a
fish with soft, oily flesh, an insipid taste, and a
laxative effect.
Other animals were well known to indigenous
peoples before their discovery by Western science.
In the 1850s, the Mbuti Pygmies of the Congo
first told U.S. explorer Henry Stanley about a
striped animal they called an okapi, which
sounded to Europeans like it might be some type
of “forest zebra” until a skull was obtained and it
turned out to be the only living relative of the gi-
raffe. The International Society of Cryptozoology
adopted the okapi as its official emblem in 1982.
The biggest cryptozoological discovery of the
nineteenth century was the Giant squid ( Archi -
teuthis ), known to eighteenth-century Norwegians
as the Kraken. This gigantic cephalopod has eight
arms growing out of its head and two much longer
tentacles with which it grabs its prey. It has the
largest eyes of any living animal, reaching up to 15
inches in diameter. It travels through the water at
high speed using a natural form of jet propulsion,
and it is strong enough to put up a struggle with
the sperm whales that feed on it. Few, if any, peo-
ple have seen this 5 5 -foot creature alive; as a deep-
sea animal, it comes to the surface only when it is
dead or dying.
To be fair, only a few new discoveries are made
because of cryptozoological investigations into an-
imals that are rumored to exist. Most come about
through routine specimen collection or purely by
accident. The list given here, consisting of 43 1 an-
imal species or other groups, is by no means com-
plete. Rather, it is a very selective compilation, in-
corporating either animal discoveries that have
been mentioned in cryptozoological literature or
those that are of unusual interest. A few rediscov-
eries are also included.
There are somewhere between 1 0 and 111 mil-
lion distinct organisms on earth, although only
about 1.8 million have been named. On average,
about 3 new species of birds and 200 new fishes
are found each year. An estimated 40 percent of
freshwater fishes in South America remain unde-
scribed. A vast number of unknown insects, inver-
tebrates, and microbes await discovery. In 1980,
the U.S. entomologist Terry Erwin collected
1,200 beetle species on nineteen trees in Panama
and found that 80 percent of them were previously
unknown to science. The deep-sea floor alone may
contain as many as a million unknown species,
many of them surrounding the hydrothermal
vents that were discovered only in 1977.
Many sources were used in compiling this list,
among them John A. Burton and Bruce Pearson’s
The Collins Guide to the Rare Mammals of the
World (1978), Karl Shuker’s The Lost Ark (1993),
and Mark Carwardine’s Whales, Dolphins, and
Porpoises (1995). Scientific and popular names

Marsupials
Alexandra’s cuscus. Phalanger alexandrae. Tailed
marsupial with red shoulders, first described by
Tim Flannery in 1995. Found on Gebe Island,
east of Halmahera in the Molucca Islands, Indo-
nesia.
Anderson’s mouse opossum. Marmosa ander-
soni. Small opossum first described in 1972 and
known only from Cuzco, Peru.
Black-shouldered opossum. Caluromysiops ir-
rupta. Rare Peruvian opossum known from fewer
than thirty specimens and first described in 1950.
Bronze quoll. Dasyurus spartacus. Dasyure or
native cat of Wasur National Park, Irian Jaya, In-
donesia. First described in 1988 by Stephen Van
Dyck.
Ceram bandicoot. Rhynchomeles prattorum.
Foot-long, ratlike marsupial not seen since its dis-
covery in 1920 on Mount Manusela in Ceram, In-
donesia.
Cinnamon antechinus. Antechinus leo. Mouse-
like marsupial with soft, cinnamon-colored fur,
discovered in 1979 in the central Cape York
Peninsula, Queensland, Australia.
Desert rat kangaroo. Caloprymnus campestris.
Small, hopping marsupial with large hind feet and a
shoulder height of 14-15 inches. It was rediscov-
ered in 1931 in the Lake Eyre region of South Aus-

ANIMALS DISCOVERED SINCE 1900 629
Iriomote cat. Prionailurus iriomotensis. Wild fe-
line 2 feet in length, with a dark-brown coat
marked with dark spots that tend to merge into
bands. Confined to the island of Iriomote-Jima in
the Ryukyu Islands off Japan, the cat was discov-
ered by Yukio Togawa in 1965 and placed in a
new genus, Mayailurus. Some authorities consider
it a distinct subspecies of the Leopard cat {P. ben-
galensis ), while others believe it to be closer to an-
cestral felines than any other living cat. Fossil re-
mains discovered on a nearby island suggest the
Iriomote cat has existed as a separate form for 2
million years. Its claws are not entirely sheathed
and do not fully retract, while its toes are partially
webbed. Less than 100 survive.
Liberian mongoose. Liberiictis kuhni. Very few
specimens have been observed since this long-
snouted, small-toothed mongoose was discovered
in 1957 by Hans Himmelheber. The first dead
specimens were given to scientists by a Liberian
hunter in 1974, the first live one in 1989. This an-
imal occurs in Cote d’Ivoire, Liberia, and Guinea.
Owston’s palm civet. Chrotogale owstoni. Only
a few specimens have been found in Laos, Viet-
nam, and southern China since its discovery in
1911 by Alan Owston. The Cue Phuong National
Park in Vietnam manages a conservation program
for this species.
Peruvian mountain coati. Nasuella sp. nov.
Discovered in 1998 by Peter Hocking in Apuri-
mac Department, Peru. Its nearest relative, N. oli-
vacea, lives in Ecuador and has different col-
oration.
Sea mink. Mustela macrodon. Large species of
mink formerly found along the coast of Maine and
New Brunswick. Its pale, reddish pelt was said to
be twice the size of a common mink’s. It was offi-
cially recognized in 1903, based on remains found
in Indian middens more than a decade after it had
become extinct. The last one may have been a
specimen killed in Maine in 1880.
Sulawesi palm civet. Macrogalidia musschen-
broekii. Brown civet, over 3 feet long with a tail
nearly 2 feet long, rediscovered in Indonesia in
1978 by John MacKinnon after being considered
extinct since World War II.
Tainguen civet. Viverra tainguensis. A small
civet discovered in 1996 in the Tainguen Plateau
in central Vietnam and subsequently found in
other tropical forests from Tonkin to Annam.
Tsushima cat. Prionailurus bengalensis euptil-
ura. Subspecies of leopard cat found in 1988 on
Tsushima Island between Korea and Japan.
Slightly smaller and darker than the leopard cat
found on mainland Korea, with black spots on yel-
lowish fur.
Cetaceans
Andrews’ beaked whale. Mesoplodon bowdoini.
Known from some twenty strandings off Australia
and New Zealand, this whale has two massive
teeth that project from its mouth. The beak and
lower jaw are white, and the body is dark blue-
black. Length, 13-15 feet. First described by Roy
Chapman Andrews in 1908. Also known as the
deep-crested whale. One of the New Zealand spec-
imens was identified by DNA analysis in 1998 as
a Blainville’s beaked whale (M. densirostris) , not
previously known in those waters.
Bahamonde’s beaked whale. Mesoplodon ba-
hamondi. Known only from the discovery of a
skull collected at Playa Blanca, Robinson Crusoe
Island, in the Juan Fernandez Archipelago, west of
Chile, in June 1986. Named in 1996.
Baiji. Lipotes vexillifer. A little-known animal,
very shy and retiring. Pale gray in color, 5-8 feet
long, with a long, narrow beak. This Yangtze River
dolphin has been mentioned in Chinese literature
since at least 200 B.C. but was discovered by West-
ern science only in 1916 when a specimen was sent
to the U.S. National Museum. A captive male
named Qi-Qi provided much information about
the species in the 1980s. Only a few dozen indi-
viduals remained in 1998.
Clymene dolphin. Stenella clymene. First de-
scribed in 1846 as Delphinus metis from a single
skull of unknown provenance. For a long time, it
was considered a variation of the Spinner dolphin
( S . longirostris) , but in 1981, this 5- to 6-foot At-
lantic dolphin was given its own species name.
Fraser’s dolphin. Lagenodelphis hosei. A 6- to 8-
foot dolphin with a dark lateral stripe that was first
described in 1956 by Francis Charles Fraser from
a skeleton collected in Sarawak in 1895. Not seen
alive until 1971, when strandings and sightings in
the Pacific and Indian Oceans revealed it to be rel-
atively common.
Gingko-toothed beaked whale. Mesoplodon
ginkgodens. Blue-black (male) or medium-gray (fe-
male), this 15- to 17-foot whale was first seen off
Tokyo in 1957. Named for its distinctive teeth,
which look like gingko leaves.
630 ANIMALS DISCOVERED SINCE 1900
Hubbs’ beaked whale. Mesoplodon carlhubbsi.
Stranded in 1945 off La Jolla, California, and
misidentified by Carl Hubbs as an Andrews’
beaked whale (M. bowdoini ), this dark, 16- to 17-
foot whale with a white beak and cap was recog-
nized as a separate species in 1963 by J. C. Moore.
Lesser beaked whale. Mesoplodon peruvianus.
Dark-gray Pacific whale, 11-12 feet long. Identi-
fied in 1976 from bones found at a fish market in
San Andres, Peru, by James G. Mead and officially
described in 1991.
Longman’s beaked whale. Indopacetus pacifi-
cus. Known only from two skulls (one found on a
Queensland beach in 1882, the other in 1955 in a
fertilizer factory in Mogadishu, Somalia), this
whale was first described in 1926 by Heber A.
Longman, who classed it as a Mesoplodon. Beaked-
whale expert Joseph Curtis Moore created a sepa-
rate genus for it in 1968, based on its shallow
tooth sockets and long beak. No one has ever seen
a living specimen, though Robert L. Pitman thinks
it might account for unidentified beaked whales
seen in the eastern Pacific.
Perrin’s beaked whale. Mesoplodon perrini.
Beaked whale described in 2001 from four incom-
plete specimens stranded on the east coast of the
United States.
Pygmy killer whale. Feresa attenuata. Rarely
seen in the wild though widely distributed, this lit-
tle-known, 7- to 8-foot blackfish was recorded in
1827 and 1875 but not seen again until its redis-
covery in 1952, when a specimen was caught near
Taiji, Japan.
Shepherd’s beaked whale. Tasmacetus shep-
herdi. Distinguished from other beaked whales by
the many small teeth lining both jaws and the two
large teeth at the tip of the mouth, this primitive,
dark-brown and creamy-white whale was first ex-
amined in 1933 by G. Shepherd when one washed
ashore at Owahe Beach, New Zealand. Length,
1 9-23 feet. A formal description was published in
1937 by Walter R. B. Oliver. Only two possible
sightings of a living animal have been recorded,
one from New Zealand and another from the Sey-
chelles Islands.
Spectacled porpoise. Phocoena dioptrica.
Known from about ten specimens from the south-
ern Atlantic coast of South America, this black-
and-white, 4- to 7-foot animal was first described
in 1912 by Fernando Lahille. Several have also
been seen around New Zealand.
True’s beaked whale. Mesoplodon mirus. Dark
gray or bluish-gray, 16-17 feet long. First de-
scribed by Frederick True in 1913 from a speci-
men stranded in North Carolina.
Vaquita. Phocoena sinus. One of the smallest
cetaceans (4-5 feet long), this porpoise is found
only in the extreme northern part of the Gulf of
California. First discovered in 1950 and described
in 1958 by Kenneth Norris and William McFar-
land. Also known as Cochito or the Gulf of Cali-
fornia harbor porpoise. A 1997 survey gave an es-
timate of only 5 67 individuals remaining in the
gulf.
Hoofed Mammals
Bornean yellow muntjac. Muntiacus ath erodes.
Deer with a yellowish-orange coat and a dark-
brown stripe along the spine. Described in 1982
by Colin Groves and Peter Grubb from specimens
on the island of Borneo, Indonesia.
Chacoan peccary. Catagonus wagneri. Large (3-
feet-high), brownish-gray wild pig first described
from Pleistocene fossil remains in 1930. Although
this animal was well known to the local Indians
and its pelt was used by New York furriers for
trimming hats and coats, it was not seen alive by
scientists until 1974 when it was discovered by
Ralph M. Wetzel. Found in the Gran Chaco of
Paraguay, Bolivia, and Argentina. Ralph M. Wet-
zel, The Chacoan Peccary , Catagonus wagneri (Rus-
coni) (Pittsburgh, Pa.: Carnegie Museum of Nat-
ural History, 1977).
Dawson’s caribou. Rangifer tarandus dawsoni.
Small, grayish, swamp -dwelling subspecies of cari-
bou found only on Graham Island, Queen Char-
lotte Islands, British Columbia, Canada. Its exis-
tence was confirmed in 1908, but it was deemed
extinct by 1935.
Dusky musk deer. Moschus fuscus. First de-
scribed in 1981 from a specimen in western Yun-
nan Province, China. Also found in Assam and
Sikkim States, India, and in Myanmar. Distin-
guished by its very dark color.
Dwarf bharal. Pseudois schaeferi. The upper
parts of this sheep are brownish gray with a tinge
of slaty blue. Discovered in 1934 in the Upper
Yangtze gorge, China, by E. Schaefer, it was con-
sidered a subspecies of the bharal in 1965, then
recognized as a separate species in 1978.
Giant forest hog. Hylochoerus meinertzhageni.
The world’s largest pig, first brought back from
ANIMALS DISCOVERED SINCE 1900 631
The Giant muntjac (Megamuntiacus vuquangensis) discovered in Laos and Vietnam in 1994. ( William M. Rehsamen)
East Africa by Lt. Richard Meinertzhagen in 1 904,
though Liberian natives had told Europeans about
the animal as long ago as the 1660s. Oddly
enough, the animal was more common prior to its
discovery, having been decimated by rinderpest in
1891. The giant forest hog reaches 7 feet in length
and is more than 3 feet at the shoulder. Its current
range is restricted to isolated localities from Liberia
to Kenya.
Giant muntjac. Megamuntiacus vuquangensis.
Described in 1996 by George Schaller and Eliza-
beth Vrba. Rob Timmins and Tom Evans had
found muntjac horns in private homes in the
Nakai Nam Theun Reserve in Laos, then came
across a live specimen in Lak Xao in 1994. John
MacKinnon also collected a skull in Vu Quang,
Vietnam. The animal has since been found to be
widespread in the Annam Highlands and has been
recorded in Mondol Kiri Province, Cambodia.
Javan rhinoceros. Rhinoceros sondaicus. One-
horned rhino with loose folds of skin that con-
tinue across its back. The horn is usually shorter
than 10 inches. Until the mid-nineteenth century,
the Javan rhinoceros was abundant from Bengal
through Southeast Asia to Sumatra and Java. It
was presumed extinct on the mainland after I960,
though sightings and tracks persisted in the Song
Be, Lam Dong, and Dong Nai Provinces in Viet-
nam, as well as along the Thai-Myanmar border.
Tracks were found in 1989 by George Schaller in
the Dong Nai River area in Vietnam (now en-
compassed by the Nam Bai Cat Thien National
Park), and photos of a live animal were obtained in
July 1999 by Mike Baltzer. A track was also found
in 1988 in Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctu-
ary in Thailand.
Kouprey. Bos sauveli. One of Asia’s largest
mammals and one of the world’s rarest mammals,
this large, gray forest ox (6 feet 3 inches at the
shoulder) remained undescribed until 1937 when
a young bull arrived at the Vincennes Zoo, whose
director, Achille Urbain, identified it as a new
species. The female’s horns are lyre-shaped, while
the male’s are spread wide and frayed at the tips.
Males have a dewlap that may almost reach the
ground with age. The tail is long (3 feet— 3 feet 6
632 ANIMALS DISCOVERED SINCE 1900
inches), with a bushy tip. The animal was given
its own genus ( Novibos ) in 1940, though it has
been accepted as a true ox {Bos) since 1951. Some
zoologists believe it to be either a hybrid of the
Gaur {Bos gaurus), the Banteng {Bos javanicus ),
and the domestic Zebu, or the z/r-species that
produced the Zebu. Known to the Cambodian
Khmer culture 800 years ago, it may also be a
feral survival of a Khmer domestic breed. By
1986, the kouprey was thought to still occur in
the southernmost provinces of Laos, in the Chuor
Phnum Dangrek Mountains of eastern Thailand,
and along the western edge of Vietnam, with its
distribution centered on the northern plains of
Cambodia.
Leaf muntjac. Muntiacus putaoensis. The small-
est true deer in the world, the leaf muntjac only
weighs about 25 pounds. It was discovered in
northern Myanmar in 1997 by Alan Rabinowitz
and is currently found in mountainous regions
northeast of Putao and south of the Nam Tamai
branch of the Mai Hka River in Myanmar.
Lesser brocket. Mazama bororo. A small deer
discovered near Capao Bonito, Sao Paulo State,
Brazil, in 1994.
Linh duong. Pseudonovibos spiralis. A bovid
with 18-inch, spiraling horns, which attracted at-
tention when they were collected in 1993 in a
market stall in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, by
Wolfgang Peter. The Vietnamese name translates
as “holy goat.” A living specimen has yet to be col-
lected, though local hunters describe it as a buf-
falo-like animal. In 2000, zoologist Arnoult Se-
veau and others ran DNA tests on four pairs of
horns collected in 1925 and concluded that these
specimens were horns of Domestic cattle {Bos tau-
rus) twisted into a distinctive lyre shape with pliers
and thus do not represent a new species. However,
the controversy is far from settled; a 2000 Russian
mitochondrial DNA analysis indicates the Linh
duong is a valid buffalo {Bovina) species, and
Robert H. Timm contends that two sets of trophy
horns owned by the University of Kansas and ob-
tained in Vietnam in 1929 belong to a genuine
spiral-horned Pseudonovibos.
Mountain anoa. Bubalus quarlesi. Miniature
water buffalo, weighing 350—650 pounds, with
two short, straight horns; discovered in 1910 by P.
A. Ouwens. Found only on Sulawesi, Indonesia.
Mountain nyala. Tragelaphus buxtoni. Little-
known Ethiopian antelope first collected in 1908
by Ivor Buxton and not described until 1910 by
Richard Lydekker. Dark grayish-brown, with faint
white markings. The horns, only found on the
males, grow 3-4 feet long. Stands 4 feet 6 inches
at the shoulder and weighs about 500 pounds.
Nangchen horse. A breed of horse discovered
in 1993 in northern Tibet by Michel Peissel. Ap-
parently bred in isolation for more than fourteen
centuries by nomadic horsemen at altitudes up to
15,700 feet, the horse has an enlarged heart and
lungs to cope with the heights. Michel Peissel, The
Last Barbarians: The Discovery of the Source of the
Mekong in Tibet (New York: Henry Holt, 1997).
Northern white rhinoceros. Ceratotherium
simum cottoni. One of the largest known land ani-
mals. Discovered by Alfred St. Hill Gibbons and
Maj. P. H. G. Powell-Cotton in 1900. At the time
of its discovery, this subspecies ranged from north-
west Uganda to Chad, the Democratic Republic of
the Congo, the Republic of the Congo, and
Sudan. Now critically endangered, it exists only in
the Garamba National Park in the Democratic Re-
public of the Congo, where there were thirty indi-
viduals in 2000.
Okapi. Okapia johnstoni. The poster animal for
cryptozoology, this odd, reclusive, hoofed mam-
mal was discovered in 1901 by Sir Harry John-
ston, governor of Uganda, after a year of investi-
gating stories and tracks of a mysterious forest
animal known to the Mbuti Pygmies of the De-
mocratic Republic of the Congo as o(k)api (mis-
represented as “atti” by Henry Morton Stanley ten
Okapi (Okapia johnstoni), discovered in 1901. (©
2002 ArtToday.com, Inc., an IMSI Company)
ANIMALS DISCOVERED SINCE 1900 633
years earlier) . At first thought to be a zebra because
of its distinctive stripes, the okapi was identified as
a short-necked cousin of the giraffe after Johnston
obtained some skulls. The first live specimen taken
out of Africa was delivered to the Antwerp Zoo in
1919. The animal stands just under 5 feet 6 inches
at the shoulder and has bold, black-and-white
markings on its rump and hind legs. An excep-
tionally long, blue-black tongue allows it to pluck
and tear leaves and twigs. Now confined to the
dense Ituri Forest in the northeast Congo, the
okapi has enjoyed absolute protection since 1933.
The Okapi Wildlife Reserve (http://www.
unesco.org/whc/sites/718.htm) was created in
1992. One of the rock paintings in the Tassili
N’Ajjer Plateau in Algeria may represent an okapi;
difficult to date, the Tassili frescoes were produced
sometime between 6000 and 1000 B.C. An excel-
lent description and history is found in Susan Lyn-
daker Lindsey, Mary Neel Green, and Cynthia L.
Bennett, The Okapi: Mysterious Animal of Congo-
Zaire (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1999).
Pygmy hippopotamus. Hexaprotodon liberien-
sis. Not as amphibious as Hippopotamus am-
phibius, this hippo stands only 2 feet 6 inches high
at the shoulder. The head is smaller, and the eyes,
ears, and nostrils do not protrude as much as those
of the common hippopotamus. The feet leave a
distinctive, four-toed track. Controversy raged in
the nineteenth century over whether skulls of this
animal represented a new species or whether they
were merely juvenile or freak specimens of the
common hippo, even though a living animal was
displayed at the Dublin Zoo for a few weeks in
1870. Hans Schomburgk captured five others in
Liberia in 1913, leading to the pygmy hippo’s ac-
ceptance as a distinct genus. The animals are re-
stricted to two areas: in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and
Cote d’Ivoire and between the Cross River and
Niger River deltas in Nigeria. Humans may have
hunted this species to extinction on Cyprus by
8000 B.C. A. H. Simmons, “Extinct Pygmy Hip-
popotamus and Early Man in Cyprus,” Nature
333 (1988): 334-337.
Pygmy hog. Sus salvanius. The smallest pig
(with a total length of 2 feet and a shoulder height
of less than 1 foot), thought to have become ex-
tinct by the 1960s. Rediscovered near Mangaldai,
Assam State, India, in 1971 by Dick Graves.
Queen of Sheba’s gazelle. Gazella bilkis. De-
scribed in 1985 by Colin Groves and Douglas Lay
from unusual skulls found in Yemen. Only known
from the high- altitude plains and hills around the
city of Ta’izz, Yemen. The animal is probably ex-
tinct in the wild, but four of these beautiful
gazelles, collected in 1996, are held in a private
collection in Qatar.
Red goral. Naemorhedus baileyi. A bright red
goat- antelope found in the Yunnan Province of
China, Tibet, Assam, and Myanmar that was first
described by Reginald Pocock in 1914. In 1961,
R. W. Hayman thought some specimens were dis-
tinct and named them N. cranbrooki, but these
have been considered conspecific since 1980.
Riwoche horse. A previously unsuspected
breed of wild horse was discovered in a remote val-
ley in northeastern Tibet in October 1995 by eth-
nologist Michel Peissel. Just under 4 feet high at
the shoulder, the horse has apparently been iso-
lated from other breeds for many centuries. It has
a black stripe down its back, stripes on its back
legs, and a black mane. Michel Peissel, The Last
Barbarians: The Discovery of the Source of the
Mekong in Tibet (New York: Henry Holt, 1997).
Roosevelt’s muntjac. Muntiacus rooseveltorum.
Found in 1929 near Muang Lo, Laos, this species
was thought extinct until rediscovered in Lak Xao,
Laos, by George Schaller in 1995. It has a tuft of
orange hair between its antlers and a black chin.
Specimens were found in Thanh Hoa Province,
Vietnam, in 1998.
Saola. Pseudoryx nghetinhensis. Discovered in
May 1992 by John MacKinnon in the Vu Quang
Nature Reserve, Vietnam, this antelope-like ox has
long, recurved, spindle-shaped horns; a cinnamon
coat; large facial glands; and distinctive black-and-
white markings on its face. Standing 3 feet tall at
the shoulder, the adult male is 4 feet 6 inches long
and weighs about 175 pounds, making it the
largest Asian mammal discovered since the
kouprey in 1937. The animal appears to be the
sole survivor of a family called the hemibovids, an-
cestral to both oxen and antelope, that was
thought to have died out 4 million years ago. The
first living specimen was caught in June 1994. Its
popular name, sao la, means “spindle horn.” Also
known as the Vu Quang ox, it is found in Laos as
well. Vu Van Dung, John MacKinnon, et al., “A
New Species of Living Bovid from Vietnam,” Na-
ture 365 (1993): 443-445.
Sumatran rhinoceros. Dicerorhinus sumatren-
sis. The smallest rhinoceros, the Sumatran can be
634 ANIMALS DISCOVERED SINCE 1900
The Saola, or Vu Quang ox (Pseudoryx nghetinhensis),
discovered in May 1992. (William M. Rebsamen/Fortean
Picture Library)
recognized by the two deep skin folds encircling its
body between the legs and the trunk and by its
thick coat of short, stiff hairs. The snout has two
horns. Reaches a shoulder height of 4 feet-4 feet 6
inches. Its historical range included the foothills of
the Himalayas in Bhutan; the Khasi Hills of India;
portions of Myanmar, Thailand, and peninsular
Malaysia; Sumatra; and Borneo. As of 2000, there
were only about 300 individuals in southern
Malaysia, Sumatra, and Sabah State in Borneo. Its
occurrence in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia has
not been confirmed.
Truong Son muntjac. Muntiacus truongsonen-
sis. A small, black deer with tiny antlers, first
recorded in the Truong Son Mountain range in
central Vietnam in April 1997 and described in
1998 by John MacKinnon.
Vietnamese warty pig. Sus bucculentis. Named
from a skull discovered in 1892 in Vietnam by
Pierre-Marie Hende, though no living specimen has
yet been found. A partial skull and tissue sample
turned up in Laos in 1993, matching local descrip-
tions of a pig with yellowish fur and a long snout.
Wild Bactrian camel. Camelus sp. nov. DNA
tests conducted on the remains of wild camels
from Lop Nur, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Re-
gion, China, indicate that these animals may be
sufficiently different from other camels to consti-
tute a separate species. These camels also have the
unusual ability to drink desert saltwater without ill
effect. “Salt Water-Drinking Camel May Be Sep-
arate Species,” Reuters, February 7, 2001.
Wood bison. Bison bison athabascae. A bison
with a larger body frame, longer appendages and
horns, wider hooves, and a denser and darker coat
than the plains Bison ( Bison bison bison). How-
ever, the two subspecies have been known to in-
terbreed and produce viable young. Thought ex-
tinct in the wild by 1940, a population of 200 of
this hardy subspecies was rediscovered in 1957 in
Wood Buffalo National Park, Alberta, Canada.
Since 1970, recovery efforts have reestablished six
disease-free, free-ranging wild herds in Canada
(2,400 bison) — the Chitek Lake, Hay-Zama,
Mackenzie, Nahanni, Nordquist, and Yukon
herds.
Rodents
Bangs’s mountain squirrel. Synth eosciurus
brochus. Fur is grizzled-brown above, grayish-
orange below. First collected in the Cordillera de
Talamanca, Panama, in 1902; later found in Costa
Rica in 1984.
Bavarian pine vole. Microtus bavaricus. Rare
Alpine vole first described in 1962 from
Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, and most re-
cently found in Austria in 2001.
Bristle-spined porcupine. Chaetomys sub-
spinosus. Brown, short-legged Brazilian porcupine
with short spines on its head and shoulders and
long bristles on its back. First described in 1818
but rarely seen since then. Rediscovered in 1986
near Valencia, Bahia State, by Ilmar Bastos Santos.
Brush-tailed rat. Isothrix sinnamariensis. A new
species of tree rat discovered in French Guiana in
1997.
Cajas water mouse. Chibchanomys orcesi. First
described in 1997, this small, nocturnal, nearly
blind mouse is endemic to the Cajas Plateau,
Ecuador. It uses its sensitive whiskers to locate
fishes and other food.
Candango mouse. Juscelinomys candango. Dis-
covered in 1960 and described in 1965 on the
basis of nine animals found on the grounds of the
ANIMALS DISCOVERED SINCE 1900 635
Parque Zoobotanical in Brasilia, Brazil. Not seen
since 1990, despite intensive searches.
Central American water mice. Semiaquatic,
dark-brown mice that prefer clear, mountain
streams. Goldman’s water mouse ( Rheomys raptor)
is found in Costa Rica and Panama and was first
described in 1912. Thomas’s water mouse ( R.
thomasi ), found in Mexico, Guatemala, and El Sal-
vador, was described in 1928. The Mexican water
mouse ( R . mexicanus) was described in 1959.
Central rock rat. Zyzomys pedunculatus. Only
five specimens of this arid-zone Australian rat
were recorded between its discovery in 1896 and
1960. In 1996 and 2001, the animal was found
in the Macdonnell Ranges, Northern Territory,
Australia.
Chinese dormouse. Chaetocauda sichuanensis.
Dormouse with a thick-haired, club-shaped tail.
Known from only two female specimens found in
1979 in northern Sichuan Province, China. Some
consider it a Forest dormouse (Dryomyss p.), but it
occurs 1,200 miles farther east than any of this
genus.
Crump’s mouse. Diomys crumpi. Blackish-gray
mouse first discovered on Mount Parasnath in
Bihar State, India, in 1917.
Cuban hutias. Medium-sized rodents with
dense fur, short legs, and hairy tails that are en-
demic to Cuba. Cabrera’s hutia (. Mesocapromys
angelcabrerai) is known only from specimens col-
lected in mangrove forests of the Cayos de Ana
Maria; it was described in 1979 and is unusual
among hutias in being sexually dimorphic. The
Dwarf hutia (M. nanus) is the smallest hutia, dis-
covered in the Cienaga de Zapata in 1917; it’s
not been seen since 1937, but its tracks and feces
have been found recently. The Large-eared hutia
(M. auritus) was first described in 1970 and is
known only from Cayo Fragoso. The San Felipe
hutia (M. sanfelipensis) is known only from four
specimens collected in 1970 from Cayo Juan
Garcia. A single specimen of Garrido’s hutia
( Mysateles garridoi ) was discovered in 1967 on
Cayos Maja; two animals turned up on nearby
keys in 1989.
Desert dormouse. Selevinia betpakdalaensis.
Small, grayish dormouse with a round, stocky
body and a long tail. Discovered in 1938 by Vik-
tor A. Selevin in the Betpak-Dala Desert, southern
Kazakhstan.
Dinagat bushy-tailed cloud rat. Crateromys
australis. Rough-furred, gray rat, about 10 inches
long, with a gray-and- white, 11 -inch tail. Known
from only one specimen obtained in 1975 on Di-
nagat Island in the Philippines.
Dollman’s tree mouse. Prionomys batesi.
Brownish tree mouse with velvety fur, described in
1910. Recorded only from Cameroon and the
Central African Republic.
Fish-eating rats. Semiaquatic rats with thick,
dark fur and very limited ranges. The Montane
fish-eating rat ( Neusticomys monticolus) was found
in Pichincha Province, Ecuador, in 1921. The
Venezuelan fish-eating rat (N. venezuelae) was dis-
covered near the Rio Never!, Venezuela, in 1929.
The Peruvian fish-eating rat (N. peruviensis) was
found in 1974 in Balta, Peru. Oyapock’s fish-
eating rat (N. oyapocki) was discovered in 1978
near Trois Sauts, French Guiana.
Golden hamster. Mesocricetus auratus. Hamster
with a compact, rounded body; short legs; thick,
golden-brown fur; large ears; and large cheek
pouches. This common and popular pet was first
mentioned in the 1797 edition of The Natural
History of Aleppo by Alexander Russell, who
thought it was the same as a European hamster.
George Robert Waterhouse described it as a new
species in 1839 after he obtained a skin. Live spec-
imens were taken to England in 1879 but appar-
ently were not bred successfully. The species was
rediscovered and possibly saved from extinction
on April 12, 1930, when an adult female and
eleven young were found in I^alab, Syria, by zool-
ogist Israel Aharoni. Aharoni’s specimens and their
descendents quickly became popular as laboratory

three specimens from Hebrew University’s para-
sitology department in the 1930s. A few wild spec-
imens have been found in Syria since 1971.

after rats were introduced on the island, but a
specimen of this rare seabird was collected in
1906. Eighteen nesting pairs were discovered after
its breeding locality was identified in 1951 on
Nonsuch Island; since then, it has been protected.
By 1999, it had reached a population of fifty-six
nesting pairs. Also known in Bermuda as the
cahow, after its strange nocturnal call. Recorded
occasionally off North Carolina.
Campbell Island snipe. Coenocorypha auck-
landica sp. nov. In November 1997, Jeremy Car-

the only large member of the pheasant family in
Africa.
Cox’s sandpiper. Calidris paramelanotos. De-
scribed by Shane Parker in 1982 from two speci-
mens collected in South Australia during the

total of seven specimens collected in India until it
was rediscovered in November 1997 by Pamela
Rasmussen, who photographed two owlets near
Shahada, Maharashtra State, India.
Gunnison sage grouse. Centrocercus minimus.
Genetic studies in 2000 determined that a group
of sage grouse in southwestern Colorado actually

ulous Greater sage grouse (C. urophasianus).
Imperial pheasant. Lophura imperialis. De-
scribed in 1924 by Jean Delacour and Pierre
Jabouille from a pair found a year earlier in the

successfully in Europe. A third specimen was taken
in 1990 at the Ke Go Nature Reserve in Ha Tinh
Province, and a fourth was obtained in 2000 at the
proposed Dakrong Nature Reserve in Quang Tri
Province. Plumage comparisons by Pamela Ras-
mussen in 1998 and more recent DNA research
strongly suggest that this pheasant is a naturally oc-
curring hybrid between the Silver pheasant (L. nyc-
themara) and the Edwards pheasant (L. edwardsi).

ANIMALS DISCOVERED SINCE 1900 639
Vladivostok, Siberia, but not accepted as a distinct
species until 1917 after a female was taken near
Pusan, South Korea. Now critically endangered
and possibly extinct. Recently reported in a variety
of inland wetlands in China. Elsewhere, the most
recent unconfirmed sightings were on an island
southwest of Vladivostok, in 1964; on the north-
east coast of North Korea, in March 1971; and in
eastern Russia, in March 1985.
Lear’s macaw. Anodorhynchus leari. Named in
1856 after nonsense poet and painter Edward
Lear, who painted a captive specimen of this

Sick, who had been searching for the bird for
twenty- four years, saw a flock of twenty in the
Raso da Catarina Ecological Reserve, Bahia State,
Brazil.

northeastern coast, and another dead specimen
was obtained in 1990. Since 1993, at least fifteen
have been seen on Masoala Peninsula.
Mascarene shearwater. Puffinus atrodorsalis. A
black-backed seabird of the western Indian Ocean
first described in 1995. However, more recent
DNA analysis indicates it may only be an imma-
ture Audubon’s shearwater (P. ilherminieri).
Mikado pheasant. Syrmaticus mikado. Pur-
plish-black pheasant with bright red face patch
and white bars on the rump and tail. Described in
1906 by W. R. Ogilvie-Grant from specimens ob-
tained in the central mountains of Taiwan.

lakes in Mongolia and central China; visits coastal
areas of China during early spring and late fall. At
first thought to be a subspecies or hybrid, this gull
was rediscovered in the Buryat Republic, Siberia,
in 1967. Classed as a distinct species since 1931.
Sangihe scops owl. Otus collari. Four speci-
mens of this owl were collected between 1866 and
1887 on the island of Sangihe, north of Sulawesi
in Indonesia. After it was rediscovered in May
1985 by Frank Rozendaal, it was recognized as a
distinct species and described by Pamela Ras-
mussen in 1998. It is still relatively common in the
forested parts of the island.
Scarlet-banded barbet. Capito wallacei. The
only member of its genus restricted to montane
cloud forest, this colorful bird was first collected in
the Andean cloud forest of eastern Peru in 1996
and described in 2000.

tened Notornis mantelli hochstetteri by anatomist
Richard Owen to distinguish it from the North Is-
640 ANIMALS DISCOVERED SINCE 1900
land remains. Other Takahes were found on South
Island in 1851, 1879, and 1898, but the bird was-
n’t officially rediscovered until November 20,
1948, when Geoffrey Orbell found breeding pairs
at a remote lake in New Zealand that would be
named Takahe Lake. An estimated 250 birds were
later found in the Murchison Mountains. In 1973,
the South Island Takahe was reclassed as a relation
of the Purple swamphen ( Porphyrio melanotus) and
renamed P. hochstetteri. A total of 221 birds were
counted in the 1999-2000 season.

1990, when six were taken to the Hanoi Zoo.
Now considered a subspecies of the Edwards
pheasant (L. edwardsi).
Wake Island rail. Rallus wakensis. Nearly
flightless, ground-nesting rail with brown back
and barred abdomen. Described in 1903 by Lord
Walter Rothschild from specimens obtained by a
Japanese vessel on Wake Island in 1892. Last
observed in 1940. Probably eaten out of exist-
ence by Japanese occupation forces during World
War II.
White-winged guan. Penelope albipennis. A
pheasantlike bird described in 1878 from a speci-
men found on the coast of northern Peru. More
than 3 feet long and weighing 4.5 pounds. Redis-
covered and photographed in the Andean foothills

Golden-fronted bowerbird. Amblyornis flav-
ifrons. Described in 1895 from specimens on sale
in European feather markets, this bird wasn’t seen
in its native Foja Mountains in Irian Jaya, In-
donesia, until 1981, when it was spotted by Jared

Gurney’s pitta. Pitta gurneyi. The male has a
bright blue cap, jet-black face, yellow throat, and
striped chest. Living in the underbrush of thick,
lowland rain forest, its presence can often only be
confirmed by its distinctive voice characteristics.
Gurney’s pitta has been ranked among the
world’s twelve most endangered species. It is 8
inches long, endemic to a small area extending
from southern Myanmar to peninsular Thailand
and south to the Malaysian border. It was de-
clared extinct in 1985 due to a lack of reports
after 1952, but it was photographed just one year
later in Thailand. The only possibly viable popu-
lation is at Khao Nor Chuchi in Krabi Province,
Thailand, in the region’s last remaining lowland
rain forest, which contained only ten of these

east of Albany, Western Australia, after last being
reported in 1889.
Pardusco. Nephelornis oneilli. Tanager-like bird
discovered in 1973 in the Carpiza Mountains,
Peru. Unlike similar species, the Pardusco has two
unusual muscles that make it difficult to classify.
Pink-legged graveteiro. Acrobatornis fonsecai.
Small, black- and-gray ovenbird observed for the
first time in November 1994 by Paulo Sergio Fon-
seca in southeastern Bahia State, Brazil. It inhabits
shade trees overhanging cocoa plantations.

the male and reddish-brown back in the female. It
was first described in 1998 from a specimen lo-
cated by Robert Payne on the Jos Plateau in north-
ern Nigeria.
Rufous-headed robin. Luscinia ruficeps. Dis-
covered in the Qin Ling Mountains of Shaanxi
Province, China, in 1905 but not seen again until
1963, when a specimen turned up on Mount
Berincang in the Cameron Highlands of Malaysia.
Recorded recently at Jiuzhaiguo, northern Sichuan
Province, China.
Sangha forest robin. Stiphornis sanghensis. Dark-
gray back with a bright yellow-red throat and a yel-
low belly. Recognized as a distinct species by
Pamela Beresford and Joel Cracraft in 1996 after
they examined more than 1 00 forest robins in mu-
seum collections and conducted a confirmatory
DNA analysis. Found in the Dzanga-Sangha Dense
Forest Reserve in the Central African Republic.
Sao Tome grosbeak. Neospiza concolor. Large-
headed finch endemic to the island of Sao Tome
in the Gulf of Guinea, first described in 1888. Not

as a new species in 1992 from skins found at the
Zoological Museum at Amsterdam.
Stresemann’s bush crow. Zav attar iornis strese-
manni. Discovered in 1938 in a limited area
around Yabelo, Ethiopia. Classed with the crows
but looks somewhat like a starling and has a star-
linglike nest. Has a hooked bill and bristles over
the nostrils.
Taiwan bush-warbler. Brady pterus alishanensis.
First collected in the Ali-Shan Mountains of Tai-
wan in 1917 as a subspecies of the Russet bush-
warbler ( B . mandelli). Recognized as a separate
species in 2000, when its song was discovered to
be distinct from that of other populations.
Reptiles and Amphibians
Archey’s frog. Leiopelma archeyi. Tiny frog so well
adapted to a terrestrial existence that it lacks web-
bing between its toes. Described in 1942, though
reported since the nineteenth century. Endemic to
the Coromandel Peninsula, New Zealand.
Arnold’s giant tortoise. Dipsochelys arnoldi.
Described in 1982 by Roger Bour from three
misidentified museum specimens. This tortoise
was presumed extinct in its native Seychelles Is-
lands by 1840, but captive animals with shapes
different from the Aldabran species (Z). dussum-
ieri) turned up in 1997 and apparently represent
survivals of the original giant saddle-backed tor-
toises. A total of eighteen are now known.
Black toad. Bufo exsul. Small, dark toad with
white spots and tracings, discovered by Carl L.
Hubbs in 1934 but not described until 1942. Oc-
curs only in water flowing from springs in the
Deep Springs Valley in Inyo County, California.
Considered by some to be a subspecies of the
Western toad ( B . boreas).
Bolson tortoise. Gopherus flavomarginatus.
Documented in 1888 but recognized as a distinct
species only in 1939, this is the largest land reptile
in North America. Its carapace may reach 18
inches in length. Its range is restricted to the Bol-
son de Mapimi Desert, Coahuila State, Mexico,
though it is known from fossil finds as far north as
Oklahoma.
Catahoula salamander. Plethodon ainsworthi.
Two specimens were discovered in 1964 near Bay
Springs, Mississippi, and misidentified as a similar
Plethodon species. James Lazell described them as
belonging to a distinct species in 1998, but no fur-
ther individuals have been collected.
Cerrophidion petlalcalensis, A small pit viper
found in the Cerro Petlalcala south of Orizaba,
Veracruz State, Mexico, and first described in
1999. One of its discoverers, Marco Antonio
Lopez- Luna, was bitten in the hand by this viper.
Cochin Forest cane turtle. Heosemys silvatica.
Known only from one or two specimens obtained
in 1911 from the Cochin State Forests, Kerala
State, India, until it was rediscovered in the Cha-
lakudi Valley in 1982.
Colombian giant toad. Bufo blombergi. One of
the world’s largest toads, 8-9 inches long, this
species was first described in 1951 from a specimen
taken in Narino Department, Colombia. Found
from northern Ecuador to western Colombia.
Crocodile lizard. Shinisaurus crocodilurus.
Dark gray-and-red lizard, 8-12 inches long, found
in the Dayao Shan Mountain range, Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Province, China. Discov-
ered in 1928, though long known to the Chinese
as the “lizard of great sleepiness.”
Delcourt’s giant gecko. Hoplodactylus del-
courti. The only known specimen of this short-
headed, bulky gecko, measuring 2 feet long, was
obtained sometime in the nineteenth century by
the Marseille Natural History Museum. The her-
petology curator, Alain Delcourt, inspected the
specimen more closely in 1979, which led to its
recognition as a new species in 1986 and its de-
scription by Aaron Bauer and Anthony P. Russell.
Its provenance is unknown, though since other
Hoplodactylus geckos live primarily in New
Zealand, it’s likely to have come from there. Maori
legends of the Kawekaweau may refer to encoun-
ters with this gecko.
Earless monitor. Lanthanotus borneensis. A
nocturnal lizard of Sarawak State on the island of
Borneo in Indonesia that grows to 1 8 inches, lacks
external ear openings, and has transparent lower
eyelids and a relatively long tail. Said to be the
world’s rarest lizard, it may have evolved from a
lizard group ancestral to the snakes. First described
in 1878, it was placed in a family of its own (Lan-
thanotidae) in 1954. In 1961, a live specimen was
finally captured and examined.
Eleutherodactylus iberia. North America’s
smallest frog. Black with orange stripes and only
0.4 inches long, it was discovered in 1996 on
Monte Iberia, Cuba, by Alberto Estrada.
ANIMALS DISCOVERED SINCE 1900 643
Fijian crested iguana. Brachylophus vitiensis.
The first reptile species to be bred in captivity be-
fore receiving a scientific name. Discovered on the
island of Yadua Taba in Fiji in 1979 by John Gib-
bons, this iguana has a pale green body with white
stripes and a crest of spines along its back. In
1980, the island was designated as the first Fijian
wildlife reserve in order to preserve the iguana.
Fitzroy River tortoise. Rheodytes leukops. Dis-
covered in 1973, this turtle is able to remain under
water for long periods because it can respirate
through a network of blood vessels in its cloaca. It
can stay submerged for as long as three days to
avoid predatory crocodiles. Found only in the
Fitzroy River, Queensland, Australia.
Gastric brooding frog. Rheobatrachus silus.
The first completely aquatic frog discovered in
Australia, it was also the first species known to in-
cubate its eggs in the female’s stomach. A speci-
men was obtained by the Queensland Museum in
1913, but it was not recognized as distinct. Con-
sidered locally abundant when it was rediscovered
in the Blackall and Conondale Ranges of south-
eastern Queensland in 1973, it vanished within a
few years and may now be extinct. The last wild
frog was seen in 1980, and the last captive speci-
men died in 1983. However, another species ( R .
vitellinus) was discovered farther north near Eun-
gella in 1983, though no wild specimens have
been found since 1985.
Georgia blind salamander. Haideotriton walla-
cei. A 3-inch-long, blind, pinkish-white, semitrans-
parent aquatic cave and well dweller discovered in
an artesian well in Albany, Georgia, in 1939.
Golden lancehead. Bothrops insular is. Ex-
tremely venomous pit viper first described in 1921
and found only on the Ilha de Queimada Grande
off the coast of Itanhaem, Sao Paulo State, Brazil.
Its numbers declined drastically in the late 1 960s,
but it is once again abundant today.
Golden poison frog. Phyllobates terribilis. The
most toxic frog known to date, its batrachotoxin
secretions are used by the Embre and Choco Indi-
ans of western Colombia for poison darts. One
adult frog has enough poison in its skin to kill 100
humans. Its color is a solid metallic gold. De-
scribed in 1978.
Goliath frog. Conraua goliath. The world’s
longest frog, 10-14 inches long, was described in
1906 by George Boulenger after its discovery at
Evouma, Cameroon.
Gulf snapping turtle. Elseya lavarackorum.
Discovered in Lawn Hill Creek, Queensland, Aus-
tralia, in 1995, this large, black turtle had been
thought extinct for 50,000 years. It subsists on
wild figs and has developed a taste for bananas
since its discovery.
Hierro giant lizard. Gallotia simonyi. This
dark-colored, 2-foot lizard was rediscovered in
1975 in an area called Fuga de Gorreta on El Hi-
erro in the Canary Islands, after being thought ex-
tinct since 1935. The island government has car-
ried out a preservation plan since 1997 to ensure
its survival. On the neighboring island of La
Gomera, six living specimens of a similar, 1 8-inch-
long reptile were discovered in March 2000 on the
cliffs of Valle Gran Rey. It has been classed as G.
gomerana y although the taxonomy of these lizards
is still unsettled.
Hussain’s night frog. Nyctibatrachus hussaini.
A large species of black night frog with yellow
spots was discovered in the Kudremukh National
Park, Karnataka State, India, in 2000. It was
named after Indian ecologist S. A. Hussain.
Israel painted frog. Discoglossus nigriventer.
Discovered in 1940 in the Hula Basin, Israel, and
now considered extinct due to swamp drainage
and agricultural development. Colored ocher, rust,
gray, and black on its back. Only five specimens
are known, the last obtained in 1955.
Jaragua sphaero gecko. Sphaerodactylus ari-
asae. A contender for the world’s smallest reptile,
this tiny (0.63 -inch) gecko was discovered on Isla
Beata, Dominican Republic, in 2001 by S. Blair
Hedges and Richard Thomas. Its size is compara-
ble to S. parthenopion , found only on Virgin
Gorda in the British Virgin Islands; discovered in
1965 by Thomas, the largest mature female mea-
sured 0.71 inch from snout to vent.
Jimi River frog. Rana jimiensis. Discovered in
1960 and found in the upper reaches of the Jimi,
Ramu, and Sepik Rivers, this frog is the second
largest in Papua New Guinea, just under 6.5
inches long.
Komodo dragon. Varanus komodoensis. The
world’s largest living lizard was first described in
1912 by Peter A. Ouwens from a specimen killed
by J. K. H. van Steyn van Hensbroek on Komodo
Island in Indonesia. This lizard’s tail is less than
half of its total length, making it stockier than
other monitors of similar size. The largest verified
Komodo dragon reached a length of 10 feet 6

inches and was purported to weigh 366 pounds. In
1926, American hunter and wildlife collector W.
Douglas Burden organized an expedition to the is-
land, sponsored by the American Museum of Nat-
ural History; he was accompanied by big-game
hunter F. J. Defosse and Smith College herpetolo-
gist Emmett Reid Dunn. Burden took two live
Komodo dragons to the Bronx Zoo (the first in
captivity anywhere). Burden told the story of his
trip to movie producer Merian C. Cooper, who
changed the objective from a giant lizard to a giant
ape and added heroine Fay Wray to produce the
classic movie King Kong in 1933. Dick Lutz and J.
Marie Lutz, Komodo: The Living Dragon (Salem,
Oreg.: Dimi Press, 1997).
Lake Cronin snake. Echiopsis atriceps. Ven-
omous elapid snake discovered in 1979 near Lake

less, legless South American caecilian first de-
scribed in 1993 by Ronald Nussbaum and Mark
Wilkinson from a Viennese museum specimen.
Mallorcan midwife toad. Alytes muletensis. Eu-
rope’s rarest amphibian, this toad was first de-
scribed in fossilized form as a new genus
( Baleaphryne ) by Spanish researchers in 1977. In
1979, living tadpoles and young frogs were dis-
covered in the Sierra de Tramuntana on the island
of Mallorca, Balearic Islands, Spain. A small toad
with a relatively large head and rounded snout, it
is confined to a limited area of limestone gorges.
Mary River tortoise. Elusor macrurus. Flat-
tailed, freshwater Australian turtle first described
in 1994 from a specimen found near Gympie,
Queensland, though its hatchlings had been sold
in Melbourne pet shops since the 1960s. A fully
grown specimen was not seen in the wild until
1987.
New Guinea crocodile. Crocodylus no-
vaeguineae. Freshwater crocodile, 10-13 feet long
with a narrow snout, first described in 1929 by

mens. It apparently has not been collected any-
where in Mexico since 1972.
One-toed amphiuma. Amphiuma pholeter.
Rare, gray-to-brown dwarf salamander, 8-12
inches long, discovered in 1950 and found only in
southwestern Georgia and the panhandle and Gulf
Hammock region of Florida.
Panamanian golden frog. Atelopus zeteki.
Bright yellow frog with black blotches discovered
in El Valle de Anton, Code Province, Panama, by
James Zetek in 1929. Finally classed as a separate
species in 1993. Not only do these frogs signal vo-
cally, they also communicate by semaphores, a lit-
tle-known hand-waving phenomenon. Their skin
is highly toxic.
Phantom frog. Eleutherodactylus phasma. Rain
frog discovered in the Cordillera de Talamanca,
Costa Rica, in 1996.
Philippine crocodile. Crocodylus mindorensis.
Distinct freshwater species, 9-10 feet long with a
broad snout and heavy dorsal armor, first de-
scribed by Karl Schmidt in 1935.

by DNA analysis. Previously, the species was
known only in Africa, from Nigeria to Egypt.
Ramsey Canyon leopard frog. Rana subaquavo-
calis. Rare, 8-inch frog discovered in 1990 by James
E. Platz in southeastern Arizona. It is the only frog
known that vocalizes exclusively under water. Its
range is restricted to small ponds located in the
Huachuca Mountains near Sierra Vista, Arizona.
Tricolored monitor. Varanus yuwonoi. Dark,
slender, aggressive monitor lizard, 4-5 feet long, of
Halmahera, Indonesia, discovered by animal
dealer Frank Yuwono. First described in 1998.
ANIMALS DISCOVERED SINCE 1900 645

light-blue or turquoise tinge, described by Wolf-
gang Bohme and Thomas Ziegler in 1999.
Vietnamese sharp-nosed snake. Cryptophidion
annamense. Photographed west of Da Nang in
1968 during the Vietnam War, this small, bur-
rowing snake with a pointed nose was described in
1992 by Van Wallach and Gwilym S. Jones. How-
ever, in 1996, it was shown to be the well-known
Sunbeam snake ( Xenopeltis unicolor) by Olivier
Pauwels and Danny Mierte.
Yellow-headed temple turtle. Hieremys annan-
dalii. A freshwater species that can reach 2 feet
long, this turtle was first described in 1903, even
though it had been well known as a sacred turtle to
Thai priests.

Sharks and Fishes
Ammoglanis diaphanus. A pencil catfish from the
Rio Javaes, Tocantins State, Brazil, first described
in 1994 by Wilson Costa. Feeds on other fishes by
attaching itself to their gills and sucking their
blood.
Armored stickleback. Indostomus paradoxus.
Small fish discovered in Lake Indawgyi, Myanmar,
in 1926. Has the unusual ability to move its head
vertically.
Blind loach. Paracobitis smithi. A river loach
that lives in underground pools at high altitude in
the Zagros Mountains, Iran. Discovered in 1976.
Borneo river shark. Glyphis species B. Redis-
covered in 1997 in the Kinabatangan River, Sabah
State, Borneo, Malaysia. It was previously known
only from a single specimen taken in an unnamed
river in Borneo in the 1890s and preserved in a Vi-
ennese museum.
Camotillo. Normanichthys crockeri. A 4.5-inch
sculpin completely covered with scales. Discovered
off the coast of Chile in 1935.
Coelacanth. Latimeria chalumnae. The Coela-
canth is the only surviving member of a group of
lobefin fishes that dates back 400 million years to
the Early Devonian. No fossil coelacanths have
been found that are more recent than the Creta-
ceous period, 65 million years ago. Although the
coelacanth is classed as a bony fish, its backbone is
cartilaginous, and it has other features that are sim-
ilar to the sharks and rays. Found in the Indian
Ocean around the Comoro Islands and off Mozam-
bique, Madagascar, and South Africa, this remark-
able-looking fish was discovered near the mouth of
the Chalumna River off East London, South Africa,
on December 22, 1938, by the crew of the fishing
trawler Nerine. It was inspected by Marjorie
Courtenay-Latimer, curator of the local museum,
who contacted fossil fish expert J. L. B. Smith at
nearby Grahamstown. Smith immediately recog-
nized it as a fossil lobefin fish and formally de-
scribed it in 1939. Another specimen was caught on
December 20, 1952, when a Comoro Island fisher-
man named Ahamadi Abdallah netted it off An-
jouan Island. Hans Fricke, of the Max Planck In-
stitut, was the first to film coelacanths under water
in January 1987 using a submersible vessel. Other
groups of coelacanths were discovered off Toliara,
Madagascar, in 1995; in Sodwana Bay, South
Africa, in October 2000; and off Milindi, Kenya, in
2001. A second species, Latimeria menadoensis, was
obtained on July 30, 1998, by Mark and Arnaz
Erdmann in the Pacific Ocean off Manado, Su-
lawesi, Indonesia. It is the same as the Comoran
coelacanth, except that its color is brown with gold
flecks. J. L. B. Smith, Search beneath the Sea: The

Crossocheilus sp. nov. This catfish, discovered
in 1997 in the Vu Quang Nature Reserve in Viet-
nam, measures between 8 and 10 inches and
weighs over 3 pounds. It has a golden stripe on its
back and a silver stripe on its belly. It appears to be
abundant: within fifteen minutes, Nguyen Thai
Tu caught eighteen specimens. The local Viet-
namese people catch the fish for food.

Megamouth shark. Megachasma pelagios. The
sixth-largest species of living shark, 14-17 feet
long and weighing more than 1,600 pounds, first
collected 26 miles northeast of Oahu in the
Hawaiian Islands on November 15, 1976. A sec-
ond specimen was taken off Santa Catalina Island,
California, in November 1984, and a third washed
up on a beach near Mandurah, Western Australia,
in 1988. At least eleven others have turned up
since in Japan, southern Brazil, Senegal, South

the Philippines. The head and mouth of this shark
are unusually long and wide (hence its name), with
thick lips, 400 small teeth arranged in 236 rows,
and a luminescent mouth lining. The animal feeds
on plankton. The first megamouth was found to
harbor a completely new genus and species of
tapeworm (. Mixodigma leptaleum). Formally de-
scribed in 1983 by Leighton Taylor, Leonard J. V.
Compagno, and P. J. Struhsaker, who placed it in
a new family, Megachasmidae. Kazunari Yano,

Discovered in 1992 by Nguyen Thai Tu in the Vu
Quang Nature Reserve in Vietnam.
Widemouth blindcat. Satan eurystomus. An
unpigmented catfish discovered in an artesian well
near San Antonio, Texas, sometime before 1938.
Described by Carl L. Hubbs and R. M. Bailey in
1947.
Everything Else
Archaea. An entirely new domain of bacteria-like
organisms identified in 1 977 by Carl Woese. Many
of these microbes thrive under such extreme envi-
ronmental conditions as deep-sea hydrothermal
vents, hot springs, underground petroleum de-
posits, highly acidic or alkaline water, hypersaline
water, or the digestive tracts of animals, though re-
cently they have also been found with plankton in a
normal marine environment. Some of them metab-
olize sulfur, others are major producers of methane,
and still others aerobically reduce iron or various
648 ANIMALS DISCOVERED SINCE 1900
sulfates. The methanogens have been known for a
long time, but the other types are recent discoveries.
Woese determined that the RNA sequences of ar-
chaea are as different from bacteria as they are from
all other forms of life (eucarya), so he proposed that
all life is made up of these three basic domains.
Big-fin squid. Magnapinna pacifica. Known
only from one paralarva and two 2-inch-long ju-
veniles, this shallow-water, eastern Pacific squid
required a new family when it was described in
1998 by Michael Vecchione and Richard E.
Young. Its most distinctive feature is a massive ter-
minal fin that is as long or longer than its body. A
21 -foot-long “mystery squid” with long tentacles
that was photographed at depths of 6,000-15,000
feet by staffers of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Re-
search Institute in May 2001 may turn out to be
the adult form of this animal.
Black sea nettle. Chrysaora achlyos. This eastern
Pacific jellyfish can be quite massive, with a dark-
purple bell that measures up to 3 feet in diameter
and pink tentacles nearly 20 feet long. First de-
scribed by Joel W. Martin and others in 1997, it
constitutes the largest invertebrate discovery of the
twentieth century. Specimens had been pho-
tographed as long ago as the 1920s.
Blind cirrate octopus. Cirrothauma murrayi. A
deep-sea cephalopod that is completely blind. Dis-
covered in the North Atlantic in 1910.
Cooloola monster. Cooloola propator. A crick-
etlike insect discovered in Cooloola National Park,
Queensland, in 1976; its discovery required the
creation of a new family, the Cooloolidae.
Crinoids. Although there are more than 650
living species of crinoids, or sea lilies, they are bet-
ter known as common marine fossils. A few re-
cently discovered species are the sole representa-
tives of families long thought extinct. Guillecrinus
reunionensis, belonging to the Paleozoic Subclass
Inadunata, was brought up from 6,500 feet off
Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean by Michel
Roux in 1985; G. neocaledonicus was found off
New Caledonia in the Pacific a few years later. An-
other living fossil from the Cretaceous period,
Gymnocertus richeri of the Order Cyrtocrinida, was
discovered off the coast of New Guinea and de-
scribed in 1987; it was found to produce a group
of pigmented molecules, since called gym-
nochromes, that are useful in treating the viruses
that cause herpes and dengue fever.
Cycliophora. A phylum created in 1995 by
Peter Funch and Reinhardt Kristensen to accom-
modate Symbion pandora, a tiny, sessile animal at-
tached to a Norway lobster taken from the North
Sea. Smaller than a pinhead, this strange animal
reproduces asexually by budding off male and fe-
male larvae from its digestive tract.
Dracula ant. Adetomyrma venatrix. First de-
scribed in 1993 from specimens found in Mada-
gascar, these ants show some anatomical character-
istics that suggest a closer affinity to ancestral
wasps than other ants. In addition, they feed off
the blood (hemolymph) of their larvae. The first
colony was discovered in 2000.
Giant huntsman spider. Heteropoda maxima.
Rediscovered in 2001 by Peter Jaeger in a speci-
men collection of the Museum of Natural History
in Paris (where it had been stored for seventy
years), this large arachnid is found in Laos and has
a legspan of 9-12 inches.
Giant mantis prawn. Erugosquilla grahami. A
16-inch-long shrimp with excellent eyesight and
huge praying mantis-like pincers was discovered
in 1999 by Shane Ahyong just east of Sydney’s
harbor bridge, New South Wales, Australia. Said
to be very good to eat.
Giant Tambusisi tree-nymph. Idea tambu-
sisiana. Butterfly with a wingspan of 6.5 inches
discovered on the slopes of Mount Tambusisi, Su-
lawesi, Indonesia, in 1980.
Giant vent tubeworm. Riftia pachyptila. Giant
tubeworms with blood-red plumes that live next to
hydrothermal vents in the ocean floor. They were
discovered at the same time as the vents them-
selves, in 1977, when the submersible Alvin inves-
tigated thermal anomalies near the Galapagos Is-
lands. Tubeworm larvae attach themselves to the
lava near the vents, building long, white tubes as
they grow. The plumes absorb sulfurous water that
bacteria inside the worm use to generate energy
and food for the worms. The worms grow at phe-
nomenal rates, up to 34 inches per year, making
them the fastest-growing marine invertebrates
alive. The tubes extend to a maximum of 6-8 feet,
completely without benefit of sunlight.
Giant white clam. Calyptogena magnifica. First
seen in 1 977 near deep-sea hydrothermal vents in
the Galapagos Rift, this foot-long clam has a white
shell and blood-red flesh that contains large
amounts of hemoglobin.
Graptolite. Ceph alo discus graptolitoides. Discov-
ered at a depth of 830 feet off the island of Lifou
ANIMALS DISCOVERED SINCE 1900 649
in New Caledonia in 1989, this sessile, encrusting
colony was assigned to the Pterobranch Phylum of
deuteros tomes. However, its spinelike structures
bear a strong resemblance to fossil graptolite
colonies, which have been extinct since the Car-
boniferous period, 300 million years ago. P. N.
Dilly, “ Cephalo discus graptolitoides sp. nov.: A
Probable Extant Graptolite,” Journal of Zoology
229 (1993): 69-78.
Haemopis caeca. This leech was discovered in
1986 by Serban Sarbu in the unique ecosystem of
Movile Cave in Romania. At least fourteen other
new species have been identified there, including a
mollusc ( Heleobia dobrogica :), a pseudoscorpion
( Chthonius monicae ), a water scorpion ( Nepa
anophthalma) , two rove beetles (. Medon spp.), a
dwarf sheet spider ( Iberina caeca), a pillbug (Ar-
madillidium t abac arui), a mite ( Labidostoma mo-
tasi ), and a nematode ( Chronogaster troglodyte s).
Karl Shuker, “The Cave Time Forgot,” Fortean
Times, no. 88 (July 1996): 42.
Hutchinsoniella macracantha. Tiny, shrimp-
like crustacean discovered in soft sediments off the
shore of Long Island, New York, in 1933. Only
2-4 millimeters long, with nine pairs of equally
proportioned limbs, these creatures had to be
placed in a new class, Cephalocarida. The crus-
tacean’s head resembles a trilobite’s.
Hydrothermal vent shrimp. Rimicaris exocu-
lata. An abundant bresilioid shrimp that swarms
around underwater rocks near abyssal “black
smoker” vents. Discovered in 1985, this blind
shrimp has evolved a sophisticated sensor (the “dor-
sal organ”) for locating distant hydrothermal vents.
Hystrichopsylla schejferi. The world’s largest
flea, first described in 1921 from a specimen dis-
covered in Washington State in the nest of a Moun-
tain beaver ( Aplodontia rufa), its only known host.
Females may exceed 1 centimeter in length.
Indian stick insect. Carausius morosus. De-
scribed in 1908, this is one of the world’s most fa-
mous captivity-bred insects. It is native to the
Palmi Hills, Tamil Nadu State, India.
Iowa Pleistocene snail. Discus macclintocki.
Known only from Pleistocene fossils until 1978,
when this quarter-inch snail was discovered living
in a cave in northeastern Iowa.
Irukandji jellyfish. Carukia barnesi. Transpar-
ent, thumbnail-sized, Australian jellyfish now
thought to be responsible for Irukandji syndrome,
a set of symptoms that includes nausea, backache,
severe hypertension, abnormal heartbeat, and fluid
buildup in the lungs, apparently caused by a sting.
The syndrome was identified in 1952, but it
wasn’t until 1961 that Queensland marine biolo-
gist John Barnes caught this jellyfish and let it sting
him to see whether he developed the syndrome (he
did). Now thought to be a pelagic species that only
invades coastal waters occasionally. At least two
tourists in Queensland were killed by Irukandji
syndrome in the first four months of 2002; how-
ever, later tests on one of them, American Robert
King (who died in April), seemed to indicate that
the stings were not from Carukia barnesi but from
some other deadly jellyfish.
Jasus caveorum. A rock lobster discovered in
the summer of 1995 southwest of Easter Island in
the South Pacific.
Kauai cave wolf spider. Adelocosa anops. Eye-
less, orange-brown spider discovered in Koloa
Cave, Kauai, Hawaii, in 1973.
Limnognathia maerski. A new phylum, Mi-
crognathozoa, was created to accommodate this
0.1 -millimeter-long freshwater organism discov-
ered in a well on Disko Island, Greenland, in
1994. It is characterized by a set of complicated
jaws that it uses to scrape bacteria and algae off un-
derwater moss.
Lobatolampea tetragona. Two specimens of
comb jelly, caught along the shore of Ise-wan Bay
near Toba, Japan, in 1992, resembled no other
known genera and required the creation of a new
family, Lobatolampeidae.
Loricifera. A phylum of microscopic animals
described by Reinhardt Kristensen in 1983 to ac-
commodate Nanaloricus mysticus, discovered off
the coast of Brittany, France. These animals have
spiny heads and unsegmented bodies in a vase-
shaped anterior that can retract into the posterior
trunk. More than 100 species have been described
from marine sediments.
Mantophasmatodea. A new insect order was
created in 2002 to accommodate the discovery in
Namibia of a 1.6-inch predatory insect that looks
like a cross between a mantis, a grasshopper, and a
stick insect. Fossil specimens have also been dis-
covered in 4 5 -million-year-old Baltic amber.
Mediterranean carnivorous sponge. Asbesto-
pluma hypogea. A Mediterranean sponge discov-
ered in a sea cave 12 miles from Marseille, France,
in 1994; it uses its tendrils to seize and digest tiny
crustaceans that swim past.
650 ANIMALS DISCOVERED SINCE 1900
The Mimic octopus, discovered in Indonesia, can quickly camouflage itself as other sea creatures. (William M. Rehsamen)
Micromygale diblemma. The world s smallest
spider was discovered in Panama in 1983, requir-
ing the creation of a new subfamily. It breathes di-
rectly through its skin and has only two eyes.
Midgardia xandaros . The world’s largest
starfish is a deep-sea species discovered in the Gulf
of Mexico in 1969. It measures as much as 4 feet
6 inches from arm tip to arm tip.
Millennium bug. A new genus of water strider
in the Family Veliidae was discovered early in Jan-
uary 2000 by Nils Moller Andersen and Tom
Weir in freshwater streams in southeastern
Queensland and northeastern New South Wales,
Australia. This insect is less than one-tenth of an
inch long.
Mimic octopus. Octopus sp. Discovered in
Maumere Bay off the Indonesian island of Flores
in the mid-1990s, this octopus can camouflage
and manipulate itself to appear like a flounder, a
sea snake, a lionfish, a crab, an eel, or a jellyfish, all
in a matter of seconds.
Mljet moon jelly. Aurelia sp. nov. A new
species of moon jellyfish was discovered in January
2001 on the island of Mljet, Croatia, in the Adri-
atic Sea. Its closest relative also lives in an inland
lake, in the Philippines.
Mystacocarida. Subclass of wormlike crus-
taceans less than 1 millimeter long, first discovered
in 1943 between the intertidal sand grains of
beaches. Three species are known in a single
genus, Derocheilocharis.
Neoglyphea inopinata, Lobsterlike crustacean
collected in the South China Sea in 1908 that re-
mained unidentified until 1973, when it was rec-
ognized by Jacques Forest and Michele de Saint
Laurent as a glypheid, a member of a family
thought extinct for 50 million years.
Neopilina galatheae. A small mollusk that
looks like a limpet. Prior to its discovery off the
west coast of Mexico in 1952 by the crew of the
Danish research ship Galathea, no living represen-
tatives of the class of Paleozoic fossil mollusks
called monoplacophorans were known. Unlike
other mollusks, these animals are segmented and
have paired nerves, muscles, sex organs, and heart
chambers.
ANIMALS DISCOVERED SINCE 1900 651
Ophiocanops fugiens, Primitive, yellow-
banded brittle star discovered in 1922 off Jolo Is-
land in the Philippines.
Pheidole fuller ae. New species of ant discov-
ered in 1990 in a potted palm in the Washington,
D.C., office of Kathryn S. Fuller, president of the
U.S. branch of the World Wildlife Fund. Presum-
ably a South American species, its presence in a
palm from Florida has not been explained.
Platynus indecentis, A ground beetle discov-
ered in 1997 in the Cornell University collection,
where it had been misidentified as Platynus decen-
tis for decades. Found in bogs from Maine to
Maryland and from Ontario to Ohio. Christened
“indecentis” by James Leibherr and Kip Will, who
considered it “positively indecent” that this beetle
remained undetected by entomologists for so
long.
Pompeii worm. Alvinella pompejana. Poly-
chaete worm discovered in 1979 living in honey-
comb-like tubes near hydrothermal vents in the
abyssal East Pacific Rise. The most heat-loving
invertebrate known, this free-swimming worm
attaches itself to “black smoker” vents and can
withstand temperatures up to 100°C. On the op-
posite end of the temperature spectrum, the
Methane ice worm, Hesiocaeca methanicola , dis-
covered deep in the Gulf of Mexico in 1997, is
the only known animal to colonize methane hy-
drate ice.
Proturans. New class created in 1907 by Fil-
ippo Silvestri to describe some of the most primi-
tive insects, discovered in Genoa, Italy. No more
than one-tenth of an inch long, these soil-inhabit-
ing hexapods have no eyes or antennae. The larva
begins with nine body segments and acquires a
new one after each molt until it is an adult with
twelve segments. The first species to be recognized
was Acerentomon doderoi in 1907; since then, at
least 100 others have been described.
Queen Alexandra birdwing. Ornithoptera
alexandrae. The world’s largest butterfly was dis-
covered on the Popondetta Plain of Papua New
Guinea in 1906. Females average 8.2 inches across
the wings, though specimens up to 1 1 inches have
been collected. It is also the heaviest butterfly, at
.42 ounces. The female has chocolate-brown
wings edged with cream; the male is smaller, with
green, blue, and black markings.
Rock crawlers. Order Notoptera. An insect
order discovered in 1914. Sixteen species are
known in Canada, Japan, and Siberia, living at rel-
atively high altitudes between rocks and moss or in
cavities.
Sea wasp. Chironex fleckeri. A deadly box jelly-
fish, first identified as a distinct species in 1955
after one fatally stung a swimmer off Cardwell,
Queensland, Australia. The pain caused by its
stinging cells (nematocysts) is said to be excruciat-
ing, and death can occur within two or three min-
utes, often before the victim can struggle to the
shore. These animals can grow as large as 7 inches
in diameter, are square in shape, and have four
bundles of stinging tentacles that may extend up
to 6 feet.
Sheet- web weaver spiders. Ceraticelus sp. nov.
and Meioneta sp. nov. Two tiny new species of
Linyphiid spider were discovered by Thomas
Prentice in two Lake County forest preserves
north of Chicago, Illinois, in early 2000.
Spelaeogriphus lepidops . A long, cylindrical
crustacean discovered in 1955 in a freshwater
stream that flows through Bat Cave in Table
Mountain, South Africa. The discovery required
the creation of a new order, Spelaeogriphacea.
Two other living species and two fossil species are
known.
Speleonectes lucayensis, A small, millipede-like
crustacean that lives in underwater caves in the Ba-
hamas. Its discovery in 1979 required the creation
of a new class, Remipedia.
Sperosoma giganteum. The world’s largest sea
urchin was first described in 1907 from specimens
found off Omai Sakai lighthouse in Japan. The
shell’s horizontal diameter is up to 13 inches.
Sponge-dwelling shrimp. Synalpheus regalis.
Discovered by J. Emmett Duffy in June 1996, this
creature was living inside the internal canals of
sponges in the barrier reef off Belize. The first
known instance of eusociality in a crustacean.
Steigman’s crayfish. Procambarus sub gei-
ardiella steigmani. This new species of crayfish,
with a cherry-red back and light-blue sides, was
discovered in northern Texas in 1990 by Ken
Steigman.
Stygiomedusa fabulosa. A 5 -foot- wide jellyfish
that trails tentacles measuring 6 feet long, this an-
imal was brought up from a depth of more than
9,000 feet in the Bay of Biscay in the Atlantic in
1959.
Tear-drinking moth. Hypochrosis baenzigeri.
An odd moth, first described in 1982, that jabs its
652 ANIMALS DISCOVERED SINCE 1900
proboscis into the eyes of elephants and absorbs
moisture and salt from the tears.
Thermosbaenaceans. An order of tiny, shrimp-
like crustaceans discovered in the Hel Hamma hot
spring in Tunisia in 1927.
Thiomargarita namibiensis. The largest
known bacterium, measuring up to 0.3 inch
across, was discovered in 1998 in oceanic ooze at a
depth of 328 feet off Walvis Bay, Namibia, by the
crew of the Russian vessel Petr Kottsov. It grows in
strands of single cells that are several feet long, and
it feeds on sulfur.
Tubeworms. Subphylum Pogonophora was
created in 1944 to accommodate the discovery
thirty years earlier of a threadlike, transparent,
deep-sea worm recovered by the crew of the Dutch
ship Siboga and named Sibloglinum weberi. More
than 100 species have since been described. They
are the only known multicellular organisms with-
out a digestive tube. Most species live in the sea
below 300 feet in vertical, secreted tubes, often in
dense aggregations. The largest are the Giant vent
tubeworms ( Riftia pachyptila).
Vampire moth. Calyptra eustrigata. Discovered
in Malaysia in 1926, this moth uses its proboscis
to suck the blood of mammalian hosts. Its dietary
preference was not noted until 1967, when Swiss
entomologist Hans Banziger found one on the
flank of a tapir in the Kuala Lumpur zoo.
Vampire squid. Vampyroteuthis infernalis. First
collected in 1903, this deep-sea squid has charac-
teristics of both octopuses and squids. Between 3
and 12 inches in length, it has the consistency of a
jellyfish. Its name comes from its eerie look: glit-
tering red eyes, a purplish web connecting its eight
arms, and two retractile filaments that can extend
to lengths well in excess of the total length of the
animal and retract into pockets.
Wallace’s giant bee. Megachile pluto. The
world’s largest bee, more than 1.5 inches long, was
discovered in 1859 on the island of Bacan in the
Molucca Islands of Indonesia by Alfred Russel
Wallace. It was not seen again for more than 100
years. In February 1981, it was rediscovered on
nearby Halmahera, Indonesia, by Adam C.
Messer, who studied it for the first time in its nat-
ural habitat. The bee makes its home inside active
treetop termite nests.
Zorapterans. An insect order first described in
1913. Adults are barely 3 millimeters long and re-
semble small termites. They form small colonies be-
neath tree bark or in soil cavities. The twenty- two
known species belong to a single genus ( Zorotypus ).

ANIMALS DISCOVERED SINCE 1900
Lake and River Monsters
This section provides a fairly comprehensive list of
all freshwater bodies (lakes, rivers, streams,
swamps) in which a large aquatic or amphibious
unknown animal is said to have been seen, either
in recent times or long ago. A total of 884 mon-
ster-infested bodies of water are included; the high
percentages of those in Europe (30 percent) and
North America (41 percent) are most likely attrib-
utable to Western-language bias, especially En-
glish. Brief descriptions or examples of sightings
are given when known, along with as primary a
source as could be located. Cryptids that are cov-
ered in the A-Z section of this encyclopedia are
given a “see ...” reference (for example, Lake
Champlain. See Champ) . Entries are not restricted
to the familiar Loch Ness-type animals; anything
large and mysterious has been included.

was seen during storms. Later, a steamer captain
convinced him he had seen a dead hippo, bloated
