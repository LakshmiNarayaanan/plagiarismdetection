Types of Plagiarism
• Intentional
– Copying a friend’s work
– Buying or borrowing papers
– Cutting and pasting blocks of text from electronic
sources without documenting
– Media “borrowing "without documentation
– Web publishing without permissions of creators
• Unintentional
– Careless paraphrasing
– Poor documentation
– Quoting excessively
– Failure to use your own “voice
11.
Avoiding Plagiarism: Quoting
Quotations are the exact words of an author, copied
directly from a source, word for word. Quotations must
be cited!
Use quotations when:
• You want to add the power of an author’s words to support
your argument
• You want to disagree with an author’s argument
• You want to highlight particularly eloquent or powerful
phrases or passages
• You are comparing and contrasting specific points of view
• You want to note the important research that precedes
your own
12.
Avoiding Plagiarism: Paraphrasing
Paraphrasing means rephrasing the words of an author,
putting his/her thoughts in your own words.
When you paraphrase, you rework the source’s ideas,
words, phrases, and sentence structures with your own.
Like quotations, paraphrased material must be followed
with in-text documentation and cited on your Works-Cited
page.
Paraphrase when:
• You plan to use information on your note cards and wish to
avoid plagiarizing
• You want to avoid overusing quotations
• You want to use your own voice to present information
13.
Avoiding Plagiarism: Summarizing
• Summarizing involves putting the main idea(s) of
one or several writers into your own words,
including only the main point(s).
• Summaries are significantly shorter than the
original and take a broad overview of the source
material. Again, it is necessary to attribute
summarized ideas to their original sources.
Summarize when:
• You want to establish background or offer an overview of a topic
• You want to describe knowledge (from several sources) about a
topic
• You want to determine the main ideas of a single source
