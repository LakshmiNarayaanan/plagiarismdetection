SJR
The SJR is a size-independent prestige indicator that ranks journals by their 'average prestige per article'. It is based on the idea that 'all citations are not created equal'. SJR is a measure of scientific influence of journals that accounts for both the number of citations received by a journal and the importance or prestige of the journals where such citations come from
It measures the scientific influence of the average article in a journal, it expresses how central to the global scientific discussion an average article of the journal is.
