COURSE OBJECTIVES
 
 

 
Digital Electronics is the study of electronic circuits that are used to process and control 
digital signals. In contrast to analog electronics, where information is represented b
y a 
continuously varying voltage, digital signals are represented by two discreet voltages or 
logic levels.  
 

 
This distinction allows for greater signal speed and storage capabilities and has 
revolutionized the world electronics.  Digital electronics is th
e foundation of all modern 
electronic devices such as cellular phones, MP3 players, laptop computers, digital cameras, 
high definition televisions, etc.
 

 
The major focus of this course is to expose students to the design process of combinational 
and sequent
ial logic design, teamwork, communication methods, engineering standards, and 
technical documentation.

LIST OF EXPERIMENTS
 
1.
 
Develop Rational number class in  Java.    Use JavaDoc comments for documentation.  
Your 
implementation should use efficient representation for a rational number, i.e. (500 / 
1000) should be represented as (½).  
 
2.
 
Develop Date class in Java similar to the one available in java.util package.  Use JavaDoc 
comments. 
 
3.
 
Implement Lisp
-
like List in  J
ava.   Write basic operations such as 'car',  'cdr', and 'cons'.  If 
L is a list [3, 0, 2, 5], L.car() returns 3, while L.cdr() returns [0,2,5].  
 
4.
 
Design a Java interface for ADT Stack.  Develop two different classes that implement this 
interface, one usin
g array and the other using linked
-
list.  Provide necessary exception 
handling in both the implementations.  
 
5.
 
Design a Vehicle class hierarchy in Java.  Write a test program to demonstrate 
polymorphism. 
 
6.
 
Design classes for Currency, Rupee, and Dollar.  Wri
te a program that randomly generates  
Rupee  and  Dollar  objects  and  write  them  into  a  file  using  object serialization. Write 
another program to read that file, convert to Rupee if it reads a Dollar, while leave the value 
as it is if it reads a Ru
pee.  
 
7.
 
Design a scientific calculator using event
-
driven programming paradigm of Java. 
 
8.
 
rite a multi
-
threaded Java program to print all numbers below 100,000 that are both prime 
and fibonacci number (some examples are 2, 3, 5, 13, etc.).  Design a thread t
hat generates 
prime numbers below 100,000 and writes them into a pipe.  Design  another  thread  that  
generates  fibonacci  numbers  and  writes  them  to  another  pipe.   The main thread should 
read both the pipes to identify numbers common to both.

COURSE OBJECTIVES
 
 
 
The major objective of thi
s lab is to provide a strong formal foundation in database 
concepts, technology and practice to the participants to groom them into well
-
informed database 
application developers. Rather than imparting isolated knowledge/experience fragments in each of 
conc
epts, technology and practice, the course will aim at achieving a good blend of the three. The 
overriding concern, therefore, is to include just enough concepts and theory to motivate and enrich 
the practical component, and to include technology component 
to maximize the relevance of the 
course to the industry without sacrificing the long
-
term objectives of rigour and foundational 
strength that can withstand the vagaries of technological advances. The sub
-
objectives are:
 

 
To give a good formal foundation on 
the relational model of data
 

 
To present SQL and procedural interfaces to SQL comprehensively
 

 
To give an introduction to systematic database design approaches covering conceptual 
design,  logical design and an overview of physical design
 

 
To motivate the par
ticipants to relate all these to one or more commercial product 
environments as they relate to the developer tasks
 

 
To present the concepts and techniques relating to query processing by SQL engines
 

 
To present the concepts and techniques relating to ODBC an
d its implementations.
 

 
To introduce the concepts of transactions and transaction processing
 

 
To present the issues and techniques relating to concurrency and recovery in multi
-
user 
database environments
 
 
COURSE OUTCOMES
 
 
CO1:
  
Demonstrate the basic fundamen
tals of Structured Query Language (SQL).
 
CO2:
 
 
Employ the conceptual and relational models to design large database systems.
 
CO3:
 
 
Design and build database system for a given real world problem.

oriented software devel
opment industry has gone through the process of 
standardizing visual modeling notations. The Unified Modeling Language (UML), a 
modeling language for specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting, is the 
product of this effort. It unifies the nota
tions that currently exist in the industry. Therefore, 
every computer scientist, and especially every software engineer should have contact with 
UML during his or her studies.
 
 

 
It offers a common language uniting different object
-
oriented software developm
ent 
methodologies in terms of notation and vocabulary. It provides a rich set of notations that 
can be used to describe many different aspects of the software under development, 
including complex concurrency and distribution.

represents an object
-
oriented system using a number of modeling views. 
 

 
Construct various UML models (including use case diagrams, class diagrams, interaction 
 
diagrams, state chart diagrams, activity diagrams, and implementation diagrams) using 
 
the appropriate notation. Recognize the difference between various object relatio
nships: 
 
inheritance, association, whole
-
part, and dependency relationships.

COURSE OBJECTIVES
 
 
This course covers fundamental principles of energy management faced by designers of 
hardware, operating systems, and data centers. We will explore basic energy management option in 
individual compo
nents such as CPUs, network interfaces, hard drives, memory. We will further 
present the energy management policies at the operating system level that consider performance vs. 
energy saving tradeoffs. Finally we will consider large scale data centers where
 
energy 
management is done at multiple layers from individual components in the system to shutting down 
entries subset of machines. We will also discuss energy generation and delivery and well as cooling 
issues in large data centers.
