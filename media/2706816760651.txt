About the Program
In a 35-credit hour program of evening classes, students with an undergraduate degree in engineering (or a degree in math, computer science or a physical science coupled with at least two years experience in engineering after the completion of their undergraduate degree) can learn to manage the engineering function and the technology assets of their organizations by earning a master of science in Engineering Management. Students who already have a graduate degree in mechanical, electrical, industrial, manufacturing, or another branch of engineering can pursue the Engineering Management program for even greater mastery of both technology and the principles of management.
The program may be completed entirely on campus, entirely online, or through a combination of on-campus and online courses.
Program Goals
Provide an understanding of core management areas vital for a technical manager, e.g., marketing, accounting, organizational behavior, business ethics/law, finance.
Provide knowledge of topics inherent and common to all engineering disciplines, e.g., systems engineering, total quality management, production management, management of product/process design.
Provide the requisite knowledge and skills to manage the engineering function at both lower and upper levels of management.
Provide experience in integrating technical and management aspects in “real life” engineering project or problem.
