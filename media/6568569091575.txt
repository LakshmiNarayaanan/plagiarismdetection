In general Autonomic computing systems 
reveal following
 
important
 
characteristics:
 

 
Self Awareness
: An a
utonomic system knows itself,
 
its 
states and its 
behavior
.
 

 
Self Configuration
: An autonomic 
computing system should be able to configure itself in changing and unpredictable 
conditions.
 

 
Self Optimization
: An autonomic system should be able to perceive optimal behavior and optimize itself to improve its
 
performance.
 

 
Self 
Healing
: An
 
autonomic system should be able to 
sense and recover from
 
possible
 
problems and continue to function 
smoothly.
  
 

 
Self Protection
: An autonomic system should be able to sense and 
defend
 
its resources from 
domestic
 
and 
outside
 
attacks 
and to 
preserve
 
overal
l system security and integrity.
 

 
Background
 
Aware
: An autonomic computing system must be aware of its working 
context
 
and
 
should be capable of 
reacting on
 
changes.
 
 

 
Flexibility

ETWORK
 
A wireless sensor network is the accumulation of sensor 
nodes deployed over globe to investigate physical parameters like 
humidity, temperature, seismic events, vibrations etc. Since the scope of WSN is so broad, there is 
a considerable variation 
in 
hardware/software solution space of WSN technology. A simplifi
ed view of hardware/software helps develop a basic 
understanding of how these systems work. Most WSNs are multi
-
hop networks and rely on a communication stack that includes 
Media Access Control (MAC), routing and transport layers. There are many protocols 
for each of these layers, but they are not the 
same protocols found in wired networks or even Wi
-
Fi networks. 
 
The WSN was initially coined for military and heavy industrial applications in around 1950s. A Sound
 Surveillance System 
(SOSUS) was the first ne
twork developed by US Military forces to track Russian submarines. 
This network used submerged 
acoustic sensors 
Œ
 
hydrophones 
Œ
 
distributed in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
 
1960s
-
70s was the period of internet exploration 
which we see today. 
 
The Distri
buted Sensor Network
 
program (1980) was launched by US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to 
explore the challenges in the implementation of
 
sensor networks. 
The idea of distributed sensor networks was initially made with 
an assumption that 
several tiny devices called nodes team
-
up with each other to deliver the information which was routed to them 
based on best availability. Both academic and industry predicted the potential of this field and mad
e joint venture to solve 
the 
difficulty in thi
s type of systems.  Several examples include UCLA 
Wireless Integrated Network Sensors
 
University of California 
at Berkeley Pico Radio program (1999), NASA Sensor Zig Bee Alliance (2002) etc. 
WSN™s have drawn a huge interest since 
1998, in this new trend of
 
research networking capability and network information handling were the prime area of research. A 
wireless sensor network is collection of large number of sensor nodes with sensing, communication an
d computing capabilities.
 
The sensor nodes are distribut
ed in a hostile environment to gather data about physical characteristic of the field. The collected
 by 
these sensor nodes can be collected a base station or several sink nodes linked to the network. The 
operation of WSN has been
 
shown in fig.1. The sensor
 
nodes can either form a flat network topology or a hierarchical network topology [13].

AUTONOMIC 
WSN
 
IBM proposed an automatic computing method to 
transfer the burden of humans to managing computer systems
 
[13
]. At the 
high complex levels the computers are organized to manage themselves. This could only be achieved on
ly by making the machines
 
capable enough to take decisions with respect to self
-
heal
ing, self
-
protection, configuration and optimization, and feeding them 
with enough raw data to the machines. 
 
The computer systems are deployed in wireless sensor networks as they are hard to manage with human 
efforts. In the large 
networks of WSN the mana
gement of nodes experience severe effects of environmental vulnerabilities, complex processing 
mechanisms and results in unreliable and lacking robustness. Administration with computer applicatio
n would greatly benefit w
ith 
their inherent automation method
s in the implementation of sensor networks
 
[14
].
 
Intelligent agents [15
] proposed one of the core technologies to enable autonomic computing. A class of software was entir
ely 
capable of displaying goal
-
directed, cooperative and autonomous behavior in respo
nse to external stimuli. The mechanism was 
composed of sense
-
deliberate
-
act cycle, which maps well onto WSNs whereas the sensor nodes sample the data to use as input in 
decision making process. 
 
The contribution of autonomic computing to WSNs can be explai
ned by following scenarios in which a common WSN problem 
in WSN operation can be tackled using autonomic principles. 
 

 
It is assumed that nodes constituting the network can never be perfectly positioned. Hence self conf
iguring nodes are setup 
and the gap in
 
WSN can be evaluated either by sens
ing or networking viewpoint. [16
] Provides an example of this, a 
protocol for automatically building a network out of randomly distributed nodes. 
 

 
Self
-
protection attribute monitors voltage levels remotely or locally so 
that the agent can avoid being lost n any manner.
 

 
The ability to repair damage to the network is called self healing. The harsher conditions results t
o energy depletion and 
incidental damage. A gradual degradation of network, network path break and gaps ap
pear in sensing coverage area. The 
WSN requires to self
-
heal itself and repair the damaged area. Renegotiating network routes, activation of redundant nodes
 
and informing a higher authority are some of the methods in to minimize loss in this context.
 

 
Maxim
um efficiency is a necessary factor in WSN. The self
-
optimization technique is an important trait against this. A 
low bound quality of service can be provided by re
-
enabling the redundant sensor nodes that go to low power sleep mode 
and results in same acc
uracy and service quality. This reduces the energy consumption of the network to a great extent
 
[[17

The Ad hoc On

Demand Distance Vector (AODV) [5] procedure allows self

AODV permits mobile nodes to find paths rapidly for novel destinations, and does not necessitate nod
es to preserve paths to 
destinations that are not in dynamic comm
unication.  It also permits the mobile nodes to reply to link changes and breakages in 
network topology in a timely mode. The procedure of AODV is loop
-
free, by means of keeping away the Bellman

Ford "counting 
to infinity" problem offers rapid convergence 
as any change is encountered in the ad hoc network topology (normally, when a node 
moves in the network).  Whenever a break is detected, AODV noticed the affected set of nodes in orde
r to separate them from r
out 
formation by utilizing the lost link.

AODV 
has a specific feature, it use a destination sequence number for all route entry, destination sequen
ce number is generated 
by the destination to be involved along with any route data it sends to requesting nodes.  The purpo
se of this sequence numbe
ring is 
to confirms the loop freedom and is modest to program. For instance consider two routes to a destina
tion, the requesting node
 
is 
mandatory to pick the one with the highest sequence number.
 
 
Route Errors (RERRs), Route Replies (RREPs) and Route Requests (RR
EQs) are the message categories explained by AODV.  
These types of message are received through UDP, and normal IP header processing applies. For exampl
e let us consider a 
requesting node is likely to use its IP address as the Originator IP address for the
 
messages.  The IP limited broadcast address 
(255.255.255.255) is used to broadcast the message. By this we can conclude that such messages are n
ot carelessly forwarded. 
 
But, 
AODV process does need certain messages (e.g., RREQ) to be spread widely, possib
ly throughout the ad hoc network.  The variety 
of dissemination of such RREQs is demonstrated by the TTL in the IP header. Fragmentation is normall
y not needed.
 
 
As long as the terminating points of a communication assembly have lawful routes to each other
, AODV does not play any role. 
When a path to a novel destination is required, the node broadcasts a RREQ to discover a path to the
 destination. 
 
A route is obtained as the RREQ touches either the destination itself or with the help of an interme
diate node
 
with a 'fresh 
enough' route to the destination.  A 'fresh enough' route is a lawful route entry for the destinatio
n whose related sequence 
number is 
at least as large as that comprised in the RREQ.  The route is made accessible by unicasting a RREP 
again 
to the origination of the 
RREQ. Each of the node present in the communication field receive the request caches a route back to
 the creator of the reque
st, so 
that the RREP can be unicast from the destination along a path to that originator, or likewise fro
m any intermediate node that is able 
to satisfy the request.
 
Nodes that are monitoring the link conditions of next hops in termed as active routes.  The RERR mes
sage is used to alert oth
er 
nodes as any break is encountered in an active route.  The RERR mes
sage specifies those possibly subnets (destinations) which are 
no longer accessible by way of the broken link.  In order to permit this reporting mechanism, each n
ode hold onto a "precurso
r list", 
encompassing the IP address for each its friends that are e
xpected to use it as a next hop in the direction of each destination. The 
data in the precursor lists is effortlessly acquired in the course of the processing for generation 
of a RREP message, which 
by 
definition has to be delivered to a node in a precurso
r list.  If the RREP carries a nonzero prefix period, then the originator of the 
RREQ which solicited the RREP information is comprised among the precursors for the subnet route.
 
AODV is a routing protocol, and it agreements with route table administration
. Route table data should be reserved even for 
short
-
lived routes, such as are produced to temporarily store reverse paths towards nodes originating RREQ
s.  AODV utilizes the 
subsequent fields with each route table entry:

Wireless Sensor Network has witnessed increasing demand in several applications such as environmenta
l monitoring, military 
field surveillance, forest fire detection and many m
ore.  These applications require deployment of several small sensor nodes in 
hostile environment to constantly monitor numerous parameters like temperature, pressure etc. These 
sensor modes transmit 
sensing information to a central administrator called bas
e station. Due to densely situated nodes and hostile nature of environment 
it is difficult to recharge node batteries. Hence energy efficiency is prime concern in designing a 
WSN.   In some applicatio
ns it is 
not necessary to transmit all the sensed inform
ation to the base station instead mutual information of different nodes is used to 
calculate aggregate information which is then transmitted to the observer. This aggregation of data 
reduces overhead in netwo
rk 
and saves significant amount of energy as wel
l. Clustering is a method in which network is partitioned into several number of 
small groups called cluster, each cluster has a cluster head (central coordinator) and number of par
ticipant nodes. Clusterin
g is a 
hierarchical approach, in which cluster hea
d is tier
-
1 member while participant nodes are tier
-
2 members.

Member nodes transmit their information to cluster head and cluster head performs aggregation operat
ion and send this 
information to base station. Due to continual process of aggregation and transmission cluster head l
ooses more energy compare
d 
to particip
ating nodes. Hence re
-
clustering is required periodically to select cluster heads with maximum residual energy. Optimal 
clustering may improve network lifetime and results in better network performance under the conditio
n of high loads.
 
Consider
 
a wireless sensor ne
twork with different amount of initial energy
 
[11]
.
 
We present the energy model and particle swarm 
optimization based optimal clustering to improve network lifetime. 
According to heterogeneous clustering model presented in 
[11] a
ssume 
that 
a
 
fraction
 
of 
population 
of sensor nodes is equipped with more energy resources than the rest of the nodes. 
 
Let 
m
 
be the fraction of the total number of nodes
 
n

these powerful n
odes as adv
anced nodes, and the rest(1
-
m)
×n as normal nodes. We assume that all nodes are distributed 
uniformly over the sensor field.
 
Consider the case of hierarchical clustering in WSN using Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (
LEACH) protocol. 
Acco
rding to LEACH, load balancing and distribution between the nodes is done by re
-
establishment of clusters in each round.  
Each participating node in cluster is accountable only to its nearest cluster
-
head and only cluster
-
head is responsible to report to 
t
he base station. This process requires a large amount of energy and hence by periodic clustering eac
h node will become cluste
r 
head. In iter
ative 
process for each round optimal percentage P
opt
 
of nodes
 
which 
will become cluster
-
heads is calculated. 
Assumin

P

as number of cycles of network, LEACH 
ensures that every 
node will become cluster
-
head one time after 
every 1

cycle.
 
Initially 


 
is the probability with which 
each node in the network can be a cluster head. At an average 
number
 
of nodes that must be selected to become cluster head per cycle per epochs is

×


.
 
Currently elected nodes cannot be 
elected as cluster head in same epoch and non
-
elected nodes forms a set G to maintain uniform number of cluster heads. At the 
begin
ning of every cycle each node chose a random number between [0, 1] and based on this number if it is
 less than a threshold 
T(s) then the node becomes cluster head during current cycle.
 
The threshold is given as

In pending packet table, each node maintains track of the packets, it sent. It contains a unique pac
ket ID, the address of th
e next hop 
to which the packet was forwarded, address of the destination node, and an expiry time after which a
 still
-
existing pack
et in the 
buffer is considered not forwarder by the next hop.   
 
In node rating table, each node maintains rating of nodes, which are next to it (means nodes are wit
hin its communication 
range). This table includes the node address, a counter of dropped pa
ckets noticed at this node and a counter of successfully 
forwarded packets by this node.  
 
The fourth field of the above node rating table is calculated by the ratio of dropped packets and su
ccessfully forwarded pack
ets, 
if this ratio is greater than a giv
en threshold value then this node misbehave value will be 1 (means it is interpreted as a 
misbehaving node), otherwise it is deliberated as a legitimate node. An expired packet in the pendin
g packet table causes the
 
packet 
drops counter to increase for the
 
next hop correlated with the pending packet table entry. Each node listens to packets that are insid
e 
its communication range, and only to packets associated to its domain. Then, it checks each packet a
nd prevent forged packet.
 
If it 
notices a data packet
 
in its pending packet table, then it deletes this data packet from pending packet table after authen
ticating the 
packet. If it notices a data packet that exits in its pending packet table with source address diffe
rent from the forwarding 
node 
address, the
n it increases the packet forwarding value in node rating table. 
 
For determining whether a node is misbehaving or act as a legitimate one, rest on the selection of t
hreshold value.  For exam
ple 
if we assume a threshold value of 0.5. This means that as lon
g as a misbehaving node is transmitting twice packets as it drops it will 
not be distinguish. If we assume a lower value of threshold then it will increase the percentages of
 false positives. After f
inding a 
misbehaving node, a node will attempt to do loca
l repair for all routes passing through this misbehaving node. If local repair 
process fails, then it will not transmit any RERR packet upstream in the network. This process attem
pts to prevent a misbehav
ing 
node from dropping packets, and also prevent bla
ckmailing of legitimate nodes. To avoid constructing routes, which traverse 
misbehaving nodes, nodes drop all RREP messages arriving from nodes currently marked as misbehaving.
 To stop misbehaving 
node to act actively in a network, the all packet starting 
from this node has been 
dropped as a form of punishment
.

RANSACTIONAL SECURIT
Y IN AODV BASED 
W
SN
 
 
Encryption has an important role in data protection for WSN. The importance of encryption realized w
ith increasing 
communication. Encryption makes sense w
hen data packets using open channels, which they can be reached by other devices or 
people, to transfer their contents. An Encryption system contains set of transformations that conver
t plain text into cipher 
text. In 
the block cipher system, plain text co
nverts into blocks that cipher algorithm applies on them to create cipher text. The block 
cipher systems divided into two general principles: Diffusion and Confusion. 
 
In Diffusion principle, each bit of plain text converts into many bits. However, in Conf
usion principle, number of bits doesn't 
change and only transformations apply to plain text, hence in Confusion principle, size of plain tex
t and cipher text is equa
l. 
Usually both principle uses round repetition to create cipher text. Cipher algorithms ha
ve the two general categories: Private Key 
algorithms and public key algorithms. Private Key algorithms using single key to encrypt plain text 
and decrypt cipher text i
n 
sender and receiver side. Private Key algorithm samples are: DES, 3DES and Advanced En
cryption Standard (AES). Public Key 
algorithms, such as the Rivest
-
Shamir
-
Adleman (RSA), using two different key for encrypt plain text and decrypt cipher text in 
sender and receiver sides. Block cipher systems depend on the S
-
Boxes, which are fixed and no
 
relation with a cipher key. So 
only changeable parameter is cipher key. Since the only nonlinear component of AES is S
-
Boxes, they are an important source of 
cryptographic strength. So we develop a chaos S
-
box based AES system to provide transactional sec
urity to AODV based WSN 
system.
 
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a symmetric
-
key block cipher algorithm and a U.S. government standard for secure and 
classified data encryption and decryption. AES has three fixed 128
-
bit block ciphers with cryptograph
ic key sizes of 128, 192 and 
256 bits. Key size is unlimited, whereas the block size maximum is 256 bits. A data block to be encr
ypted by AES is split int
o an 
array of bytes, and each encryption operation is byte oriented. AES's round function consists of 
four layers. In the first layer, an 
8x8 S
-
box is applied to each byte. The second and third layers are linear mixing layers in which the rows 
of the array are shifted,
 
and the columns are mixed. In the fourth layer, sub
-
key bytes are XORed into each byte o
f the array. In the last round, the column 
mixing is omitted. So, the algorithm consists of four main steps: a substitution step, a shift row s
tep, a mix column step an
d a sub
-
key addition step. The substitution step consists of S
-
boxes. The shift row step
 
consists of cyclic shifting of the bytes within the 
rows. The key addition is a straight forward XOR operation between the data and the key.

ONCLUSION
 
 
 
The paper proposes a novel method for autonomic computing in WSN by three features Self
-
optimization, self
-
protection and 
transactional security. 
The proposed 
approach for self
-
optimization uses PSO based cluster head selection for efficient network 
lifetime. Results show that proposed system outperforms the existing cluster head selection methods 
in terms of network 
throughput, end to end delivery ratio and net
work lifetime.
 
Watch mechanism based approach is proposed for self
-
protection by 
monitoring malicious nodes and black hole detection.
 
It is depicted in results that how the existence of malicious nodes affects the 
system performance. Furthermore Chaos base
d AES cryptography has been proposed to provide transactional security to the 
network. Simulation has been carried out on MATLAB. The overall impact of aforementioned schemes is 
to provide Transactional 
security and to enhance network lifetime by applying 
autonomic characteristics to WSN.
