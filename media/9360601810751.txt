Abstract:
 
The aptitude to select those standings from a given assembly that are most telltale of geographic 
location is of key reputation in efficaciously addressing this task.This proc
edure of selecting spatially relevant 
terms is at present not well understood, and the popular of current systems are based on regular term selection 
methods.They propose two classes of term assortment methods based on standard geostatistical techniques.To
 
implement the idea of spatial flattening of term existences, consider the use of kernel density estimation (KDE) to 
model each term as a two
-
dimensional possibility circulation over the surface of the Earth.Gazetteers have 
customarily been the main tool t
o assess the geographic  scope of textual properties.Modalities in which 

govern the selections with respect to vision applications.The likeness 
between the two maps creating one jump to 
the supposition that the more populous regions frequently invite greater levels of photographic action.

Data mining is a step in the process of knowledge discovery consisting of applying data analysis 
and
 
discovery algorithms that, under acceptable computational efficiency limitations, produce a particular 
enumeration of patterns and relationships in large data sets. These tools can include statistical models, 
mathematical algorithms, and machine learning 
methods (algorithms that improve their performance 
automatically through experience, such as neural networks or decision trees). Consequently, data mining 
consists of more than collecting and managing data, it also includes analysis and prediction.
 
The mos
t common one is in the form of a large number of observations (cases). Real world 
applications usually are large in respect of the number of variables (dimensions) that are represented in 
the data set. Data mining is also concerned with this side of largen
ess. Especially in the field of 
bioinformatics, many data sets compromise only a small number of cases but large number of variables. 
Secondary analysis implies that the data can rarely be regarded as a random sample from the population 
of interest and may
 
have quite large selection biases. The primary focus in investigating from a small 
sample to a large universe, but more likely partitioning the large sample into homogeneous subsets.
 
Geotagging is the process of recognizing textual references to geographi
c locations, known as toponyms, 
and resolving these references by assigning each lat/long values. Typical geotagging algorithms use a 
variety of heuristic evidence to
 
select the correct interpretation for each toponym
. A study is presented of 
one such heuristic which aids in recognizing and resolving lists of toponyms, referred to as comma 
groups. Comma groups of toponyms are recognized and resolved by
 
inferring the
 
common threads
 
that 
bind them together, based
 
on the

hand with
 
an increased interest in geographic 
information retrieval.
 
Indeed, as more information about the location of users
 
becomes available, there is 
a gro
wing need to identify the
 
geographic scope of web resources: A promotion for United
 
Kingdom 
railway tickets may be of little interest to a user in
 
Australia, while photos of Portland Timbers games 
may
 
mainly be of interest to residents of Portland. Gazette
ers
 
have traditionally been the main tool to 
assess the
 
geographic scope of textual resources. However, gazetteers
 
are limited to manually compiled 
lists of toponyms, which
 
are necessarily restricted in scope. Many local landmarks or
 
geographic features 
ma
y not be contained in these lists, and
 
vernacular places names and events are often not accounted
 
for. 
Moreover, apart from place names and events, there may
 
be a variety of other textual cues that can be 
used to estimate
 
the geographic scope of a resource
, such as slang words,
 
regional product names, and so 
on.
 
Our aim in this section is to introduce a number of
 
measures to identify Flickr tags that relate to location. 
Such
 
tags can refer to toponyms (e.g., 
Paris
, 
France
, 
Mediterranean
),
 
but also to geogra
phic features (e.g., 
beach, forest, lake),
 
names of landmarks (e.g., empire
 
state
 
building, 
Eiffel 
tower),
 
events (e.g., 911, 
ironman), slang words, and so on. For each
 
of these types of tags, the distribution of tag occurrences 
should deviate substantiall

as birthday party or iphone. Nonetheless, in

many cases, there may be several grid cells that contain a large number of tag occurrences. Classical term 
selection techniques are poorly equipped to differentiate between situa
tions where these
 
cells define a 
small number of regions and situations where such cells occur at many different places. The geospread 
measure, on the other hand, does explicitly look for clusters of grid cells, but is difficult to interpret.

1.Georeferencing Wikipedia Pages Using Language Models from Flickr
 
             
The task of assigning geographic coordinates to web resourceshas recen
tly gained in popularity. 
In particular, several recent initiativeshave focused on the use of language models for georeferencing 
Flickrphotos, with promising results. Such techniques, however, require theavailability of large numbers 
of spatially grounded 
training data. Theyare therefore not directly applicable for georeferencing other 
types of resources, such as Wikipedia pages. As an lternative, in this paper weexplore the idea of using 
language models that are trained on Flickrphotos for finding the coor
dinates of Wikipedia pages. Our 
experimentalresults show that the resulting method is able to outperform popularmethods that are based 
on gazetteer look
-
up.
 
The geographic scope of a web resource plays an increasingly important role forassessing its releva
nce in 
a given context, as can be witnessed by the popularityof location
-
based services on mobile devices. When 
uploading a photo to Flickr,for instance, users can explicitly add geographical coordinates to indicate 
whereit has been taken. Similarly, when 
posting messages on Twitter, information maybe added about the 
user's location at that time.

Our method, on the other hand, only usesinformation that was obtained from freely available, user
-
contributed data, inthe form of georeferenced Flickr photos, and 
uses standard language 
modelingtechniques.These results suggest that the implicit spatial information that arises fromthe tagging 
behavior of users may have a stronger role to play in the eld of geographic information retrieval, which is 
currently still do
minated by gazetteerbased approaches. Moreover, as the number of georeferenced Flickr 
photos isconstantly increasing, the spatial models that could be derived are constantly improving. Further 
work is needed to compare the information contained implicitlyi
n such language models with the explicit 
information contained in gazetteers.
 
The reason isthat typically there is only one Wikipedia page about a given location, so eitherits location is 
already known or its location cannot be found by using othergeorefer
enced pages. Moreover, due to the 
smaller number of georeferenced pages and the large number of spatiallyirrelevant terms on a typical 
Wikipedia page, the process further complicates.

Exploring Place through User Generated Content: Using Flickr to Desc
ribe City Cores
 
         
Terms used to describe city centers, such asDowntown, are key concepts in everydayor vernacular 
language. Here, we explore such language by harvesting georeferencedand tagged metadata associated 
with 8 million Flickr images and thu
s consider how largenumbers of people name city core areas. The 
nature of errors and imprecision in taggingand georeferencing are quantified, and automatically generated 
precisionmeasures appearto mirror errors in the ositioning of images. Users seek to as
cribe appropriate 
semanticsto images, though bulk
-
uploading and bulk
-
tagging may introduce bias. Between 0.5

2%of tags 
associated with georeferenced images analyzed describe city core areas generically,while 70% of all 
georeferenced images analyzed include
 
specific place name tags, withplace names at the granularity of 
city names being by far the most common.
 
Exploring commonsense notions requires that we have access to descriptions whichsomehow reflect 
vernacular usage. One data source with considerable po
tential in GIScienceis so called user generated 
content (UGC) or, perhaps more specifically, volunteeredgeographic information (VGI). Both UGC and 
VGI are essentially data uploaded to theweb by individuals, such as YouTube videos, Open Street Map 
data, or 
Flickr images andtags. References to location may be stored as (potentially) unambiguous 
coordinates orreferences to place names in the form of, for example, tags or titles, if users feel that 
locationis a useful (or practical) way of describing such an in
formation object.
 
Chief amongst these tag properties appears to be the importance of both vernacularnames specific to 
individual cities, and more generally, place names, in describinggeoreferenced images. More than 70% of 
georeferenced images, and up to 35
% of tags,included at least one place name tag of some granularity,

reflecting the overall importanceof place names in tagging behavior, and tags at the granularity of cities 
dominate.
 
Users appear to have added the same taglist to a whole set of photosupl
oaded simultaneously. Overall, the 
relationship between misplaced and mistaggeditems suggests that most users take tagging seriously, but 
not all of them are willing orable to correctly locate images on a map when georeferencing

in other 
words people arebe
tter at describing what they have seen in terms of semantics than they are at assigning 
anaccurate georeference.

3.A Latent Variable Model for Geographic Lexical Variation
 
The rapid growth of geotagged social mediaraises new computational possibilities 
for 
investigatinggeographic linguistic variation. Inthis paper, we present a multi
-
level generativemodel that 
reasons jointly about latent topicsand geographical regions. High
-


geographic region,revealing topic
-
specific regional 
distinctions.Applied to a new dataset of geotagged microblogs,our model recovers coherent topicsand 
their regional variants, while identifyinggeographic areas of linguistic consistency.In this paper, we 
p
resent a method foridentifying geographically
-
aligned lexical variationdirectly from raw text. Our 
approach takes the formof a probabilistic graphical model capable of identifyingboth geographically
-
salient terms and coherentlinguistic communities.
 
One cha
llenge in the study of lexical variation isthat term frequencies are influenced by a variety 
offactors, such as the topic of discourse. We addressthis issue by adding latent variables that allow us 
tomodel topical variation explicitly. We hypothesizethat g

topicallexical distributions are corrupted by geographicalfactors; for example, a sports

related topic willbe

We develop a model that incorporates two sourcesof lexical variation: topic and geographical region.We 
treat the text and geographic locations as ou
tputsfrom a generative process that incorporates bothtopics 
and regions as latent variables.6 During inference,we seek to recover the topics and regions thatbest 
explain the observed data.
 
We see this work as a first step towards a unsupervisedmethodology 
for modeling linguistic 
variationusing raw text. Indeed, in a study of morphosyntacticvariation, Szmrecsanyi finds that bythe 
most generous measure, geographical factors accountfor only 33% of the observed variation. Ouranalysis

4.You Are Where You Tweet: A Content
-
Based Approach to Geo
-
Loca
ting Twitter Users
 
               
Three of the key featuresof the proposed approach are: (i) its reliance purely on tweetcontent, 
meaning no need for user IP information, privatelogin information, or external knowledge bases; (ii) a 
classification componen
t for automatically identifying words intweets with a strong local geo
-
scope; and 
(iii) a lattice
-
basedneighborhood smoothing model for refining a user's locationestimate. The system 
estimates k possible locations for eachuser in descending order of confid
ence. On average we  findthat the 
location estimates converge quickly, placing 51% of Twitter users within 100miles of their actual 
location.
 
Mining this people
-
centric sensor data promises new personalized information services, including local 
news summar
ized from tweets of nearby Twitter users, the targeting of regional advertisements, spreading 
business information to local customers, and novel location
-
based applications (e.g., Twitter
-
based 
earthquake detection, which canbe faster than through traditio
nal official channels).
 
To overcome this location sparsity problem, we proposein this paper to predict a user's location based 
purely onthe content of the user's tweets, even in the absence of anyother geospatial cues. Our intuition is 
that a user's tweets
may encode some location
-
specific content { either specificplace names or certain 
words or phrases more likely to beassociated with certain locations than othersfor people from Texas). In 
this way, we can ll
-
the
-
gap forthe 74% of Twitter users lacking city
-
level granular locationinformation.
 
The content
-
based approach relies ontwo key refinements: (i) a classification component for 
automatically identifying words in tweets with a strong localgeo
-
scope; and (ii) a lattice
-
based 
neighborhood smoothingmodel fo
r refining a user's location estimate. We have seenhow the location 
estimator can place 51% of Twitter userswithin 100 miles of their actual location.
 
To quantify the impact of an increasing amount of userinformation, we calculate the distribution of Error
 
Distanceand the Average Error Distance across all of the test usersbased on the Local Word ltering 
location estimator relyingon a range of tweets from 100 to 1000.The error distance distribution, where 
each point representsthe fraction of users with an er
ror in that range.

5.Kernel Density Estimation via Diffusion
 
              
We present a new adaptive kernel density estimator based onlinear diffusion processes. The 
proposed estimator builds on existingideas for adaptive smoothing by incorporating infor
mation from a 
pi
-
lot density estimate. In addition, we propose a new plug
-
in bandwidthselection method that is free from 
the arbitrary normal reference rulesused by existing methods. We present simulation examples in 
whichthe proposed approach outperforms 
existing methods in terms of accuracy and reliability.
 
The aim of this paper is to introduce an adaptive kernel density estimationmethod based on the smoothing 
properties of linear diffusion processes. Thekey idea is to view the kernel from which the estim
ator is 
constructed as thetransition density of a diffusion process. We utilize the most general lineardiffusion 
process that has a given limiting and stationary probability density. This stationary density is selected to 
be either a pilot density estimate
or a density that the statistician believes represents the information 
aboutthe data prior to observing the available empirical data. The approach leadsto a simple and intuitive 
kernel estimator with substantially reduced asymptotic bias and mean square er
ror. The proposed 
estimator deals well withboundary bias and, unlike other proposals, is always a bona fide 
probabilitydensity function.
 
The resulting diffusion estimator unifies many of the existing ideas about adaptivesmoothing. In addition, 
the estimato
r is consistent at boundaries. Numerical experiments suggest good practical performance. As 
future research, the
 
proposed estimator can be extended in a number of ways. First, we can construct kernel density estimators 
based on L´evy processes, which will 
havethe diffusion estimator as a special case. The kernels 
constructed via a L´evyprocess could be tailored for data for which smoothing with the Gaussiankernel 
density estimator or diffusion estimator is not optimal. Such casesarise when the data is a sam
ple from a 
heavy
-
tailed distribution. Second,more subtle and interesting smoothing models can be constructed by 
considering nonlinear parabolic PDEs.
 
The paper introduces an improved plug
-
in bandwidth selection method that completely avoids the normal 
reference rules that haveadversely affected the performance of plug
-
in methods. The new plug
-
inmethod 

Moreover, our plug
-
in approach doesnot involve numer
ical optimization and is not much slower than 
computinga normal reference rule.

CONCLUSION
 
                 
The geo tagging and time
-
tagging features of QDA Miner are part of its Hyper linking 
capability so that, in order to attach geographic coordinates
 
or a time stamp to a piece of qualitative 
information, you must first create a hyperlink. Hyper linking is typically conceived as a way of creating 
links that allow one to jump to another document or another location in the same document or to access 
exte
rnal resources such as a web page or another computer file. In QDA Miner, 
hyperlinks
 
are also used 
to store geographic and time coordinates. In the case of geographic information, one may then use such a 
hyperlink to quickly jump to a mapping tool like Goo
gle Earth and view the exact location corresponding 
to the geographic coordinates. This section will show you how to create those links. 
 
It could not be evaluated if a different weighting of the two (three) dimensions could improve retrieval 
performance. 
Connected to the latter point is the question of how many images per dimension should be 
retrieved and what the appropriate thresholds for retrieval scores (e.g. no images retrieved with a 
similarity score below 0.5) are. Additionally, different combinatio
nal strategies (different Comb 
strategies, Borda fusion instead of Comb) may prove to provide more relevant retrieval results.
 
The applications of geographic information in conjunction with roughly categorized as location 
recognition, object or event 
recognition, visualization, recommendation, social networking, and mapping. 
More generally, many of the applications are directed at helping a computer understand one or 
more15images, based on known relationships that record which objects are likely to be 
where in the 
world. Other applications consolidate a large
-
scale dataset of geo
-
tagged information to produce maps 
that indicate where things are in the world.
