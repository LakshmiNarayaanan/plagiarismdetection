I am trying to built a online book store and using django registration redux I have built a 2 way verification login system. After user login I want it to redirect to the main home page (/store in my case), but for some reason it's directing to accounts/profiles, I don't know from where is it fetching this url.
Here's my Settings.py code
import os
BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
# Quick-start development settings - unsuitable for production
# See https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/howto/deployment/checklist/
# SECURITY WARNING: keep the secret key used in production secret!
SECRET_KEY = '&icg8)16be&h!rw)6_#3#v!1dn5nx_*k1rv7lx@c(88tw5z6$a'
# SECURITY WARNING: don't run with debug turned on in production!
DEBUG = True
ALLOWED_HOSTS = []

INSTALLED_APPS = (
'django.contrib.admin',
'django.contrib.auth',
'django.contrib.contenttypes',

'django.contrib.messages',

'social.apps.django_app.default',
'store',
'registration',
)

'django.contrib.auth.middleware.SessionAuthenticationMiddleware',
'django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware',
'django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware',
'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
)
ROOT_URLCONF = 'bookstore.urls'
TEMPLATES = [
{
'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
'DIRS': [],
'APP_DIRS': True,
'OPTIONS': {
'context_processors': [
'django.template.context_processors.debug',
'django.template.context_processors.request',
'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',
'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',
'social.apps.django_app.context_processors.backends',
'social.apps.django_app.context_processors.login_redirect',
],
},
},
]
WSGI_APPLICATION = 'bookstore.wsgi.application'
AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
'social.backends.facebook.FacebookOAuth2',
'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend'
)
# Database
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/settings/#databases
DATABASES = {
'default': {
'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
}
}

# Static files (CSS, JavaScript, Images)
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/howto/static-files/
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
# Registration
ACCOUNT_ACTIVATION_DAYS = 7
REGISTRATION_AUTO_LOGIN = True
LOGIN_REDIRECT_USER = "/store/"
And here's my urls.py
from django.conf.urls import include, url
from django.contrib import admin
urlpatterns = [
# Examples:
# url(r'^$', 'bookstore.views.home', name='home'),
# url(r'^blog/', include('blog.urls')),
url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
url (r'^store/', include('store.urls'), name='store'),
url(r'^accounts/', include('registration.backends.default.urls')),
url ('', include('social.apps.django_app.urls', namespace = 'social')),
And My login.html
<form method = "post" action =".">
{% csrf_token %}
{{ form.as_p }}
<input type = "submit" value="LogIn"/>
<input type = "hidden" name = "next" value = "{{next}}"/>
</form>
<a href = " {% url 'social:begin' 'facebook' %}"> Login With Facebook</a>
A help is greatly appreciated

Is the error for normal login or login via facebook? Does "/store/" exist? Or is it only a root with no child url as r"^$"

You have used the wrong setting name. It should be
LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = "/store/"
You have LOGIN_REDIRECT_USER.
