Department Head: Professor Edward Swan
Office: 300 Butler Hall
The Department of Computer Science and Engineering is dedicated to maintaining quality programs in undergraduate teaching, graduate teaching, and research, and to the fruitful interaction between teaching and research. In research, we wish to maintain our present emphasis on applications (often pursued with colleagues from other disciplines), and upon the synergistic relationships between theory and applications in which the most meaningful advances often result. The department has identified six core competency areas in which we shall seek national prominence: artificial intelligence, computational science, human centered computing, graphics, systems, and software engineering. These core competencies support research applications in areas such as bio-informatics, high performance computing, computer security, computer forensics, computer science education, human-robotic interaction, and visualization. The Department of Computer Science and Engineering offers degree programs leading to the Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering, and (jointly with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering) Computer Engineering. The department also offers study leading to the Master of Science and the Doctor of Philosophy degrees in Computer Science. An accelerated BS/MS program is also available.
Computer Science Major (CS)
Major Advisor: Dr. Sarah Lee
300 Butler Hall
Computer Science is the study of the principles, applications, and technologies of computing and computers. It involves the study of data and data structures and the algorithms to process these structures; principles of computer architecture-both hardware and software; problem solving and design methodologies; and language design, structure and translation techniques. Computer Science provides a foundation of knowledge for students with career objectives in a wide range of computing and computer-related professions.
The objectives for the department with respect to the Bachelor of Science Degree in Computer Science are as follows:
The graduate will demonstrate an understanding of computer science principles and an ability to solve unstructured computer science problems through the successful entrance into and advancement in the computer science profession.
The graduate will demonstrate an appreciation for lifelong learning and for the value of continuing professional development through participation in graduate education, professional education or continuing education opportunities, attainment of professional licensure, or membership in professional societies.
The graduate will demonstrate an understanding of professional and ethical responsibilities to the profession, society and the environment incumbent on a computer science professional.
The graduate will successfully interact with others of different backgrounds, educations, and cultures.
The graduate will demonstrate effective communication skills in their profession.
Computer Science graduates begin careers as computer programmers, system analysts, programmer/analysts, software engineers, systems programmers, computer system engineers and in a number of other computer-related jobs. A minor in computer science is available to students with major programs of study in other fields at the University.
The Bachelor of Science degree requires the completion of a total of 128 credit hours of general studies, computer science, mathematics and science, and supporting technical courses. To graduate, a student must have a “C” average in all MSU computer science and engineering courses attempted.
The computer science program is accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org.
Software Engineering Major (SE)
Major Advisor: Dr. Sarah Lee

Software Engineering is the application of engineering practices to the design and maintenance of software. The Software Engineering degree program prepares students for careers in the engineering of large complex software systems and products. These systems often involve millions of lines of code and frequently operate in safety-critical environments. The Software Engineering major contains courses related to the study of software engineering in practice necessary to manage these development processes. The faculty for the Software Engineering program is drawn from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering and the Department of Industrial Engineering.
